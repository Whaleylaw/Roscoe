# Lien Resolution Workflow & Ethical Duties

## AI Paralegal Operational Workflow

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Lien Resolution & Ethical Disbursement Workflow**

### Goal
Successfully identify, verify, classify, negotiate, and resolve all third-party liens against a client's personal injury settlement while maintaining strict ethical compliance with trust account rules, client communication duties, and conflict of interest standards—resulting in maximum net recovery for the client and a fully documented, defensible audit trail.

### When to Use
- **Case Intake:** When onboarding a new personal injury client to establish initial lien exposure
- **Treatment Phase:** When new medical providers, insurers, or government programs become involved
- **Pre-Settlement:** When preparing settlement projections and negotiating with defendants
- **Post-Settlement:** When settlement funds are received and ready for distribution
- **Dispute Resolution:** When a client disputes a valid lien or a new lien is discovered late
- **Ongoing Monitoring:** Throughout the entire case lifecycle to track lien status changes

### Inputs Required

| Input Type | Description | Source |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Client medical history | Complete treatment records and provider list | Intake questionnaire, medical records |
| Insurance information | Health, auto, disability coverage details | Insurance cards, policy documents |
| Government benefits status | Medicare, Medicaid, VA/TRICARE enrollment | Client disclosure, CMS queries |
| Provider bills | Itemized statements from all treating providers | Medical providers, billing departments |
| Letters of Protection (LOPs) | Contractual lien agreements with providers | Case file, provider agreements |
| Lienholder correspondence | All communications from asserted lienholders | Mail, email, fax communications |
| Settlement details | Gross settlement amount, policy limits, liability assessment | Settlement agreement, insurance correspondence |
| Fee agreement | Scope of representation, fee structure | Retainer agreement |

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Phase 1: Lien Identification (Intake & Discovery)

**Step 1.1: Initial Lien Screening**
- [ ] Review client's complete medical history from intake questionnaire
- [ ] Document all insurance coverage (health, auto, disability, government)
- [ ] Query Medicare/Medicaid/VA status and document results
- [ ] Create master lien tracking register for the case

**Step 1.2: Provider Outreach**
- [ ] Contact all known medical providers to request:
  - Final account balances
  - Itemized billing ledgers
  - Any assignment or lien documentation
- [ ] Send formal notice letters to all health, auto, and disability insurers
- [ ] Document all outreach with date, method, and response received

**Step 1.3: Government Program Verification**
- [ ] If Medicare beneficiary: Request Conditional Payment Letter (CPL) from MSPRC
- [ ] If Medicaid recipient: Contact state Medicaid agency for lien amount
- [ ] If VA/TRICARE: Verify federal recovery rights and contact appropriate agency
- [ ] Document all government lien assertions with amounts and dates

---

#### Phase 2: Lien Verification & Classification

**Step 2.1: Validity Verification**
- [ ] For each asserted lien, verify:
  - [ ] Valid underlying debt exists
  - [ ] Proper statutory perfection (filing deadlines, required notices)
  - [ ] Correct calculation of amounts
  - [ ] Proper party identification
- [ ] Document any perfection defects or invalidity arguments

**Step 2.2: Classification Analysis**
For each verified lien, classify as:

| Classification | Characteristics | Governing Law |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Statutory** | Created by operation of law (Medicare, Medicaid, hospital liens) | Federal/State statute |
| **Contractual** | Created by agreement (LOPs, assignments, subrogation clauses) | Contract terms + state law |
| **Combination** | Both statutory and contractual elements (ERISA plans) | Federal law (ERISA preemption analysis) |

- [ ] Document classification for each lien
- [ ] Identify whether federal preemption applies (ERISA)
- [ ] Note applicable state protections (Made Whole, Anti-Subrogation)

---

#### Phase 3: Defense & Reduction Evaluation

**Step 3.1: Equitable Doctrine Analysis**
For each lien, evaluate applicability of:

- [ ] **Made Whole Doctrine**: Is the client fully compensated? Is doctrine waived by statute/contract?
- [ ] **Common Fund Doctrine**: Can lienholder share in attorney fees/costs?
- [ ] **Hardship Arguments**: Document client's financial circumstances

**Step 3.2: Bill Scrutiny**
- [ ] Review all itemized bills for:
  - [ ] Charges unrelated to the accident
  - [ ] Unreasonable charges (compare to Medicare/Medicaid rates)
  - [ ] Duplicate charges
  - [ ] Pre-existing condition treatments
- [ ] Calculate proposed reduction amount for each improper charge

**Step 3.3: Strategy Documentation**
- [ ] Document initial negotiation strategy for each lien
- [ ] Calculate target reduction percentage
- [ ] Identify strongest arguments for each lienholder type
- [ ] Flag for attorney review before initiating negotiations

---

#### Phase 4: Negotiation Execution

**Step 4.1: Lienholder Contact**
- [ ] Initiate contact with each lienholder (prioritize government liens)
- [ ] Present applicable reduction arguments:

| Argument Type | When to Use | Supporting Documentation |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| **Validity/Perfection Challenge** | Statutory liens with procedural defects | Filing records, deadline documentation |
| **Unreasonable/Unrelated Charges** | Bills with questionable items | Itemized bills, medical records |
| **Pro-Rata Fee Reduction** | All negotiable liens | Fee agreement, cost accounting |
| **Made Whole/Hardship** | Contractual liens, state-law governed | Settlement breakdown, client financials |
| **Litigation Risk** | Cases with liability issues | Case evaluation, liability analysis |
| **Limited Policy** | Small policy recoveries | Policy limits documentation |

**Step 4.2: Communication Documentation**
- [ ] Log every communication with lienholders:
  - Date and time
  - Contact method (call, email, letter)
  - Person contacted and their role
  - Content summary
  - Any offers or counter-offers
- [ ] Save all written correspondence to case file

**Step 4.3: Escalation for Attorney Guidance**
- [ ] Flag stalled negotiations for attorney intervention
- [ ] Document any lienholder refusal to negotiate
- [ ] Note deadlines for lienholder responses

---

#### Phase 5: Settlement Finalization

**Step 5.1: Written Confirmation**
- [ ] Obtain written confirmation of final negotiated amount from each lienholder
- [ ] Confirm reduction in writing (email acceptable as interim confirmation)

**Step 5.2: Lien Resolution Agreements**
- [ ] Secure formal, signed Lien Resolution Agreement from each lienholder stating:
  - Original lien amount
  - Negotiated/compromised amount
  - Confirmation that payment satisfies lien in full
  - Release language
- [ ] Store executed agreements in case file

**Step 5.3: Pre-Disbursement Verification**
- [ ] Verify all liens have written resolution agreements
- [ ] Confirm no new liens have been asserted
- [ ] Calculate final distribution breakdown

---

#### Phase 6: Ethical Disbursement

**Step 6.1: Client Settlement Statement**
- [ ] Prepare detailed Settlement Statement showing:
  - Gross settlement amount
  - Attorney fees calculation
  - Litigation costs itemization
  - Each lien (original and negotiated amounts)
  - Client's net recovery
- [ ] Present to client for review and questions
- [ ] Obtain client's written signature approving distribution

**Step 6.2: Trust Account Disbursement**
- [ ] Confirm settlement funds have cleared and are available
- [ ] Verify trust account balance matches expected amount
- [ ] Issue checks in this order:
  1. Lienholders (per signed agreements)
  2. Case costs
  3. Attorney fees
  4. Client net recovery
- [ ] Verify total disbursements equal total deposits exactly

**Step 6.3: Final Accounting**
- [ ] Prepare final written accounting for client showing every dollar in and out
- [ ] Provide client with copies of all lien resolution agreements
- [ ] Deliver final accounting and net recovery check to client
- [ ] Document delivery method and date

| Combination | ERISA plans | Federal preemption often applies | Limited (check plan language for discretion) |

### Ethical Rule Quick Reference
| Rule | Core Duty | Key Requirements |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1.15 | Safekeeping Property | Trust account, segregation, prompt notification, full accounting |
| 1.7 | Conflicts of Interest | No divided loyalty; scrutinize referral arrangements |

Re: Important Information About Medical Liens and Your Case

Dear {{client_name}},

As we begin working on your personal injury case, I want to ensure you understand how medical bills and other payments made on your behalf may affect your final recovery.

**What is a Lien?**
A lien is a legal claim that allows someone who paid for your medical treatment (like your health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid) to be repaid from any settlement or judgment you receive.

**What This Means for Your Case:**
- Medical providers, health insurers, and government programs may have a right to be repaid from your settlement
- We will work to identify all potential liens and negotiate reductions where possible
- Your final "net recovery" will be the settlement amount minus attorney fees, costs, and any lien payments

**Our Commitment:**
We will keep you informed about any liens as they are identified and provide you with a complete breakdown before you approve any settlement.

Please contact our office if you have any questions.

Sincerely,
{{attorney_name}}
```
