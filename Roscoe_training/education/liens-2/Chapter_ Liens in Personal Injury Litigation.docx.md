# **Chapter: Liens in Personal Injury Litigation**

# **Introduction**

Liens and subrogation rights play a central role in personal injury litigation. When an injured plaintiff receives compensation through a settlement or judgment, numerous third parties may assert claims against that recovery. These include medical providers, insurers, government programs, and even family support obligations. Understanding the different types of liens, the doctrines that limit or expand their enforceability, and the strategies for negotiating them is essential for effective representation. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the types of liens, key legal doctrines, government benefit considerations, negotiation strategies, and ethical issues involved in lien resolution.

# **Core Doctrines and Principles**

## **Liens, Subrogation, Assignments, and Reimbursement**

A **lien** is a legal interest in another party’s property. In personal injury cases, liens represent a third party’s claim to part of the plaintiff’s recovery. Liens may arise by statute, by contract, or through common law.

**Subrogation** allows a third party—often an insurer—to step into the shoes of the injured plaintiff and pursue recovery directly against the tortfeasor. Unlike a lien, which attaches to an existing settlement or judgment, subrogation involves asserting the injured party’s rights against the responsible party.

**Assignments** are contractual agreements in which an injured person transfers recovery rights to a third party, such as a medical provider through a Letter of Protection or a litigation funding company.

**Rights of reimbursement** are claims by benefit providers such as Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurers to be repaid directly from the plaintiff’s recovery when they have paid for medical expenses related to the injury.

## **Types of Liens**

1. **Statutory Liens**: Created by statute and subject to strict compliance requirements. Examples include hospital liens, workers’ compensation liens, child support liens, and Medicare/Medicaid claims.

2. **Contractual Liens**: Arise from agreements between the plaintiff and a third party, such as Letters of Protection or health insurance contracts.

3. **Combination Liens**: Involve both statutory and contractual elements, such as Federal Employee Health Benefit Plans (FEHBP) or ERISA plans. Self-funded ERISA plans are exempt from state regulation, while fully funded plans may be subject to state law.

## **Key Equitable Doctrines**

* **Made Whole Doctrine**: Prevents reimbursement until the injured party has been fully compensated for all losses. While recognized under common law, it is often disclaimed by statute or contract, particularly in ERISA contexts.

  * **Common Fund Doctrine**: Requires lienholders who benefit from a plaintiff’s recovery to share proportionally in attorney’s fees and costs. Medicare incorporates this principle by reducing its reimbursement to account for procurement costs.

# **Practical Applications and Procedures**

## **Negotiating Liens**

Attorneys must investigate lien validity, confirm perfection requirements, and scrutinize itemized charges for unrelated or unreasonable expenses. Common negotiation strategies include:

* Arguing lack of perfection or underlying debt.

  * Disputing unreasonable or unrelated medical charges.

  * Seeking pro-rata reductions for attorney’s fees.

  * Invoking equitable defenses, where not disclaimed.

  * Leveraging hardship or doubtful claim arguments.

  * Delaying settlement to maintain leverage, particularly in ERISA cases.

## **Medicare and Medicaid Liens**

**Medicare** operates under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, making it a secondary payer to liability insurance. It has powerful recovery rights, including the ability to sue beneficiaries, insurers, and attorneys for double damages if not reimbursed. Medicare’s recovery includes conditional payments, which must be repaid once a settlement occurs. Reductions are available for procurement costs, and parties may seek waivers or compromises.

**Medicaid** is a joint federal-state program with state-specific rules. It requires reimbursement from personal injury recoveries for accident-related medical expenses but poses unique challenges in maintaining eligibility. Strategies such as spend down, Special Needs Trusts (for those under 65), and pooled/community trusts (for older beneficiaries) can preserve benefits while resolving liens.

**VA and TRICARE** programs also assert reimbursement rights for injury-related care, with TRICARE operating as a separate military family benefit system.

## **Medicare Set-Asides (MSAs)**

An **MSA** is a designated portion of a settlement set aside to cover future medical expenses that Medicare would otherwise pay. Though not explicitly required by statute, MSAs are considered the preferred method of compliance. They are necessary when settlements release claims for future or lifetime medical care. MSAs include foreseeable medical costs such as surgeries, medications, and durable medical equipment. Avoiding an MSA may be possible through a strong certification from the treating provider that no future care is required. Failure to properly address MSAs risks shifting costs to Medicare and denial of coverage until the settlement is exhausted.

# **Case Examples**

Several Supreme Court cases shape lien enforcement:

* **Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic (2006)**: Upheld an ERISA plan’s right to equitable reimbursement when it identified specific settlement funds.

  * **US Airways v. McCutchen (2013)**: Held that ERISA plan language can override equitable doctrines like Common Fund.

  * **Coventry Health Care v. Nevils (2017)**: Established that FEHBP plan provisions preempt state law.

  * **Gallardo v. Marstiller (2022)**: Allowed Medicaid to recover from settlement amounts allocated to both past and future medical expenses.

# **Ethical Duties**

Attorneys handling liens face significant ethical responsibilities:

* **Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping Funds)**: Requires prompt notice, segregation, and proper distribution of settlement funds, holding disputed portions in trust until resolved.

  * **Rule 1.7 (Conflicts of Interest)**: Prohibits agreements that compromise client interests, such as referral arrangements with medical providers.

  * **Rule 1.4 (Communication)**: Requires clear, early communication with clients about lien implications and settlement outcomes.

  * **Rule 5.3 (Nonlawyer Assistance)**: Holds attorneys responsible for the actions of staff and third-party vendors handling lien resolution.

Failure to comply can result in malpractice claims or direct government action against attorneys.

# **Challenges and Pitfalls**

* **Complexity of ERISA Plans**: Determining whether a plan is self-funded or fully insured is critical to assessing defenses.

  * **Preserving Benefits**: Settlements may inadvertently disqualify clients from Medicaid or Medicare benefits if planning is inadequate.

  * **Timing**: Delays in settlement or lien resolution can erode client recovery.

  * **Over-delegation**: Excessive reliance on third-party lien resolution services without oversight risks ethical violations.

# **Conclusion**

Lien resolution in personal injury litigation is a complex intersection of statutory law, contract interpretation, equitable doctrines, and ethical practice. Effective advocacy requires early identification of liens, diligent verification of their validity, and careful negotiation to maximize client recovery. Attorneys must balance the competing interests of clients, lienholders, and government entities, all while complying with strict ethical rules. Mastery of lien law is therefore essential to competent personal injury practice.

# **Discussion Questions and Hypotheticals**

1. A client’s health insurer has paid $40,000 in medical expenses following an accident. The insurer demands reimbursement from the client’s $50,000 settlement. How would you distinguish between a lien and subrogation in advising the client?

2. A hospital files a lien under state law but fails to perfect it by missing the statutory filing deadline. Separately, the client has signed a Letter of Protection with a chiropractor. Which of these claims is enforceable, and why?

3. A plaintiff recovers only half of their total damages through settlement. Their ERISA plan seeks full reimbursement of medical expenses. How does the “Made Whole Doctrine” apply, and what impact does ERISA have?

4. A client’s recovery creates a fund from which Medicare seeks reimbursement. How does the Common Fund Doctrine affect Medicare’s recovery, and why?

5. A Medicaid recipient obtains a large personal injury settlement. What planning strategies might be used to preserve their eligibility while satisfying Medicaid’s reimbursement rights?

6. An attorney signs an agreement with a medical provider guaranteeing payment of a portion of settlement proceeds. Later, the client disputes the charges. What ethical issues arise, and how should the attorney respond?

7. A 62-year-old plaintiff claims future medical expenses as part of a settlement. What steps should counsel take to determine whether a Medicare Set-Aside is necessary, and what risks exist if none is established?

8. A lienholder seeks the full billed amount of $120,000, though insurance would have paid

   $40,000 for the same services. What arguments might you raise to negotiate a

   reduction?

9. Why might it be strategically advantageous to delay settlement until a lien agreement is reached, particularly in ERISA cases?

10. How do the holdings in *Sereboff*, *McCutchen*, and *Gallardo* illustrate the balance between contractual plan language, equitable doctrines, and statutory requirements in lien resolution?

   * Contact known providers and insurers.

2. ### **Verify Validity and Perfection**

   * Confirm statutory compliance (filings, notices).

   * Obtain contracts for Letters of Protection or assignments.

3. ### **Classify the Lien**

   * Determine whether statutory, contractual, or combination.

   * Assess whether state or federal law governs.

4. ### **Evaluate Defenses and Reductions**

   * Consider Made Whole or Common Fund doctrines (if applicable).

   * Review charges for reasonableness and relation to the injury.

5. ### **Negotiate with Lienholders**

   * Communicate early and often.

   * Present hardship, doubtful claim, or proportional reduction arguments.

6. ### **Finalize Settlement and Lien Agreement**

   * Delay final settlement if necessary to preserve leverage.

   * Secure written lien resolution agreements.

7. ### **Disburse Funds Ethically**

   * Segregate client funds in trust.

   * Hold disputed funds until resolution.

   * Provide full accounting to client and lienholders.

# **Case Study: Resolving Multiple Liens in a Settlement**

### **Facts:**

Jane Doe, age 58, suffers serious injuries in a car accident. She incurs $150,000 in hospital bills, $30,000 in chiropractic treatment under a Letter of Protection, and receives $50,000 in Medicaid-paid medical care. Jane’s total damages exceed $500,000, but she settles her case for the defendant’s $200,000 policy limits.

### **Lienholders:**

* Hospital files a statutory lien for $150,000 but failed to perfect it within the statutory deadline.

* Chiropractor asserts a contractual lien under the Letter of Protection for $30,000.

* Medicaid asserts a statutory lien for $50,000.

### **Resolution:**

1. The hospital lien is unenforceable due to failure of perfection, but the underlying debt remains. Jane may still face collection efforts, so counsel negotiates a reduced  
   out-of-pocket payment of $20,000 to resolve the account.

2. The chiropractor’s lien is valid and enforceable under contract. Counsel negotiates a reduction to $15,000 based on hardship and proportionality arguments.

3. Medicaid’s lien must be honored. Counsel secures a pro-rata reduction for attorney’s fees and costs, lowering the repayment obligation to $35,000.

### **Distribution:**

After reductions, lien obligations total $70,000, leaving Jane with a net recovery of $80,000 after attorney’s fees and costs. Medicaid eligibility is preserved through the creation of a Special Needs Trust for Jane’s portion of the recovery.

### **Teaching Point:**

This case illustrates the importance of lien classification, perfection requirements, equitable doctrines, and negotiation strategies in maximizing client recovery while satisfying legal and ethical obligations.
