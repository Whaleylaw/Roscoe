## Detailed Specifications for Each Report

---

### Report 1: Lien Fundamentals & Classification

**Purpose:**
This foundational report establishes the conceptual vocabulary and classification framework that an AI paralegal must understand before handling any lien-related tasks. It defines the precise distinctions between liens, subrogation, assignments, and reimbursement rights—terms often confused but legally distinct. The AI must understand why classification matters: it determines which laws apply, what defenses are available, and which negotiation strategies work.

**Intended Use in AI Paralegal OS:**
- **When:** At case intake and initial lien identification
- **How:** When a new case involves potential third-party claims, the AI references this module to properly categorize each claim and flag the applicable legal framework
- **Integration:** Feeds into all downstream lien modules; serves as prerequisite knowledge

**Core Topics & Sections:**
- Definition of "lien" in personal injury context
- Definition and distinction: subrogation vs. lien
- Definition and examples: assignments (including LOPs and litigation funding)
- Definition: rights of reimbursement
- Three-category classification system:
  - Statutory liens (hospital, workers' comp, child support, Medicare/Medicaid)
  - Contractual liens (LOPs, private insurance)
  - Combination liens (FEHBP, ERISA plans)
- Why classification determines strategy:
  - Statutory = strict compliance requirements
  - Contractual = governed by agreement terms plus applicable regulations
  - Combination = federal preemption analysis required
- Quick-reference classification decision tree

**Source Coverage:**
All four source documents cover these fundamentals extensively. The Chapter provides formal definitions; the FAQ offers accessible Q&A explanations; the Briefing provides practical distinctions; the Study Guide includes the most comprehensive glossary.

**Report Type Recommendation:**
**Training manual / study guide** — This report should teach foundational concepts with clear definitions, examples, and a classification framework the AI can apply repeatedly.

**Intended Use in AI Paralegal OS:**
- **When:** During lien identification and validation phase
- **How:** When a hospital or workers' comp lien is asserted, the AI runs a validation checklist, flags perfection defects, and generates challenge arguments

**Core Topics & Sections:**
- Hospital lien perfection requirements:
  - Filing deadlines (state-specific)
  - Notice requirements
  - Recording with clerk's office

## Summary

I've designed a **6-report modular framework** that transforms your lien education materials into an AI Paralegal Operating System backbone:

| # | Report Title | Type | Primary Use |
|---|--------------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Lien Fundamentals & Classification | Training manual | Foundational knowledge at intake |
| 2 | Statutory & Hospital Liens | Practical playbook | Validation and challenge procedures |
| 3 | ERISA & Contractual Liens | Mixed: manual + playbook | Complex plan investigation and negotiation |
| 4 | Government Health Benefits | Practical playbook | Medicare/Medicaid/VA/TRICARE procedures |
| 5 | Medicare Set-Asides (MSAs) | Mixed: manual + playbook | MSA compliance and strategy |
| 6 | Lien Resolution Workflow & Ethical Duties | Practical playbook | Master operational workflow |

Each report is self-contained, covers coherent subject matter, and includes actionable checklists, procedures, and data capture requirements that can feed directly into AI paralegal operational workflows and prompts.
