# Statutory & Hospital Liens: Identification, Perfection, and Challenge

## Operational Workflow

---

### Workflow Name
**Statutory Lien Validation and Challenge Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successfully validate or invalidate all statutory liens asserted against a client's personal injury recovery by:
1. Systematically verifying perfection requirements for each lien
2. Identifying procedural defects that render liens unenforceable
3. Generating challenge arguments for defective or excessive liens
4. Calculating maximum allowable lien amounts under applicable statutory caps
5. Producing a comprehensive lien validation report with actionable recommendations for the supervising attorney

**Success looks like:** Every statutory lien has been audited, defects documented, challenge arguments prepared, and a clear recommendation (valid/challengeable/reducible) provided with supporting evidence.

---

### When to Use

**Trigger Conditions:**
- A hospital lien notice is received or discovered in the case file
- Workers' compensation carrier asserts a subrogation/lien claim
- Child support agency asserts a claim against settlement proceeds
- Settlement negotiations are beginning and lien inventory is required
- Attorney requests lien validation before disbursement
- Any statutory lien is asserted against the client's recovery
- Pre-settlement lien resolution phase begins

---

### Inputs Required

| Input | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Lien Notice Documents** | Formal lien filings, notices, and correspondence from lienholders | Case file, court records, mail |
| **Itemized Medical Bills** | Detailed billing statements showing charges, payments, and balances | Medical providers, client |
| **Insurance EOBs** | Explanation of Benefits showing amounts paid/allowed by insurers | Client's health insurer |
| **State Statute Reference** | Applicable hospital lien statute for the jurisdiction | Legal research database |
| **Filing Records** | County/circuit clerk records showing lien filing date and location | Court clerk's office |
| **Settlement Amount** | Total settlement or expected recovery amount | Attorney/case file |
| **Client Information** | Client name, case context, injury details | Intake documents |
| **Workers' Comp Records** | Benefits paid, carrier information (if applicable) | WC carrier, client |
| **Child Support Status** | Any existing child support obligations (if applicable) | State agency inquiry |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Lien Identification and Classification**

**Step 1.1 — Inventory All Asserted Liens**
- Compile a complete list of all statutory liens asserted against the client's recovery
- Gather all lien notices, correspondence, and supporting documentation
- Create a lien tracking table with: lienholder name, lien type, asserted amount, date received

**Step 1.2 — Classify Each Lien by Type**
- Categorize each lien into its statutory category:
  - **Hospital Lien** — Requires strict perfection (filing, deadlines, notice)
  - **Workers' Compensation Lien** — Typically attaches automatically upon benefit payment
  - **Child Support Lien** — "Secret lien" requiring proactive discovery
  - **Other Statutory Lien** — Medicaid, Medicare, ERISA (handle per specific rules)

**Step 1.3 — Identify Governing Jurisdiction**
- Determine which state's laws govern each lien
- Note that hospital liens are state-specific with varying requirements
- Document the applicable statute citation for each lien type

---

#### **Phase 2: Hospital Lien Perfection Validation**

**Step 2.1 — Execute Hospital Lien Validation Checklist**

For each hospital lien, systematically answer:

| Checklist Item | Status | Evidence/Notes |
|----------------|--------|----------------|
| Was the lien filed with the **correct** county/circuit court clerk? | ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Unknown | |
| Was the lien filed **within the statutory deadline**? | ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Unknown | |
| Was **proper notice** provided to client and/or counsel? | ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Unknown | |
| Is there a **valid underlying debt** (not extinguished by insurance)? | ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ Unknown | |
| Does the lien amount comply with **statutory percentage caps**? | ☐ Yes ☐ No ☐ N/A | |

**Step 2.2 — Verify Filing Compliance**
- Obtain the lien filing record from the appropriate clerk's office
- Compare the filing date against the statutory deadline
- Confirm the filing was made in the correct venue (county of treatment or residence as required)

**Step 2.3 — Check for Balance Billing Violations**
- Compare the billed amount to the insurance-accepted amount
- Determine if the provider accepted insurance payment in full satisfaction
- If provider accepted insurance payment, assess whether state law prohibits balance billing
- **Key Principle:** If insurance payment extinguished the debt, no lien can attach because "if there is no underlying debt, then there is no lien"

**Step 2.4 — Calculate Statutory Cap Limitations**
- Apply state-specific percentage caps:
  - **Tennessee:** Hospital cannot collect more than 1/3 of client's settlement
  - **Indiana:** 20% rule limits hospital recovery
  - **Other states:** Research and apply applicable caps
- Calculate maximum allowable lien amount: `Settlement Amount × Cap Percentage = Maximum Lien`

---

#### **Phase 3: Workers' Compensation Lien Analysis**

**Step 3.1 — Confirm Automatic Attachment**
- Workers' compensation liens typically attach automatically upon benefit payment
- No separate filing is usually required for perfection
- Verify the total benefits paid by the WC carrier

**Step 3.2 — Distinguish State vs. Federal Claims**
- State WC liens: Governed by state subrogation statutes
- Federal FECA (Federal Employees' Compensation Act): Different rules apply
- Document which regime controls

**Step 3.3 — Identify Reduction Opportunities**
- Check for statutory requirements to share litigation costs
- Apply any "made whole" doctrines recognized in the jurisdiction
- Calculate reduced amount after cost-sharing

---

#### **Phase 4: Child Support Lien Discovery**

**Step 4.1 — Conduct Proactive Discovery**
- Child support liens are "secret liens" unrelated to the injury claim
- Contact the state child support enforcement agency directly
- Request confirmation of any outstanding child support obligations
- Document the inquiry date and response received

**Step 4.2 — Assess Impact on Disbursement**
- If a child support lien exists, determine the amount claimed
- Verify if the lien attaches to personal injury settlements in this jurisdiction
- Flag for immediate attorney review before disbursement

---

#### **Phase 5: Challenge Argument Generation**

**Step 5.1 — Compile Perfection Defects**
For each defect identified, generate a challenge argument:

| Defect Type | Challenge Argument Template |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Missed Filing Deadline** | "The lien is legally unenforceable because [Lienholder] failed to file within the [X]-day statutory deadline. The lien was filed on [Date], which is [X] days after the deadline expired on [Deadline Date]." |
| **Improper Filing Venue** | "The lien was filed with [Incorrect Office] rather than the [Correct Office] as required by [Statute Citation], rendering it unperfected and unenforceable." |
| **Balance Billing Violation** | "No underlying debt remains for this lien to attach to. [Lienholder] accepted payment from [Insurance Plan] on [Date], which extinguished the debt under [State Law]. The attempted balance billing is prohibited." |
| **Exceeds Statutory Cap** | "The asserted lien amount of $[Amount] exceeds the statutory maximum of [Cap %] of the settlement. Under [Statute Citation], the lien must be reduced to $[Calculated Maximum]." |
| **Failure to Provide Notice** | "The lien is unenforceable due to failure to provide the required notice to [Client/Counsel] as mandated by [Statute Citation]." |

**Step 5.2 — Dispute Unreasonable Charges**
- Review the itemized bill supporting the lien
- Identify charges not reasonably related to the personal injury treatment
- Flag charges exceeding customary rates for the services
- Document specific line items to challenge

---

#### **Phase 6: Documentation and Reporting**

**Step 6.1 — Prepare Lien Validation Summary**
Create a comprehensive report including:
- Lien inventory table with all asserted liens
- Validation status for each lien (Valid / Challengeable / Reducible)
- Identified defects with supporting evidence
- Challenge arguments for each defective lien
- Statutory cap calculations
- Recommended actions

**Step 6.2 — Calculate Net Impact**
- Total asserted liens: $[Sum]
- Liens validated as enforceable: $[Sum]
- Liens challengeable as invalid: $[Sum]
- Liens reducible under statutory caps: $[Sum of reductions]
- Potential client savings: $[Total potential savings]

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### **Validation Checks**
- ☐ Every lien has been classified by type and governing jurisdiction
- ☐ All checklist items answered with supporting evidence documented
- ☐ Filing dates verified against actual clerk records (not just lienholder's assertion)
- ☐ Statutory deadlines calculated from the correct triggering event
- ☐ Insurance EOBs reviewed for balance billing analysis
- ☐ State-specific percentage caps researched and applied correctly
- ☐ All challenge arguments cite specific statute provisions

#### **Red Flags Requiring Immediate Attorney Escalation**

| Red Flag | Why Escalate | Urgency |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Missed Perfection Deadline** | Lien may be entirely unenforceable — significant leverage opportunity | HIGH |
| **Balance Billing After Insurance Payment** | Potential to eliminate entire lien | HIGH |
| **Lien Exceeds Statutory Cap** | Automatic reduction argument available | MEDIUM |
| **Late-Discovered Child Support Lien** | May block disbursement; requires immediate resolution | URGENT |
| **Notice Defect Identified** | Potential enforceability challenge | MEDIUM |
| **Unclear Statutory Requirements** | Legal research needed beyond paralegal scope | MEDIUM |
| **Multiple Conflicting Liens** | Priority dispute may require attorney guidance | MEDIUM |

#### **Limitations — Do Not:**
- ❌ Provide final legal conclusions on lien validity
- ❌ Negotiate directly with lienholders without attorney authorization
- ❌ Advise the client on whether to pay or contest a lien
- ❌ Interpret ambiguous statutory language without attorney review
- ❌ Disburse settlement funds until all lien issues are resolved
