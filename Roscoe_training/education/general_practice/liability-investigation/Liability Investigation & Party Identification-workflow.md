# Liability Investigation & Party Identification

## Operational Workflow for AI Paralegal

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Comprehensive Liability Investigation & Party Identification Protocol**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means:
- All potentially liable parties have been systematically identified and documented
- Each party's relationship to the incident and applicable legal theory is mapped
- All associated insurance policies are identified with coverage limits
- Evidence supporting liability theories has been preserved and catalogued
- Red flags have been identified and escalated to supervising attorney
- A comprehensive liability matrix is produced for case strategy development

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- A new personal injury case is opened (immediately after intake)
- New facts emerge suggesting additional liable parties
- Discovery reveals previously unknown relationships (employment, ownership, corporate structure)
- Defense raises an "Empty Chair" defense in pleadings
- Statute of limitations is approaching and all parties must be identified for joinder
- Insurance coverage appears insufficient and alternative recovery sources are needed
- A hit-and-run or unidentified tortfeasor situation exists

---

### Inputs Required

| Input Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Accident/Incident Report** | Police report, incident report, or initial narrative |
| **Client Intake Information** | Names, contact info, initial statement |
| **Scene Evidence** | Photos, measurements, witness statements |
| **Vehicle Information** | Make/model, ownership records, registration |
| **Insurance Documentation** | All known policies (at-fault party, client's own coverage) |
| **Medical Records** | Initial treatment records establishing injury |
| **Employment Information** | Any known employment status of at-fault party |
| **Location Details** | Address, property ownership, environmental factors |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Primary Liability Analysis**

**Step 1.1 — Identify Direct Tortfeasor**
- Extract at-fault party name(s) from accident report
- Document the specific negligent act(s) alleged
- Map facts to the four elements of negligence:
  - [ ] **Duty**: What duty of care was owed?
  - [ ] **Breach**: How was that duty breached?
  - [ ] **Causation**: Factual ("but for") and proximate cause established?
  - [ ] **Damages**: What compensable harm resulted?

**Step 1.2 — Check for Negligence Per Se**
- Cross-reference incident facts with applicable traffic statutes
- Identify any statutory violations (speeding, red light, DUI, etc.)
- Document statute citation and how violation relates to injury
- Flag: Statutory violation = presumption of negligence (shifts burden of proof)

---

#### **Phase 2: Secondary Liability Investigation (Who Else?)**

**Step 2.1 — Employer Liability Analysis**
- [ ] Was at-fault driver employed at time of incident?
- [ ] Was driver acting within course and scope of employment?
- [ ] Identify employer's full legal name and corporate structure
- [ ] Locate employer's commercial insurance policy
- **Legal Theory**: Respondeat superior (employer liable for employee's negligence in scope of employment)

**Step 2.2 — Vehicle Ownership Analysis**
- [ ] Is driver the registered owner of the vehicle?
- [ ] If not, identify vehicle owner (individual or entity)
- [ ] Investigate whether owner knew driver was unfit (prior DUI, suspended license, etc.)
- **Legal Theory**: Negligent entrustment (owner liable for entrusting vehicle to unfit driver)

**Step 2.3 — Product Defect Analysis**
- [ ] Could a mechanical failure have contributed to the incident?
- [ ] Identify vehicle manufacturer
- [ ] Identify parts manufacturer (brakes, tires, steering)
- [ ] Identify recent maintenance providers
- **Legal Theory**: Products liability / Negligent maintenance

**Step 2.4 — Commercial Vehicle Regulations**
- [ ] Is this a commercial vehicle subject to FMCSA regulations?
- [ ] Check for Hours of Service violations
- [ ] Check for maintenance/inspection violations
- [ ] Check driver qualification requirements
- **Legal Theory**: Regulatory violation = independent basis for liability

---

#### **Phase 3: Location-Based Liability (Where?)**

**Step 3.1 — Premises Liability Investigation**
- [ ] Did a hazardous condition on property contribute to incident?
- [ ] Identify property owner (private or public entity)
- [ ] Document sight obstructions, poor lighting, surface conditions
- **Legal Theory**: Premises liability (property owner's duty to maintain safe conditions)

**Step 3.2 — Government Entity Liability**
- [ ] Road design defect?
- [ ] Malfunctioning traffic signals?
- [ ] Improper signal timing?
- [ ] Inadequate signage or markings?
- [ ] Note: Government claims have special notice requirements and shorter deadlines
- **Legal Theory**: Municipal liability (sovereign immunity exceptions)

**Step 3.3 — Special Location Rules**
- [ ] Does location trigger immunity statutes? (parks, recreational areas)
- [ ] Any construction zones with contractor involvement?

---

#### **Phase 4: Circumstance-Based Liability (What Happened?)**

**Step 4.1 — Dram Shop Investigation**
- [ ] Evidence of intoxication by at-fault driver?
- [ ] Identify last establishment(s) where alcohol was served
- [ ] Document timeline: service → departure → incident
- [ ] Was driver visibly intoxicated when served?
- **Legal Theory**: Dram shop liability (establishment liable for over-serving visibly intoxicated person)

**Step 4.2 — Intentional Conduct Analysis**
- [ ] Any evidence of road rage or intentional assault?
- [ ] Note: May trigger intentional tort exclusion in insurance
- [ ] BUT: May reveal significant personal assets of tortfeasor

---

#### **Phase 5: Corporate Structure Investigation**

**Step 5.1 — Entity Identification**
- Use Secretary of State database to identify:
  - [ ] Exact legal name of corporate entity
  - [ ] Registered agent for service of process
  - [ ] Parent companies / subsidiaries
  - [ ] Officers and directors

**Step 5.2 — Investigation Resources**
- [ ] Online search indices (truepeoplesearch.com, etc.)
- [ ] State DMV records (driving history)
- [ ] Professional licensing boards
- [ ] Court records (PACER for federal, state systems for local)
- [ ] Business registration databases

---

#### **Phase 6: Insurance Coverage Mapping**

**Step 6.1 — Third-Party Liability Policies**
- [ ] At-fault driver's personal auto policy
- [ ] Vehicle owner's policy (if different from driver)
- [ ] Employer's commercial policy
- [ ] Umbrella/excess policies
- [ ] Premises liability policies

**Step 6.2 — First-Party Coverage (Client's Own)**
- [ ] Uninsured Motorist (UM) coverage
- [ ] Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage
- [ ] Medical Payments (MedPay) coverage
- [ ] Health insurance (document for subrogation management)
- [ ] Medicare/Medicaid involvement

---

#### **Phase 7: Evidence Preservation**

**Step 7.1 — Scene Documentation**
- [ ] Photographs of scene, vehicles, injuries
- [ ] Measurements and diagrams
- [ ] Environmental conditions noted

**Step 7.2 — Surveillance Footage**
- [ ] Canvass for Ring doorbells, business security cameras
- [ ] Issue preservation letters immediately

**Step 7.3 — Social Media Protocol**
- [ ] Investigate opposing party's social media for evidence
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Advise supervising attorney to counsel client:
  - Stop posting new content about case
  - **DO NOT DELETE** existing posts (spoliation risk)

**Step 7.4 — Vehicle Preservation**
- [ ] Issue spoliation letter to preserve vehicles
- [ ] Arrange for expert inspection if mechanical failure suspected

---

#### **Phase 8: Witness Identification & Contact**

**Step 8.1 — Witness List Compilation**
- [ ] Eyewitnesses from police report
- [ ] Good Samaritans / first responders
- [ ] Passengers in all vehicles
- [ ] Nearby residents or business employees

**Step 8.2 — Ethical Boundaries**
- **CRITICAL**: Under ABA Model Rule 4.2, do NOT contact any person known to be represented by counsel without that counsel's consent
- This applies to all represented "persons," not just formal "parties"
- When in doubt, escalate to supervising attorney

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All four elements of negligence mapped for each defendant
- [ ] Legal theory identified for each potentially liable party
- [ ] At least one insurance policy identified for each defendant
- [ ] Evidence preservation letters issued where applicable
- [ ] Witness contact information verified and current
- [ ] Corporate entities verified through official sources

#### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation

| Red Flag | Action Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Statute of Limitations approaching** | Immediate escalation — file complaint at least 150 days before SOL |
| **"Empty Chair" defense raised** | Immediate escalation — evaluate amending complaint to add named non-party |
| **Unidentified/Judgment-proof defendant** | Escalate + pivot to UM/UIM coverage analysis |
| **Evidence of spoliation by opposing party** | Immediate escalation for sanctions motion |
| **Government entity involvement** | Escalate for special notice/deadline requirements |
| **Medicare/Medicaid involvement** | Escalate for lien compliance requirements |
| **Client posting on social media** | Urgent escalation for client counseling |

#### When to Escalate to Attorney
- Any statute of limitations within 180 days
- Any new defendant identified requiring amendment
- Any insurance coverage dispute or denial
- Any ethical question about witness contact
- Any discovery of government entity involvement
- Any situation where judgment-proof defendant creates recovery gap

## Quick Reference Card

### The "Who, Where, What" Framework

| Question | Parties to Investigate | Legal Theories |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **WHO** is liable? | Driver, Employer, Vehicle Owner, Manufacturer, Maintenance Co. | Negligence, Respondeat Superior, Negligent Entrustment, Products Liability |
| **WHERE** did it happen? | Property Owner, Municipality, Construction Contractor | Premises Liability, Government Liability |
| **WHAT** were the circumstances? | Bar/Restaurant, Intentional Actor | Dram Shop Liability, Intentional Torts |

### Critical Deadlines

| Situation | Action | Timing |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| SOL approaching | File complaint | At least 150 days before expiration |
| Government entity | Notice of claim | Often 60-180 days (varies by jurisdiction) |
| Evidence spoliation risk | Preservation letter | Immediately upon case opening |

### Insurance Coverage Hierarchy

1. **At-fault driver's personal policy**
2. **Vehicle owner's policy** (if different)
3. **Employer's commercial policy**
4. **Umbrella/excess policies**
5. **Client's UM/UIM coverage** (if defendants insufficient)
6. **Client's MedPay** (regardless of fault)
