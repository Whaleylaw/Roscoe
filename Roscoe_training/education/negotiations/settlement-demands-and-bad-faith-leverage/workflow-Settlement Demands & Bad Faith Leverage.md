# Settlement Demands & Bad Faith Leverage

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Strategic Settlement Communication & Bad Faith Record Construction Protocol**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means:
1. **Policy limits tender achieved** through a systematic communication campaign that empowers the adjuster to justify reserve increases
2. **Comprehensive bad faith record constructed** documenting what the insurer knew and when, establishing clear evidence of unreasonable conduct if settlement fails
3. **Client recovery maximized** through strategic leverage of bad faith exposure, punitive damages potential, and duty-to-tender obligations

---

### When to Use
**Trigger Conditions:**
- Client retained for personal injury claim with clear liability
- Policy limits identified and documented damages likely to exceed coverage
- Initial medical records received showing objective injury findings
- Treatment ongoing with potential for surgery or permanent impairment
- Aggravating circumstances present (DUI, egregious conduct, punitive exposure)
- Insurer demonstrates delay tactics, lowball offers, or bad faith indicators
- Approaching maximum medical improvement (MMI) with need for final demand
- Pre-mediation preparation required

---

### Inputs Required

| Input Category | Specific Documents/Data |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Liability Evidence** | Police crash report, photos (vehicle damage, scene, injuries), witness statements, citations issued |
| **Medical Documentation** | ER records/bills, treating physician notes, MRI/imaging reports, surgery recommendations, MMI reports, disability ratings |
| **Financial Records** | Property damage estimates, total loss letters, medical bills itemization, lost wage documentation |
| **Insurance Information** | Policy limits (UM/UIM and liability), claim numbers, adjuster contact information, prior settlement offers |
| **Client History** | Prior claims history letter from own insurer, 5-10 years pre-accident medical records |
| **Case-Specific** | Criminal case records (if DUI), expert reports, future care cost estimates |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **PHASE 1: Initial Representation Package (Within 30 Days of Retention)**

**Step 1.1: Compile Initial Documentation Package**
- [ ] Obtain and review police crash report for fault indicators and citations
- [ ] Collect all photographs (vehicle damage, scene conditions, visible injuries)
- [ ] Secure property damage estimate or total loss declaration
- [ ] Request emergency transport and ER records with billing
- [ ] Obtain client's prior claims history letter from their auto insurer

**Step 1.2: Draft Initial Representation Letter**
Structure the letter with these required sections:
1. **Notice & Basic Facts**: Client name, insured identity, date of loss, claim number
2. **Liability Statement**: Reference police report, cite specific fault indicators ("insured cited for failure to yield")
3. **Injury & Treatment Summary**: Describe ER-documented injuries and current treatment status
4. **Document Preview**: List all enclosed documents, frame as cooperative effort ("to assist in fair evaluation and appropriate reserves")
5. **Future Documentation Notice**: Build anticipation ("client scheduled for orthopedic evaluation on [Date]")

**Step 1.3: Transmit Package and Log**
- Send via certified mail with delivery confirmation
- Log date, contents, and delivery confirmation in case file
- Calendar follow-up dates for Update Letter #1

---

#### **PHASE 2: Update Letter Campaign (60-180 Days Post-Retention)**

**Step 2.1: Update Letter #1 – Clinical Suspicion (60-90 Days)**
- [ ] Compile treating physician records showing persistent symptoms
- [ ] Document clinical findings (positive provocative tests, neurological signs)
- [ ] Include physician's order for advanced diagnostics (MRI, EMG)
- [ ] **Critical Language**: Include exact phrase: *"As soon as we receive the imaging report, I will promptly provide it to you, good, bad, or ugly..."*
- [ ] Log transmission date and contents

**Step 2.2: Update Letter #2 – Diagnostic Confirmation (Upon Receipt of Imaging)**
- [ ] Review imaging report with supervising attorney
- [ ] Draft interpretation letter translating medical findings into plain language
- [ ] **Causation Link**: Explicitly connect findings to collision ("high signal intensity consistent with acute, traumatic injury rather than chronic degeneration")
- [ ] Highlight structural injury findings that justify reserve increase
- [ ] Log transmission immediately upon sending

**Step 2.3: Update Letter #3 – Pre-Existing Preemption (1-2 Weeks After Diagnostic Confirmation)**
- [ ] Compile client's complete primary care records for 5-10 years pre-accident
- [ ] Draft cover letter explicitly stating absence of prior complaints
- [ ] **Key Language**: "As you will see, my client never once complained of [body part] pain, was never referred to a specialist, and was never prescribed pain medication for similar symptoms. This proves conclusively that the [injury] is a direct result of the collision..."
- [ ] Destroy pre-existing condition defense preemptively

**Step 2.4: Update Letter #4 – Synthesis & Prognosis (At MMI)**
- [ ] Obtain physician's comprehensive narrative report
- [ ] Verify report includes:
  - Causation opinion to reasonable medical certainty
  - Prognosis establishing permanency
  - Permanent partial disability rating (if applicable)
  - Future treatment recommendations
- [ ] Draft synthesis letter highlighting permanent impairment and future damages
- [ ] Calculate future medical costs for damages itemization

---

#### **PHASE 3: Final Demand Package**

**Step 3.1: Structure Final Demand Letter**
Include all seven required sections:

| Section | Content Requirements |
|---------|---------------------|
| **1. Introduction** | Settlement offer amount, time limit (typically 30 days) |
| **2. Liability Summary** | Consolidated fault evidence, citations, admissions |
| **3. Injury Summary** | Causation narrative linking injuries to collision |
| **4. Damages Itemization** | Table format: past medicals, future medicals, lost wages, pain/suffering |
| **5. Legal Analysis** | Bad faith warning, duty to tender notice, punitive exposure (if applicable) |
| **6. Settlement Conditions** | Financial affidavits, tax returns, release language, reliance statements |
| **7. Withdrawal Language** | Explicit deadline and consequences of non-response |

**Step 3.2: Draft Time-Limited Demand Elements**
- [ ] Set clear deadline (30 days standard)
- [ ] Specify acceptance requirements (payee designation, release form approval)
- [ ] State explicit consequences of non-response or rejection
- [ ] Include duty to tender notification language

**Step 3.3: Include Bad Faith Leverage (If Applicable)**
For cases with punitive exposure (DUI, egregious conduct):
- [ ] Educate adjuster on duty to protect vs. duty to indemnify
- [ ] Explain punitive damages non-coverage is irrelevant to settlement duty
- [ ] Reference criminal case guilty plea (collateral estoppel effect)
- [ ] Consider Hartford Letter for insurer-insured conflict creation

---

#### **PHASE 4: Red Flag Response & Escalation**

**Step 4.1: Monitor for Red Flags**
Watch for and document:
- [ ] Unresponsive adjuster (no response within 14 days)
- [ ] Lowball offer (below documented medical specials)
- [ ] Pre-existing condition argument after preemption letter sent
- [ ] Unreasonable delays or stalling tactics
- [ ] Failure to increase reserves despite documented injury progression

**Step 4.2: Execute Escalation Protocols**

| Red Flag | Protocol |
|----------|----------|
| **Unresponsive Adjuster** | 1) Contact claims management to verify status; 2) If chronic neglect, file suit to trigger reassignment to litigation adjuster; 3) Push for early mediation |
| **Lowball Offer** | 1) "Paper the file" with updated evidence (permanency statements, future care needs); 2) Request written justification for offer in light of documented record |
| **Pre-Existing Argument** | 1) Reference prior letter by date; 2) Point to specific records already provided; 3) Document adjuster's failure to review evidence |

---

#### **PHASE 5: Mediation Preparation (If Settlement Not Achieved)**

**Step 5.1: Prepare Mediation Statement (3-4 Weeks Before Mediation)**
- [ ] Compile complete case chronology
- [ ] Summarize all update letters and insurer responses
- [ ] Document reserve increase triggers provided
- [ ] Include bad faith record summary if applicable
- [ ] Draft professional, persuasive tone (empower mediator)

**Step 5.2: Organize Mediation Exhibits**
- [ ] Timeline of all communications with dates
- [ ] Evidence provided at each stage
- [ ] Adjuster responses and offer history
- [ ] Bad faith indicators documented

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] **Liability Confirmed**: Clear fault established before launching campaign
- [ ] **Damages Documentation**: All medical bills, lost wages, and future costs verified and itemized
- [ ] **Chronological Integrity**: All communications logged with dates, contents, and delivery confirmation
- [ ] **Causation Link**: Every medical finding explicitly connected to collision in writing
- [ ] **Pre-Existing Preemption**: Clean medical history documented and transmitted before diagnosis confirmation

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
| Situation | Escalation Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Adjuster disputes clear liability | Flag for attorney review of litigation timing |
| Settlement authority appears inadequate | Discuss filing suit to trigger reserve review |
| Bad faith indicators accumulating | Review bad faith claim viability with attorney |
| Client wants to accept low offer | Attorney must advise on full claim value |
| Complex causation issues | Attorney guidance on expert witness needs |
| Punitive damages potential | Attorney strategy session on Hartford Letter |

#### Do NOT:
- Provide legal advice or final legal conclusions
- Make settlement recommendations without attorney approval
- Commit to settlement terms without attorney authorization
- Advise on statute of limitations or legal deadlines
- Interpret insurance policy coverage provisions

## Quick Reference: Bad Faith Record Elements

For each communication, document:
1. **Date sent** (certified mail confirmation)
2. **Specific evidence transmitted** (document names, dates, findings)
3. **Strategic disclosures made** (duty to tender notice, causation opinions)
4. **Adjuster response** (offer amount, objections raised, or silence)
5. **Reserve increase trigger** (what justified higher valuation)

This record becomes the foundation for proving:
- What the insurer knew
- When they knew it
- Why their failure to tender was unreasonable
