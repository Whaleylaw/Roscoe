# Strategic Communication Methodology – The Update Letter Campaign

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Update Letter Campaign Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means:
- Insurance adjuster has received a methodical, time-stamped series of communications that progressively build the claim's reserve value
- A complete evidentiary record exists documenting exactly what the insurer knew and when they knew it
- The adjuster has been empowered with supervisor-ready documentation to justify reserve increases at each stage
- The case is positioned for either (a) a fair pre-suit settlement at full value, or (b) an unassailable bad faith claim if the insurer acts unreasonably
- All communications serve the dual purpose of settlement advancement AND bad faith record construction

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- Drafting the initial representation letter for a new personal injury case
- Planning the strategic sequencing of evidence releases to the insurance adjuster
- A client has completed a phase of medical treatment (ER visit, specialist evaluation, diagnostic imaging, MMI)
- Determining optimal timing for releasing medical evidence
- Preparing communications that must serve dual purposes (settlement facilitation + bad faith documentation)
- Reviewing a case's communication history for completeness
- Responding to adjuster tactics, lowball offers, or delays

---

### Inputs Required

| Input Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Client Information** | Name, DOB, contact information, claim number |
| **Insured Information** | At-fault party name, policy information, adjuster contact |
| **Liability Documentation** | Police crash report, photographs (vehicles, scene, injuries), property damage estimate/total loss letter |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **PHASE 1: Initial Representation Letter & Package**
*Timeline: Within 30 days of retention*

**Step 1.1: Gather Initial Documentation**
Collect and organize:
- [ ] Police crash report
- [ ] Photographs (vehicles, scene, visible injuries)
- [ ] Property damage estimate or total loss letter
- [ ] Emergency transport and ER records/bills
- [ ] Client's prior claims history letter (from their own auto insurer)

**Step 1.2: Draft Initial Transmittal Letter**
Structure the letter with these required paragraphs:

1. **Notice and Basic Facts**
   - Identify client, insured, date of loss, claim number
   - State representation status

2. **Liability Statement**
   - Reference enclosed police report and photos
   - State objective facts establishing fault (e.g., citations, admissions)

3. **Injury and Treatment Summary**
   - Describe immediate injuries documented in ER records
   - Summarize treatment received and current status

4. **Document Preview and Cooperation Statement**
   - List all enclosed documents
   - Frame provision as cooperative: *"I am enclosing this documentation to assist your company in fairly evaluating this claim and setting appropriate reserves."*

5. **Anticipated Future Documentation**
   - Build anticipation for next communication
   - Include specific dates if known (e.g., upcoming specialist appointments)

**Step 1.3: Log Communication**
Record in case file:
- Date sent
- Complete list of documents transmitted
- Method of delivery (certified mail, email, fax)

---

#### **PHASE 2: Update Letter #1 – Clinical Suspicion**
*Timeline: 60-90 days after initial letter*

**Step 2.1: Gather Clinical Evidence**
Collect:
- [ ] Treating physician records documenting persistent symptoms
- [ ] Clinical findings (positive provocative tests, neurological signs)
- [ ] Physician's order for advanced diagnostic testing (MRI, etc.)

**Step 2.2: Draft Clinical Suspicion Letter**
Key elements:
- Highlight concerning clinical findings
- Document physician's diagnostic orders
- **CRITICAL LANGUAGE** (must include): *"As soon as we receive the imaging report, I will promptly provide it to you, good, bad, or ugly..."*

**Step 2.3: Log Communication**
Record:
- Date sent
- Specific records transmitted
- The "good, bad, or ugly" promise made

---

#### **PHASE 3: Update Letter #2 – Diagnostic Confirmation**
*Timeline: Immediately upon receipt of imaging*

**Step 3.1: Prepare Imaging Interpretation**
- Obtain diagnostic imaging report (MRI, CT, etc.)
- Translate medical findings into lay language
- Identify findings indicating acute vs. degenerative changes

**Step 3.2: Draft Diagnostic Confirmation Letter**
Key elements:
- **Do NOT simply attach the report** – interpret findings for the adjuster
- Connect symptoms → clinical findings → imaging in a clear narrative
- Explicitly link findings to the collision
- Example language: *"The MRI reveals a disc herniation at C5-C6... Of particular significance, the radiologist notes high signal intensity within the disc space, a finding consistent with acute, traumatic injury rather than chronic degeneration, directly linking this injury to the collision."*

**Step 3.3: Log Communication**
Record:
- Date sent
- Specific imaging studies transmitted
- Key findings communicated

---

#### **PHASE 4: Update Letter #3 – Pre-Existing Condition Preemption**
*Timeline: 1-2 weeks after Diagnostic Confirmation*

**Step 4.1: Gather Pre-Accident Medical History**
Collect:
- [ ] Client's primary care records for 5-10 years prior to accident
- [ ] Any relevant specialist records from same period
- [ ] Documentation showing absence of similar complaints

**Step 4.2: Draft Pre-Existing Preemption Letter**
Key elements:
- Transmit complete prior medical history
- **Explicitly connect the dots**: *"As you will see from your review of these records, my client never once complained of [back/neck] pain, was never referred to a specialist, and was never prescribed pain medication for similar symptoms."*
- State causation conclusion: *"This comprehensive history proves conclusively that the herniated disc confirmed on the recent MRI is a direct result of the collision..."*

**Step 4.3: Log Communication**
Record:
- Date sent
- Date range of prior records transmitted
- Explicit causation argument made

---

#### **PHASE 5: Update Letter #4 – Synthesis & Prognosis**
*Timeline: After Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)*

**Step 5.1: Gather MMI Documentation**
Collect:
- [ ] Treating physician's comprehensive narrative report
- [ ] Causation opinion (to reasonable degree of medical certainty)
- [ ] Prognosis and permanency assessment
- [ ] Permanent partial disability rating (if provided)
- [ ] Future care recommendations

**Step 5.2: Draft Synthesis Letter**
Key elements:
- Synthesize all prior evidence into cohesive narrative
- Highlight from physician report:
  - Causation opinion
  - Permanency of injury
  - Disability rating
  - Future medical treatment recommendations (basis for future damages)
- Shift focus from diagnosis/causation to permanent impairment and future damages

**Step 5.3: Log Communication**
Record:
- Date sent
- Key conclusions from physician report
- Future care costs disclosed

---

#### **PHASE 6: Make Communications Software-Friendly**
*Apply to ALL letters*

**Step 6.1: Structure for Adjuster Software**
- Lead with strongest value drivers (top 60 factors)
- Include ICD-10/CPT codes next to each diagnosis and bill
- Create copy-and-paste ready bullet points for adjuster notes

**Step 6.2: Create Supervisor-Ready Summary**
- Include concise summary section in each letter
- Format for easy inclusion in reserve increase requests
- Anticipate supervisor questions and address proactively

---

#### **PHASE 7: Monitor and Respond**
*Ongoing throughout campaign*

**Step 7.1: Track Adjuster Responses**
Log:
- All verbal responses
- Written settlement offers
- Requests for extensions
- Periods of non-responsiveness
- Duty to tender notifications sent

**Step 7.2: Identify Red Flags and Escalate**

| Red Flag | Response Protocol |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Unresponsive Adjuster** | 1. Contact management to verify adjuster status. 2. If chronic neglect: file suit to trigger reassignment to litigation adjuster. 3. Push for early mediation. |
| **Lowball Offer (Below Medical Specials)** | 1. "Paper the file" with updated evidence on permanency/future care. 2. Request written justification from adjuster explaining how offer is justified given documented record. |
| **Pre-Existing Condition Argument (after Preemption Letter)** | 1. Reference prior correspondence by date. 2. Point to specific records disproving argument. 3. Document adjuster's failure to consider evidence. |

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] Every letter includes date, claim number, and specific document list
- [ ] All medical records are reviewed for accuracy before transmission
- [ ] ICD-10 and CPT codes are verified against source documents
- [ ] "Good, bad, or ugly" promise is included in Update Letter #1
- [ ] Prior medical history covers minimum 5 years (preferably 10)
- [ ] All communications are sent via traceable method (certified mail, email with read receipt)
- [ ] Communication log is updated within 24 hours of each transmission

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
- [ ] Adjuster disputes clear liability after police report provided
- [ ] Multiple failed attempts to contact adjuster (3+ attempts over 2 weeks)
- [ ] Settlement offer below documented medical specials
- [ ] Adjuster raises pre-existing condition defense after preemption letter sent
- [ ] Insurer misses duty to tender despite clear liability and damages exceeding limits
- [ ] Any hint of adjuster bad faith (e.g., misrepresenting policy terms)
- [ ] Statute of limitations approaching with no meaningful negotiation progress

#### Bad Faith Documentation Requirements
Ensure each letter creates a time-stamped record of:
- [ ] What information was provided
- [ ] When it was provided
- [ ] How it triggers or relates to duty to tender
- [ ] Adjuster's response (or lack thereof)

## Key Principles Summary

### The Paradigm Shift
- **From:** Adversary who hoards information ("Wyatt Earp" style)
- **To:** Facilitator who empowers adjusters to do the right thing

### Dual-Purpose Communications
Every letter serves TWO purposes:
1. **Settlement Advancement:** Make it easy for insurer to settle fairly
2. **Bad Faith Record:** Document what they knew and when

### The Reserve Stepladder
- Reserves increase incrementally, not in one jump
- Each update letter justifies the next step up
- Provide supervisor-ready summaries to facilitate approval

### Professional Credibility
- Firm but professional tone
- "Good, bad, or ugly" transparency
- Reputation asset across entire caseload
