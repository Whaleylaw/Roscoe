# Understanding Insurance Company Operations & Adjuster Psychology

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Insurance Intelligence & Strategic Negotiation Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successfully leverage internal insurance company mechanics—reserves, authority hierarchies, automated valuation systems, and timing pressures—to craft communications and evidence packages that facilitate fair settlements by providing adjusters with documented, credible proof they need to justify increasing a claim's value within their organizational hierarchy.

---

### When to Use
- **New claim initiated**: To establish baseline understanding of the negotiation landscape
- **Preparing any communication to an adjuster**: To frame messaging strategically
- **Analyzing why an offer is low**: To identify systemic undervaluation or authority ceilings
- **Timing settlement demands**: To leverage fiscal calendar pressures (quarter-end, year-end)
- **Structuring demand packages**: To optimize for automated valuation systems (Colossus, ClaimIQ)
- **Encountering adjuster non-responsiveness**: To determine if escalation is warranted

---

### Inputs Required
1. **Policy Information**
   - Policy limits and all applicable endorsements
   - Carrier name and specific claim handling unit

2. **Claim Intelligence**
   - Current reserve levels (if available/discoverable)
   - Assigned adjuster name and contact information
   - Adjuster's authority tier (if known)
   - Automated valuation system in use (Colossus, ClaimIQ, Claims Outcome Advisor)

3. **Case Documentation**
   - All medical records with diagnoses (ICD-10 codes)
   - Medical bills with procedure codes (CPT codes)
   - Wage loss documentation
   - Evidence of liability (police reports, citations, witness statements)
   - Documentation of functional limitations
   - Psychological evaluations with standardized scores (PCL-5, PHQ-9, GAD-7)

4. **Strategic Context**
   - Current stage of negotiation
   - Prior offers and counteroffers
   - Any previous adjuster communications
   - Calendar proximity to quarter/year-end

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering & Reserve Strategy**

**Step 1.1 — Identify the Carrier's Valuation System**
- Determine which automated system the carrier uses (Colossus, ClaimIQ, Claims Outcome Advisor)
- Note data entry constraints: ~60 value drivers, ~7 diagnoses typically entered
- Understand the system's documented 12-20% undervaluation calibration

**Step 1.2 — Map the Authority Hierarchy**
- Research or estimate adjuster's authority tier:
  - Junior adjusters: ~$15,000
  - Senior adjusters: ~$50,000-$100,000
  - Home office/committee: Policy limits+
- Note that litigation adjusters have higher authority than pre-suit adjusters

**Step 1.3 — Assess Current Reserve Status**
- If reserve information is available, record it
- Understand that low initial reserves create anchoring bias
- Recognize that reserve increases require supervisor justification

---

#### **Phase 2: Value Driver Extraction & Prioritization**

**Step 2.1 — Extract All Potential Value Drivers**
Systematically identify and document:

| Category | Data Points to Capture |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Statutory Violations** | Traffic citations, negligence per se factors |
| **Aggravated Conduct** | DUI/DWI, reckless behavior, punitive exposure |
| **Scars/Disfigurement** | Location-specific (facial, visible extremities), keloid formation |
| **Objective Pain Indicators** | BP spikes in records, pain scale charting consistency |
| **Functional Loss** | Specific activities now performed "under duress" with pain |
| **Psychological Injuries** | PTSD, anxiety, depression with DSM-5/ICD-10 codes and standardized scores |
| **Permanency Factors** | Impairment ratings, future care needs, life expectancy impact |

**Step 2.2 — Rank and Sequence Value Drivers**
- Prioritize the top 60 value drivers by severity and impact score
- Sequence list with highest-impact factors first to guarantee system capture
- Ensure strongest factors appear in the first portion of any demand package

---

#### **Phase 3: Demand Package Engineering**

**Step 3.1 — Structure for Automated System Optimization**
Format the demand package to:
- Place strongest 60 value drivers first in the document
- Use bold subheadings for each value driver category
- Create short, copy-and-paste-ready bullet points
- Place ICD-10/CPT codes directly adjacent to each diagnosis and bill
- Minimize need for adjuster interpretation or transcription

**Step 3.2 — Apply the Strategic Stepladder Method**
| Phase | Action | Timing |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Initial Submission** | Send key liability and injury evidence | Within 30 days of representation |
| **Reserve Building** | Submit surgical reports, impairment ratings, wage loss | As obtained |
| **Guided Increases** | Provide new documented information for each reserve rung | Strategic intervals |
| **Final Demand** | Comprehensive package building on established reserve | When treatment stabilizes |

**Step 3.3 — Leverage Calendar Pressure Points**
- Target Q4 (October-December) for renewed settlement discussions
- Prioritize Thanksgiving and Christmas windows for close-out pressure
- Note quarter-end dates as secondary pressure points

---

#### **Phase 4: Adjuster Communication Strategy**

**Step 4.1 — Facilitate, Don't Antagonize**
- Frame communications as helping the adjuster justify fair value internally
- Provide the documented proof adjusters need for supervisor presentations
- Transform the adjuster from gatekeeper to internal advocate

**Step 4.2 — Address Adjuster Constraints**
- Recognize workload pressures (50-100 files/month)
- Compensate for limited medical/legal training with clear explanations
- Make your submission the easiest file on their desk to process correctly

---

#### **Phase 5: Red Flag Monitoring & Escalation**

**Step 5.1 — Monitor for Systematic Undervaluation**
- **Indicator**: Offer less than documented medical specials
- **Response**: 
  1. Obtain updated physician statements on permanency
  2. Request written explanation of offer justification
  3. Paper the file to force supervisor review

**Step 5.2 — Detect Authority Ceiling Issues**
- **Indicators**: Chronic non-responsiveness, refusal to negotiate despite new evidence
- **Response**:
  1. Contact management to verify adjuster status
  2. Consider filing suit to trigger reassignment to litigation adjuster with higher authority

**Step 5.3 — Identify Non-Colossus Catastrophic Cases**
- **Categories requiring human review**:
  - Death
  - Major burns
  - Spinal cord injury / TBI
  - Paralysis
  - CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome)
- **Response**: Explicitly state in demand that case requires human-level review

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All policy limits and endorsements verified before demand formulation
- [ ] Value drivers ranked and top 60 identified
- [ ] ICD-10/CPT codes placed adjacent to all diagnoses and bills
- [ ] Demand package formatted for automated system data entry
- [ ] Reserve increase strategy documented (stepladder approach)
- [ ] Calendar timing considered (quarter/year-end proximity)
- [ ] Authority tier estimated and demand calibrated accordingly

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
- Offer below documented medical specials
- Adjuster non-responsiveness after significant new evidence submitted
- Catastrophic injury requiring human valuation escalation
- Bad faith indicators (unreasonable delay, denial without explanation)
- Policy limits demand situation (triggers duty to settle analysis)

#### Do NOT Provide
- Legal conclusions on bad faith liability
- Final settlement recommendations
- Advice to file suit vs. continue negotiation
- Assessment of litigation merit

Reference:
- You have been trained on the "Understanding Insurance Company Operations & Adjuster Psychology" report, which defines the internal mechanics of insurance claim handling, adjuster constraints, automated valuation systems, reserve dynamics, authority hierarchies, and strategic timing for settlement negotiations.

Task:
- {{Describe the specific task, e.g., "Analyze this case file and produce an insurance intelligence summary with value driver extraction optimized for the carrier's valuation system." OR "Review the current negotiation status and identify red flags indicating systematic undervaluation or authority ceiling issues." OR "Structure the demand package to optimize for Colossus data entry constraints and recommend strategic timing."}}

Inputs:
- Client: {{client_name}}
- Case context: {{case_context, e.g., "Motor vehicle collision, rear-end impact, client sustained cervical disc herniation with surgical recommendation"}}
- Carrier: {{insurance_carrier}}
- Policy limits: {{policy_limits}}
- Current reserve (if known): {{current_reserve}}
- Adjuster: {{adjuster_name_and_contact}}
- Documents or data: {{uploaded_documents_or_data, e.g., "Medical records (3 providers), police report, wage loss documentation, prior adjuster correspondence"}}
