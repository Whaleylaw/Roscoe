# Insurance Company Corporate Depositions (30.02(6)) — AI Paralegal Module

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Insurance Company 30.02(6) Corporate Deposition Preparation**

---

### Goal
Successfully prepare a comprehensive 30.02(6) deposition notice, examination outline, and supporting document requests that will:
1. Compel binding corporate testimony on claims handling standards
2. Establish the insurer's knowledge of Kentucky UCSPA obligations
3. Pinpoint when liability became "reasonably clear" to trigger settlement duties
4. Uncover internal rationale, reserve practices, and incentive structures that reveal institutional bad faith

**Success looks like:** A complete deposition package (notice, document requests, examination outline) that strategically traps the corporate designee into either adopting problematic adjuster conduct as official policy OR admitting policy violations—while preserving all testimony as binding on the corporation.

---

### When to Use

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Insurance bad faith case involving claim denial, delay, or underpayment
- Need to obtain binding corporate admissions (not just individual adjuster testimony)
- Supervising attorney requests preparation of corporate deposition materials
- Case involves potential violations of Kentucky Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (UCSPA)
- Need to neutralize anticipated "rogue adjuster" defense
- Pre-trial discovery phase where corporate policies and practices are relevant

**Do NOT use when:**
- Deposing individual witnesses only (use standard deposition protocols)
- Jurisdiction does not follow similar corporate deposition rules
- Case does not involve insurance bad faith claims

---

### Inputs Required

| Input | Description | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Client Name & Case Caption** | Full party names, case number, court | Required |
| **Insurance Company Name** | Defendant insurer to be deposed | Required |
| **Claim File Documents** | Complete claims file if already produced | Required if available |
| **Prior Discovery** | Interrogatory answers, prior depositions | Recommended |
| **Case Chronology** | Timeline of claim events and key dates | Required |
| **Coverage Documents** | Policy declarations, coverage limits | Required |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Case Analysis & Strategic Planning**

**Step 1.1 — Review Case Foundation**
- Review all available claim file documentation
- Identify the chronological timeline of:
  - Date of loss/incident
  - Date claim reported
  - All adjuster contacts and evaluations
  - All settlement offers and demands
  - Current claim status
- Flag gaps in documentation that suggest missing records

**Step 1.2 — Identify "Reasonably Clear" Liability Date**
- Analyze claim file for the point when liability evidence overwhelmingly favored the claimant
- Look for adjuster notes, supervisor comments, or internal memos acknowledging liability
- Document this date precisely—it triggers the duty to settle under UCSPA

**Step 1.3 — Map Reserve History**
- If available, chart reserve amounts over time
- Note any reserve increases/decreases and corresponding events
- Compare reserves to settlement authority levels assigned to adjusters
- Flag disconnects between reserves and settlement offers

**Step 1.4 — Identify Bad Faith Themes**
Based on case facts, select primary bad faith themes to emphasize:
- [ ] Failure to investigate fully and fairly
- [ ] Lowball offers despite reasonably clear liability
- [ ] Unreasonable delay tactics
- [ ] Failure to reevaluate claim as new evidence emerged
- [ ] Gap between reserves and settlement authority
- [ ] Incentive structures encouraging claim underpayment
- [ ] Failure to comply with UCSPA requirements

---

#### **Phase 3: Draft Examination Outline**

**Step 3.1 — Foundation Questions (Must Begin Here)**
Draft questions to lock in designee authority and preparation:
```
1. Are you the person designated by [COMPANY] to speak on their behalf regarding all topics in the notice?
2. Do you understand [COMPANY] is required to prepare you to provide all information known or reasonably available to the company?
3. Are you aware your answers will be binding upon [COMPANY]?
4. What did you do to gather knowledge on all topics in the notice?
5. Did you review the complete claim file?
6. Did you review claims handling guidelines in effect during this claim?
7. Did you speak with adjusters, supervisors, or other personnel who handled this claim?
```

**Step 3.2 — UCSPA Compliance Questions**
Draft questions establishing knowledge of legal duties:
```
1. Does [COMPANY] train employees that insurers handling Kentucky claims must comply with the UCSPA?
2. Does [COMPANY] train employees on the specific requirements of the UCSPA?
3. Does [COMPANY] have written policies implementing UCSPA requirements?
```

**Step 3.3 — Good Faith Standards Questions**
Draft questions on internal claims handling standards:
```
1. Does [COMPANY] train adjusters to investigate claims fully and fairly?
2. Does that mean looking for facts favoring payment, not just denial?
3. Does [COMPANY] train employees that adjusters have a continuing duty to reevaluate?
4. Does [COMPANY] train employees they cannot lowball claimants to save money?
5. Does [COMPANY] require documentation of all significant acts on a claim?
```

**Step 3.4 — Reserve and Authority Questions**
Draft questions exposing valuation/authority disconnects:
```
1. Explain [COMPANY]'s reserve setting policies and procedures.
2. What is the purpose of reserves?
3. What was the initial reserve on this claim? On what date?
4. Did the reserve change? When and why?
5. What was the settlement authority level of each adjuster on this claim?
6. Was there ever a gap between the reserve and the adjuster's authority?
```

**Step 3.5 — Incentive Structure Questions**
Draft questions uncovering financial motives:
```
1. Does [COMPANY] have bonus or incentive plans for claims personnel?
2. What are the criteria for earning bonuses?
3. Are indemnity payments a factor in calculating bonuses?
4. Are there metrics tracking average indemnity payments by adjuster or unit?
5. Are adjusters evaluated based on claim outcomes affecting company profitability?
```

**Step 3.6 — Capstone Questions (Case-Specific)**
Draft closing questions forcing the "commitment-consistency trap":
```
1. Was this claim handled consistent with [COMPANY]'s policies and procedures?
2. Was this claim handled the same way [COMPANY] handles every claim?
3. At what point did [COMPANY] conclude liability was reasonably clear?
4. What did [COMPANY] do after that determination to effectuate a prompt, fair settlement?
```

#### **Phase 4: Cross-Reference Documentary Evidence**

**Step 4.1 — Create Exhibit Strategy**
For each examination section, identify:
- Specific documents to use as exhibits
- Page/entry references for key admissions
- Timeline entries to confront evasive answers

**Step 4.2 — Prepare Impeachment Materials**
Organize:
- Claim file entries contradicting expected testimony
- Training materials establishing standards
- Reserve history showing evaluation evolution
- Prior inconsistent statements from discovery

---

#### **Phase 5: Quality Assurance & Attorney Review**

**Step 5.1 — Completeness Check**
Verify all required elements are included:
- [ ] Notice complies with CR 30.02(6) format requirements
- [ ] All critical topics are covered
- [ ] Document requests are comprehensive
- [ ] Examination outline is logically sequenced
- [ ] Foundation questions precede substantive examination
- [ ] Case-specific facts are accurately incorporated

**Step 5.2 — Prepare Attorney Summary**
Create brief summary highlighting:

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### **Validation Checks**

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Topic Specificity | Each topic is described with "reasonable particularity" per CR 30.02(6) |
| Binding Nature Established | Foundation questions confirm designee understands testimony binds corporation |
| Legal Standards Cited | Questions reference UCSPA and Kentucky law accurately |
| Timeline Accuracy | All dates and events verified against case documents |
| Document-to-Topic Mapping | Each document request corresponds to examination topics |

#### **Red Flags to Note for Attorney**

| Red Flag | Significance | Action |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| Unprepared designee anticipated | Witness likely to claim ignorance despite preparation duty | Prepare motion to compel/sanctions template citing *U.S. v. Taylor* |
| Missing claim file documents | Gaps suggest withholding or spoliation | Note for spoliation motion if documents not produced |
| Reserve-authority disconnect | High reserves but low adjuster authority indicates institutional bad faith | Emphasize in examination outline |
| Erratic reserve changes | Arbitrary valuation suggests bad faith evaluation | Timeline analysis for attorney |
| Incentive structure tied to indemnity | Direct financial motive to underpay | Priority examination topic |

#### **Escalation Triggers**

Immediately flag for supervising attorney when:
1. **Discovery indicates potential fraud** — Evidence of fabricated documentation or destroyed files
2. **Privilege issues arise** — Documents may contain attorney-client communications requiring in camera review
3. **Sanctions warranted** — Prior unprepared designee or discovery failures
4. **Settlement value reassessment needed** — Evidence significantly strengthens/weakens case
5. **Ethical concerns** — Any situation implicating professional responsibility rules
