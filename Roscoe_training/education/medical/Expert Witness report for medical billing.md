Expert Witness Report: Methodology for Evaluating the Reasonableness of Medical Charges

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.0 Introduction and Statement of Purpose

This report details the systematic, data-driven methodology I use to evaluate the reasonableness of medical charges in personal injury litigation. This methodology provides an objective and reliable foundation for my opinion, as it is firmly grounded in federally regulated data standards and industry-accepted data sources. This ensures a rigorous and defensible evaluation that is independent of any single party's perspective.

The scope of this report is to detail the core principles, analytical processes, and authoritative data sources that form the basis of my expert opinion on the reasonable value of medical services. I will explain how standardized coding, national pricing databases, and a multi-step audit process are integrated to produce a sound and reproducible conclusion. This report will begin by establishing the foundational principles of the U.S. medical billing system, which make such an objective analysis possible.

2.0 The Federally Regulated Framework of U.S. Medical Billing

A strategic understanding of the standardized nature of U.S. medical billing is essential for any credible analysis of healthcare charges. Federal regulations, particularly the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), have created a uniform system of codes and identifiers. This standardization transforms what might otherwise be subjective billing practices into a quantifiable and comparable data ecosystem, enabling an objective, data-based analysis of the reasonableness of charges across different providers and geographic locations.

Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) Codes

Designated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under HIPAA, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes serve as the national standard for describing medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. These five-digit numerical codes function as a universal language for healthcare services, ensuring a common and precise understanding among patients, providers, payers, and government agencies. This system allows for the aggregation and comparison of charges for the exact same procedure, regardless of where or by whom it was performed.

The National Provider Identifier (NPI)

The National Provider Identifier (NPI) is a unique 10-digit identification number for healthcare providers, also required by HIPAA. Every individual provider, clinic, and hospital uses its NPI for administrative and billing purposes. This universal identifier improves the efficiency of electronic healthcare transactions and is a critical tool in reducing fraud and abuse. For data analysis, the NPI ensures that charge data can be accurately attributed to a specific provider while being aggregated anonymously for market analysis, in compliance with federal antitrust regulations.

The Function of a Healthcare Clearinghouse

A Healthcare Clearinghouse acts as an essential intermediary that facilitates the electronic transmission of claims between healthcare providers and insurance payers. Its role is to ensure claims are processed accurately, compliantly, and efficiently. The key functions of a clearinghouse include:

\* Claims Processing: Reviewing and "scrubbing" claims to check for errors and ensure compliance with payer requirements. This includes validating codes and standardizing claims into a universal format compatible with different payer systems.  
\* Transmission: Using secure Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) to transmit claims, which streamlines the billing process and accelerates payment cycles.  
\* Tracking and Reporting: Providing providers with real-time status updates on submitted claims and offering detailed analytics on submissions, rejections, and payments to help improve billing practices.  
\* Compliance: Ensuring all transmitted data adheres to regulatory standards like HIPAA, thereby safeguarding protected health information.

Together, these federally mandated components—CPT codes, NPI numbers, and clearinghouses—create an ecosystem where vast amounts of medical billing data are standardized, aggregated, and made available for systematic analysis. This regulated data framework is the foundation upon which an objective methodology for determining the reasonableness of medical charges is built, a determination that is a critical requirement under the law.

3.0 The Legal Standard of "Reasonableness" for Medical Expenses

My methodology operates within a critical legal context established by courts across the country. In personal injury cases, a plaintiff's recovery for medical expenses is not automatically the amount billed by the provider. Instead, recovery is limited to the reasonable value of the necessary medical services provided. This principle is firmly established in case law to prevent plaintiffs from being reimbursed for costs that were never actually incurred, as providers frequently accept reduced payments from other payors as payment in full.

Legal principles derived from Arizona case law, which reflect a widely held judicial standard, articulate this requirement with clarity:

\* A plaintiff's recovery is limited to the reasonable amount of medical expenses, which must be both reasonable and necessary.  
\* The mere existence of medical bills is not sufficient evidence of their own reasonableness; other evidence must be offered to establish this.  
\* Billed charges are not the equivalent of "usual and customary charges," as providers often accept reduced payments from other payors as payment in full.  
\* The reasonable value of services is best measured by the overall rate of payment accepted from other payors for the same services.

This legal requirement is widespread, with at least forty-six (46) other jurisdictions reflecting this standard that a plaintiff's medical expenses must be proven reasonable to be recoverable as damages. The legal necessity of establishing reasonableness is therefore the direct impetus for a formal, expert-driven methodology designed to determine it.

4.0 The Three-Pronged Methodology for Evaluating Reasonable Value

To meet the legal standard of reasonableness, I employ a multi-step, three-pronged analytical framework to audit charges and determine the reasonable value of medical services. My process ensures a thorough evaluation by combining a technical coding audit, a geographic market-price comparison, and a final market validation to arrive at a well-supported and objective opinion.

Prong 1: Technical Audit of Medical Billing and Coding

In the first prong of my methodology, I conduct a detailed audit of each medical charge to ensure it complies with applicable medical billing rules, standards, and federal regulations. This technical review verifies that the services were coded and billed correctly according to established industry guidelines. My audit process is tailored to the specific category of care:

\* Professional Services:  
  \* I audit these charges using CPT coding rules, validating the use of modifiers, checking for bundling/unbundling errors against National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits, and applying American Medical Association (AMA) guidelines.  
\* Anesthesia Services:  
  \* I audit these services based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists' standard formula, which calculates value based on a combination of Base units, Time units, and Modifying units.  
\* Inpatient Facility Services:  
  \* I audit these services based on the Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) assigned by the hospital. My analysis includes the DRG code, length of stay, discharge status, total charges, and the hospital-specific wage index for geographic precision, and I validate the results against data from the American Hospital Directory.  
\* Outpatient Facility Services:  
  \* I audit these services using CPT and Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) codes. I benchmark values against national Usual, Customary, and Reasonable (UCR) data from sources like Find-A-Code and Context4Reference, with adjustments made for the provider's specific geographic location.  
\* Pharmaceutical Services:  
  \* I audit these charges based on the National Drug Code (NDC). I determine the Usual and Customary value using the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) from authoritative sources such as the IBM Micromedex RED BOOK.  
\* Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS):  
  \* I audit these charges using the HCPCS coding system. I then compare the charges against state-specific DMEPOS fee schedules and national UCR values.

Prong 2: Geographic-Specific Pricing Analysis

In the second prong of my methodology, I determine the reasonable marketplace value for the audited services within the same geographic community and for the same year the services were rendered. Using the validated CPT code, date of service, and the provider's zip code as inputs, I query national databases to establish a market benchmark. The output of this analysis provides the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile charged amounts for that specific procedure, in that specific geographic region, at that time. This provides an objective comparison of the provider's billed charge against the prevailing market rates.

Prong 3: Local Market Analysis and Validation

The final prong of my methodology is a validation step. Here, I use local, publicly available resources, combined with my direct experience in medical billing and coding, to cross-reference and confirm the reasonable value determined in the second prong. This step ensures that the data-driven conclusions from the national databases align with local market realities, adding a final layer of accuracy and validation to my opinion.

This three-pronged approach creates a rigorous, reproducible, and defensible opinion on the reasonable value of medical services, establishing a foundation that meets the highest standards for admissibility in court.

5.0 Foundational Reliability and Admissibility Under the Daubert Standard

For expert testimony to be admissible in court, it must be proven reliable under the standard set forth in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals and codified in the Federal Rules of Evidence. The three-pronged methodology I have described is explicitly designed to meet these stringent requirements for reliability and relevance.

Compliance with Fed. R. Evid. 702

Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that expert testimony must be based on sufficient facts or data, be the product of reliable principles and methods, and reflect a reliable application of those methods to the facts of the case. My methodology satisfies this standard by:

1\. Beginning with sufficient facts: My analysis is founded upon the patient's actual medical records and bills.  
2\. Using reliable methods: I apply standardized, industry-wide coding rules (CPT, DRG, etc.) and then compare this information to vast, aggregated datasets of charges for identical services.  
3\. Applying methods reliably: My process consistently compares a specific provider's charge to the charges of all physicians in a defined geographic area for the same service during the same time period.

Basis of Opinion under Fed. R. Evid. 703

Federal Rule of Evidence 703 permits an expert to base an opinion on facts or data that experts in their particular field would reasonably rely on. The nationally published databases I use in my methodology are precisely these kinds of sources. They are the same data repositories reasonably relied upon by hospitals, clinics, and other stakeholders across the healthcare industry for market analysis and pricing decisions.

Use of Nationally Recognized and Industry-Accepted Data Sources

The opinions I generate through this methodology are supported by nationally published databases that have been used and accepted in the healthcare industry for decades. These authoritative sources include:

\* PMIC Medical Fees  
\* Wasserman's Physicians Fee Reference  
\* Optum's National Fee Analyzer  
\* Context4Healthcare  
\* Find-A-Code  
\* American Hospital Directory  
\* IBM Micromedex RED BOOK

The reliability of these databases is underscored by their widespread use among hospitals, clinics, universities, and government entities. Furthermore, the data itself is captured through a federally regulated process that uses NPI numbers on all medical bills. This ensures the data is comprehensive and collected in a manner that complies with Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission antitrust regulations prohibiting anti-competitive price-sharing.

My methodology's adherence to Rules 702 and 703, combined with its reliance on verifiable, industry-standard data, establishes it as a sound and reliable basis for expert testimony.

6.0 Analysis of Related Legal Considerations

A robust expert methodology must not only be technically sound but also capable of withstanding common legal challenges raised during litigation. My methodology has been structured to account for and operate correctly within established evidentiary rules, including the collateral source rule and questions regarding the use of percentile benchmarks.

The Collateral Source Rule

The collateral source rule exists to prevent a jury from reducing a defendant's liability by considering payments a plaintiff received from an independent source, such as health insurance. My methodology does not violate this rule. As affirmed in cases like Cameron v. Lowes Home Centers Inc., my expert opinion is not derived from a collateral source (i.e., it does not consider what insurance paid). Instead, my opinion is grounded in industry principles and broad market data used to determine the reasonable and customary value of the medical expenses themselves. Cases sometimes cited to challenge this approach, such as Lopez, are often distinguishable because they involved a stipulation by the defendant that the billed amounts were reasonable—a fact not present when an expert is engaged specifically to determine reasonableness.

Justification for Percentile Benchmarks

A potential argument may arise that using a benchmark, such as the 75th or 90th percentile, is an arbitrary choice. This is a misunderstanding of the process. My use of established percentiles derived from comprehensive, geographic-specific charge data is a data-driven method for identifying statistical outliers. It is not an arbitrary selection but a standard statistical tool used to determine what the vast majority of providers in a specific market are charging for a given service. A charge that falls significantly above a high-end percentile like the 90th is, by definition, an outlier when compared to the prevailing market rates.

This methodology is therefore not only technically sound but also legally robust, having been structured to provide a relevant and permissible analysis under established rules of evidence.

7.0 Conclusion

This report has detailed the comprehensive methodology I use for determining the reasonable value of medical services in a manner that is systematic, objective, and legally defensible. My analysis is built upon a foundation of federally standardized data and relies on widely accepted industry practices and resources.

In summary, the three-pronged methodology I employ is:

\* Systematic and Reproducible: It follows a clear, three-step process of a technical coding audit, a geographic pricing analysis using national databases, and a final local market validation.  
\* Objective and Data-Driven: It relies on the federally regulated coding systems that govern U.S. healthcare and is benchmarked against extensive, industry-accepted national databases containing millions of real-world charge data points.  
\* Legally Defensible: It is designed to satisfy the strict reliability requirements for expert testimony under the Daubert standard and the Federal Rules of Evidence, and it operates properly within the bounds of other key legal doctrines like the collateral source rule.

This methodology provides a reliable and well-founded basis for my expert opinion on the reasonable value of medical services rendered in this case.
