# **An Introductory Guide to Common "Garbage" Objections in Legal Discovery**

### **1.0 Introduction: What Are "Garbage" Objections?**

In any lawsuit, the pre-trial "discovery" phase is a battle for information. Through formal requests, each side seeks evidence from the other to build its case. However, this process is often ground zero for tactical warfare, where an opponent may try to obstruct the flow of information using improper or unmeritorious arguments. These are commonly known as **"garbage objections"**—baseless claims used as weapons to delay a case, increase costs, or hide unfavorable facts. This guide serves as a primer on recognizing and countering these adversarial tactics, breaking down the most common objections into clear, understandable categories so you can be prepared for the fight.

### **2.0 Common Objections Grouped by Theme**

While there are many specific objections, they can be understood more easily when grouped into common themes. We will now explore these themes one by one.

#### **2.1 Objections About Clarity and Phrasing**

This first group of objections focuses on the discovery request itself, claiming it is poorly written, confusing, or improperly structured.

* **Unintelligible / Vague / Ambiguous / Uncertainty (aka "I Have Forgotten How to Use the English Language")** This is an objection claiming that the request is so poorly worded or unclear that the responding party cannot reasonably understand what information is being asked for.  
* **Compound / Conjunctive / Disjunctive** This objection is used when a single request improperly combines multiple, distinct questions into one, making it difficult to answer concisely and accurately.

#### **2.2 Objections About Scope and Relevance**

These objections argue that the request asks for too much information or for information that is not sufficiently related to the legal issues in the case.

* **"Fishing Expedition" (aka Overbroad)** This classic objection claims that the request is not a targeted search for specific evidence but rather a broad, unfocused attempt to sift through information in the hopes of finding something useful.  
* **Overbroad as to Time** This is a more specific version of the overbroad objection, arguing that the request asks for information from an unreasonably long or irrelevant period.  
* **Irrelevant / Inadmissible** This objection argues that the requested information has no logical connection to the issues in the case or that it would not be allowed as evidence if the case went to trial.

#### **2.3 Objections About Confidentiality and Privilege**

Some types of information are legally protected from disclosure. These objections claim that such a protection applies, though they are sometimes asserted improperly to hide non-protected information.

* **Assertion of Privileges (e.g., Attorney-Client / Work-Product)** This powerful objection claims the information is protected because it involves confidential communications with an attorney (attorney-client privilege) or was prepared specifically for litigation (work-product doctrine). To be valid, the responding party must typically provide a "privilege log" that identifies the documents being withheld so the requesting party can evaluate the merits of the privilege claim without seeing the confidential content.  
* **"Confidential" or "Proprietary Information" / Trade Secret** This objection is a claim that the information contains sensitive business data, such as trade secrets, financial records, or other proprietary material that could harm the company if disclosed.  
* **Third-Party Privacy Rights / Corporations Asserting Privacy Right** This objection is based on the argument that providing the requested information would violate the privacy rights of people or even corporations who are not directly involved in the lawsuit.

#### **2.4 Objections About Effort and Accessibility**

This final category of objections focuses on the supposed difficulty, expense, or burden of providing the requested information.

* **Burdensome and Oppressive** This objection claims that the effort required to find, review, and produce the requested information would be unreasonable in terms of time, expense, or labor.  
* **"Equally Available" to Propounding Party** This is an objection where the responding party argues they should not have to produce the information because the requesting party can obtain it just as easily from another source, such as public records.

### **3.0 Summary Table of Common Objections**

This table provides a quick reference guide to the core idea behind each category of common objections.

| Objection Category | Core Idea in Plain English |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Clarity and Phrasing** | "The request is confusingly written or structured." |
| **Scope and Relevance** | "The request asks for too much or irrelevant information." |
| **Confidentiality and Privilege** | "The information is legally protected from disclosure." |
| **Effort and Accessibility** | "Providing this information is too difficult or unfair." |

### **4.0 Conclusion: Why Recognizing These Objections Matters**

Recognizing a garbage objection is not an endpoint; it is the first step in a powerful process to gain control of a lawsuit. These objections are rarely about genuine confusion or concern—they are tactical moves designed to exhaust your resources and conceal the truth. Overcoming them is not just about getting a document; it is about creating **leverage** that can fundamentally alter the course of the case.

The process for dismantling a garbage objection follows a clear path.

1. It begins with a **"meet and confer"** letter, an official communication explaining why the objection is invalid and demanding a proper response.  
2. If the other side refuses to comply, you escalate by filing a **"motion to compel"** with the court. This asks a judge to intervene.  
3. A successful motion results in a court **order** compelling the other party to respond.  
4. It is the violation of this judicial order that unlocks the most powerful tools in discovery: **sanctions**. These penalties can range from monetary fines to having crucial evidence excluded at trial.

This progression—from objection, to motion, to court order, to the threat of sanctions—is how you generate the leverage needed to force cooperation, encourage settlement, and ultimately win the discovery battle to help win the war.
