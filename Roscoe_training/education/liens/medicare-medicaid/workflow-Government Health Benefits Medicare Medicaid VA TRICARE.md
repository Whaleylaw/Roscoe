# Government Health Benefits Lien Resolution

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Government Health Benefits Lien Identification & Resolution Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successfully identify, track, dispute, and resolve all government health benefit liens (Medicare, Medicaid, VA, TRICARE) while preserving client eligibility for needs-based programs and protecting the firm from statutory liability exposure.

---

### When to Use
- **At Case Intake:** Screen every new client for government health benefit status
- **During Case Evaluation:** When assessing total lien exposure and net recovery projections
- **Pre-Settlement:** When preparing settlement calculations and disbursement sheets
- **At Settlement:** When resolving liens and structuring distributions
- **Post-Settlement:** When implementing eligibility preservation strategies (trusts, spend-downs)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Client is age 65 or older
- Client receives Social Security Disability benefits
- Client mentions Medicare, Medicaid, VA, or TRICARE coverage
- Client is an active/retired military member or dependent
- Client has low income or receives public assistance
- Client will turn 65 during case pendency
- Settlement involves future medical care needs

---

### Inputs Required

| Input | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Client Demographics | Age, DOB, SSN/last 4 | Intake form |
| Health Insurance Information | Medicare/Medicaid/VA/TRICARE status | Client interview, insurance cards |
| Medicare Identifiers | HICN or MBI number | Medicare card, SSA records |
| State Medicaid Program | Program name and state | Client interview |
| Injury Date | Date of accident/incident | Case file |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Lien Identification (At Intake)**

**Step 1.1: Government Benefit Screening**
Complete the following checklist for every new client:

- [ ] Is the client currently a Medicare beneficiary?
- [ ] Is the client reasonably expected to become Medicare-eligible within 30 months?
  - Age approaching 65?
  - Receiving or applying for SSD benefits?
  - Potential for "back award" of disability benefits?
- [ ] Is the client a current Medicaid recipient?
  - If yes, identify the specific state program
- [ ] Is the client a veteran who has/may receive VA treatment for these injuries?
- [ ] Is the client or family member covered by TRICARE (active/retired military)?

**Step 1.2: Document Benefit Status**
- Record all government benefit identifiers in the case management system
- Note any anticipated changes in status during case pendency
- Flag cases requiring special monitoring (approaching 65, pending disability)

---

#### **Phase 2: Medicare Conditional Payment Resolution**

**Step 2.1: Report the Case to BCRC**
- Access the Medicare Secondary Payer Recovery Portal (MSPRP)
- Register the case immediately upon confirming Medicare beneficiary status
- Document case ID and registration date

**Step 2.2: Request Conditional Payment Letter (CPL)**
- Submit CPL request through the online portal
- Timeline: Request initial CPL within 30 days of case reporting
- Document receipt date and total claimed amount

**Step 2.3: Audit and Dispute Unrelated Charges**
- Review each line item against:
  - Date of injury
  - Body parts involved
  - Nature of treatment
- Flag and dispute charges for:
  - Pre-existing conditions unrelated to injury
  - Treatment dates outside the relevant period
  - Providers/facilities not treating the injury
- Submit formal disputes through the portal with supporting documentation
- Track dispute status and outcomes

**Step 2.4: Identify Part C and Part D Plans**
- Request PAID Act query from liability carrier
- Contact any identified Medicare Advantage (Part C) plans directly
- Contact any identified Prescription Drug (Part D) plans directly
- These are separate liens requiring independent resolution

**Step 2.5: Obtain Final Demand**
- When settlement is imminent (within 120 days), initiate Final CP Process
- Request final demand no more than 3 days before settlement finalization
- Document final demand amount and payment deadline

**Step 2.6: Calculate Reductions**
- Apply automatic pro-rata procurement cost reduction:
  ```
  Reduction = Final Demand × (Attorney Fees + Costs) ÷ Gross Settlement
  Net Medicare Payment = Final Demand - Reduction
  ```

**Step 2.7: Consider Waiver/Compromise**
- **Waiver Request:** Available only after final demand issued; for hardship cases
  - Note: Interest continues accruing during waiver review
- **Compromise Request:** Available any time; cannot be appealed
- Document basis for any reduction request (hardship, limited policy)

**Step 2.8: Remit Payment**
- Pay final amount before deadline
- Document payment confirmation
- Retain proof of satisfaction

---

#### **Phase 3: Medicaid Lien Resolution**

**Step 3.1: Contact State Medicaid Agency**
- Identify the correct state Medicaid program (e.g., TennCare, Medi-Cal)
- Submit lien notification with case details
- Request itemized statement of payments

**Step 3.2: Verify Charges**
- Audit Medicaid charges for injury-relatedness
- Note: Per *Gallardo v. Marstiller*, Medicaid may recover from both past and future medical allocations

**Step 3.3: Negotiate Resolution**
- Contact state agency for final lien amount
- Document any reduction agreements
- Obtain written satisfaction upon payment

---

#### **Phase 4: Medicaid Eligibility Preservation**

**Step 4.1: Pre-Settlement Assessment**
- Confirm client's current asset/income levels
- Identify state-specific Medicaid thresholds
- Calculate projected net recovery
- Determine if net recovery will exceed asset limits

**Step 4.2: Strategy Selection (Decision Tree)**

```
Is the beneficiary age 64 or younger?
├── YES → Primary strategy: First-Party Special Needs Trust (SNT)
└── NO (65+) → Primary strategy: Pooled/Community Trust

Is settlement small enough for spend-down within month of receipt?
└── YES → Consider Spend-Down Strategy (exempt assets, debts)
```

**Step 4.3: Trust Implementation**
- Coordinate with special needs planning attorney
- Ensure trust is established before settlement distribution
- Direct net settlement funds into trust from firm trust account
- Document trust funding and Medicaid notification

---

#### **Phase 5: VA Lien Resolution**

**Step 5.1: Initiate VA Search**
- Contact VA Medical Center where client received treatment
- Request itemized statement of accident-related charges
- Contact Judge Advocate Office for lien assertion

**Step 5.2: Resolution**
- VA generally does not reduce billed charges
- Submit formal compromise/waiver request if grounds exist
- Pay lien amount and obtain satisfaction

---

#### **Phase 6: TRICARE Lien Resolution**

**Step 6.1: Initiate Separate TRICARE Search**
- TRICARE is separate from Medicare and VA
- Contact appropriate TRICARE recovery contractor
- Request lien amount for accident-related charges

**Step 6.2: Resolution**
- Negotiate lien amount
- Pay and obtain written satisfaction

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation

| Red Flag | Risk | Action Required |
|----------|------|-----------------|
| Medicare beneficiary with no BCRC case registration | Double damages liability under MSPA | Escalate immediately; register case |
| Medicaid recipient approaching settlement without preservation plan | Loss of essential health benefits | Escalate; engage special needs attorney |
| Client turning 65 during litigation | Wrong trust type may be selected | Update strategy from SNT to Pooled Trust |
| Disbursement prepared before final Medicare demand received | Risk of underpayment, penalties | STOP disbursement; obtain final demand first |
| Part C/D plans not investigated | Unresolved separate liens | Query PAID Act database; contact plans |
| Settlement for future medicals without MSA consideration | Medicare denial of future care | Evaluate Medicare Set-Aside requirement |

#### Validation Checks

- [ ] All government benefit programs have been queried
- [ ] All conditional payment letters have been audited for accuracy
- [ ] All unrelated charges have been disputed
- [ ] Final demands have been received before disbursement preparation
- [ ] Pro-rata procurement cost reductions have been calculated
- [ ] Part C and Part D plans have been separately resolved
- [ ] Medicaid eligibility preservation strategy is in place (if applicable)
- [ ] All payments have been documented with proof of satisfaction

#### When to Escalate to Attorney

1. Client disputes benefit status or refuses to provide identifiers
2. Medicare dispute is denied and appeal is warranted
3. Waiver/compromise decision requires strategic evaluation
4. Trust planning involves complex family or financial circumstances
5. Settlement structure affects MSA requirements
6. Multiple government programs have conflicting interests
7. Tight timeline threatens compliance deadlines
