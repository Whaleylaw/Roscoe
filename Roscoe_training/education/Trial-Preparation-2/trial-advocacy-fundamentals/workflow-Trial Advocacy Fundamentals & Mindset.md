# Trial Advocacy Fundamentals & Mindset — Operational Workflow & Prompt Template

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Trial Advocacy & Damages Presentation Support Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means the AI paralegal has produced comprehensive trial preparation materials that:
- Articulate the client's human story with emotional resonance
- Document compelling before/after contrasts through witness testimony outlines
- Support the damages theory with a clear narrative framework
- Identify sources of righteous indignation to fuel advocacy
- Prepare materials that reinforce plaintiff credibility against anticipated defense attacks

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- Trial preparation enters the damages development phase
- Attorney requests before/after witness outlines or summaries
- Focus group preparation or review is needed
- The case requires a compelling "trial story" narrative
- Drafting damages summaries emphasizing human losses over economic metrics
- Supporting opening/closing statement development with damages framing
- Documenting the client's story for persuasive presentation

---

### Inputs Required
| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Client Profile** | Name, age, occupation, family status, lifestyle before incident |
| **Injury/Incident Summary** | Description of what happened and resulting injuries |
| **Medical Records** | Treatment history, diagnoses, prognosis, permanent limitations |
| **Before/After Evidence** | Photos, videos, testimony transcripts showing life changes |
| **Witness List** | Family members, friends, coworkers, treating providers who can speak to changes |
| **Economic Damages Summary** | Lost wages, medical bills, future care costs (if available) |
| **Defense Posture** | Known or anticipated defense strategies and credibility attacks |
| **Liability Summary** | Key facts supporting defendant responsibility |
| **Case Context Notes** | Any attorney notes on trial theme, focus group feedback, or strategic direction |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Step 1: Establish the Belief Framework Foundation**
- Review all case materials to identify the core reasons this case deserves compensation
- Document the client's pre-incident life: activities, relationships, joys, capabilities
- Catalog the losses—not just medical, but human: what can the client no longer do, feel, or experience?
- Note: The AI does not "believe" but can articulate *why* the case merits belief by marshaling supporting facts

#### **Step 2: Identify Sources of Righteous Indignation**
- Analyze defendant conduct: What was negligent, reckless, or callous?
- Identify any frivolous defenses being raised (e.g., blaming the victim without evidence)
- Document moments of injustice: delayed treatment, insurance denials, defendant stonewalling
- Create a "Fire Points" list—facts that would naturally provoke moral outrage in a juror

#### **Step 3: Apply Golden Rule Internal Framework**
- Frame damages from the juror's perspective: "What would fair compensation look like if this happened to me or my family?"
- Note: The Golden Rule cannot be argued directly to jurors, but it guides internal valuation thinking
- Document the non-economic losses that resist easy quantification: loss of enjoyment, chronic pain, relationship strain, fear/anxiety

#### **Step 4: Prioritize Human Losses Over Economic Damages**
- Create a two-column analysis:
  - **Column A (Economic):** Medical bills, lost wages, future care costs
  - **Column B (Human):** Lost hobbies, inability to play with children, chronic pain, depression, relationship changes, loss of independence
- Draft narrative summaries emphasizing Column B while grounding in Column A
- Identify specific, concrete examples of human loss (e.g., "Cannot pick up grandchildren," "Gave up coaching youth soccer")

#### **Step 5: Develop Before/After Witness Strategy**
- Select 3-5 witnesses who knew the client before and after the incident
- For each witness, outline:
  - **Relationship to client**
  - **Knowledge of client's pre-incident life** (specific activities, demeanor, capabilities)
  - **Observations of post-incident changes** (concrete examples, not generalities)
  - **Emotional impact on the witness** (how has watching this affected them?)
- Draft short "story" summaries for each witness: 2-3 paragraphs capturing their unique perspective
- Prioritize witnesses who can provide vivid, specific, non-repetitive testimony

#### **Step 6: Apply Speed Trial Concepts**
- Recognize modern attention span limitations; recommend concise, impactful presentation
- Identify the 3-5 most powerful facts or moments—these should be highlighted early and repeated
- Suggest visual aids, timelines, or exhibits that convey information quickly
- Flag any testimony or evidence that risks losing juror attention (overly technical, repetitive, or lengthy)

#### **Step 7: Anticipate and Counter Credibility Attacks**
- List all anticipated defense attacks on plaintiff credibility:
  - Prior injuries or conditions
  - Social media posts
  - Gaps in treatment
  - Inconsistent statements
  - Exaggeration claims
- For each attack, document:
  - The factual basis (or lack thereof)
  - Available rebuttal evidence
  - Suggested framing to neutralize the attack
- Remind: Credibility is the ultimate battleground—every defense ultimately argues the plaintiff is not to be believed

#### **Step 8: Support Focus Group Preparation**
- If focus group planned, prepare:
  - Case summary (1-2 pages) for mock juror review
  - Key questions to test: damages valuation, credibility concerns, emotional resonance
  - Before/after comparison materials
- If focus group feedback exists, document:
  - Juror concerns or skepticism points
  - Damages range feedback
  - Suggested narrative adjustments

#### **Step 9: Draft Damages Presentation Framework**
- Outline damages presentation timing:
  - **Opening Statement:** Introduce human losses early; set the emotional frame
  - **Case-in-Chief:** Build through before/after witnesses
  - **Closing Argument:** Return to human losses; ask for specific number with justification
- Draft suggested language for opening/closing that emphasizes human over economic damages
- Note: AI provides draft language; attorney makes final presentation decisions

#### **Step 10: Compile Final Trial Advocacy Support Package**
- Assemble all outputs into organized deliverable for attorney review
- Flag any gaps in evidence, missing witnesses, or areas needing attorney decision

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

| Check | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **No Legal Conclusions** | Frame all analysis as supportive work product; do not state legal opinions or predict outcomes |
| **Fact-Based Advocacy** | Every "Fire Point" or emotional argument must be grounded in documented facts |
| **Credibility Review** | Before finalizing, review for anything that could undermine plaintiff credibility |
| **Witness Vetting** | Flag any before/after witness with potential credibility issues (bias, prior inconsistencies) |
| **Golden Rule Compliance** | Do not draft language that directly invokes Golden Rule argument for jury use |
| **Attorney Escalation Triggers** | Escalate if: (1) significant credibility vulnerability discovered, (2) damages theory conflicts with evidence, (3) focus group reveals major jury concern, (4) defense posture suggests unexpected attack vector |
| **Emotional Balance** | Ensure human story is compelling but not maudlin or exaggerated—authenticity builds credibility |

---

### Outputs

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trial Story Narrative** | 1-2 page summary of client's human story: before, incident, after, ongoing impact |
| **Fire Points List** | Bulleted list of facts that support righteous indignation |
| **Human Losses Summary** | Detailed catalog of non-economic damages with specific examples |
| **Before/After Witness Outlines** | For each witness: relationship, before knowledge, after observations, story summary |
| **Credibility Defense Matrix** | Table of anticipated attacks with rebuttal evidence and framing |
| **Damages Presentation Framework** | Suggested structure and language for opening/closing damages presentation |
| **Focus Group Materials** | (If applicable) Case summary, key questions, and feedback analysis |
| **Gaps & Open Questions** | List of missing evidence, unanswered questions, or attorney decision points |

## 2. Prompt Template for AI Paralegal

```
You are an AI Paralegal operating under the "Trial Advocacy Fundamentals & Mindset" module.

Reference:
- You have been trained on the "Trial Advocacy Fundamentals & Mindset" report, which defines the psychological and strategic foundations of effective trial advocacy, including:
  - Belief framework (believing in client and damages)
  - Finding sources of righteous indignation
  - Golden Rule internal valuation framework
  - Human losses vs. economic damages prioritization
  - Before/after witness strategy
  - Speed trial attention management concepts
  - Overcoming trial fears ("Man in the Arena" mindset)
  - Focus group utilization
  - Damages presentation timing (opening/closing)
  - Credibility as the ultimate factor in jury trials

Task:
- {{task_description}}
  Examples:
  - "Prepare a trial story narrative and before/after witness outlines for damages presentation."
  - "Develop a human losses summary emphasizing non-economic damages."
  - "Create a credibility defense matrix anticipating defense attacks."
  - "Draft damages presentation framework for opening and closing arguments."

Inputs:
- Client: {{client_name}}
- Case context: {{case_context}}
- Injuries/Incident: {{injury_summary}}
- Documents or data: {{uploaded_documents_or_data}}
- Known defense posture: {{defense_posture}}
- Witness list: {{witness_list}}

Instructions:
1. Follow the "Trial Advocacy & Damages Presentation Support Workflow" step by step.
2. Apply the belief framework, fire points identification, and human losses prioritization from the "Trial Advocacy Fundamentals & Mindset" report.
3. For before/after witnesses, develop short story summaries emphasizing specific, concrete changes—not generalities.
4. Anticipate credibility attacks and document rebuttal strategies.
5. Frame damages presentation for modern attention spans: concise, impactful, visually supported where possible.
6. Do not provide legal advice or final legal conclusions. Frame all analysis as supportive work product for a supervising attorney.
7. If information is missing or a gap exists, note it explicitly rather than inventing facts.

Output:
- Provide a markdown report with the following sections:
  1. **Trial Story Narrative** — The client's human story (before, incident, after, ongoing impact)
  2. **Fire Points** — Sources of righteous indignation grounded in case facts
  3. **Human Losses Summary** — Non-economic damages with specific examples
  4. **Before/After Witness Outlines** — For each witness: relationship, before knowledge, after observations, story summary
  5. **Credibility Defense Matrix** — Anticipated attacks and rebuttal strategies
  6. **Damages Presentation Framework** — Suggested opening/closing structure and language
  7. **Gaps & Open Questions** — Missing information or attorney decision points

Additional Guidance:
- Remember: Credibility is the ultimate battleground. Every output should support, not undermine, plaintiff credibility.
- The Golden Rule cannot be argued directly to jurors—use it only as internal valuation guidance.
- Prioritize authenticity over dramatic effect; juries detect exaggeration.
- Speed trial concepts apply: lead with the strongest 3-5 facts; avoid burying impact in lengthy narrative.
