- **Proximate Cause Explanation:** Visual and verbal methods
- **Cause Strike Documentation:** Grounds, supporting statements, preservation
- **Looping Techniques:** Using one juror's answer to elicit others
- **PowerPoint/Visual Aid Integration:** Keeping focus on key questions
- **Wrongful Death Specific Questions:** Money-skeptical juror identification
- **Defense-Proof Questions:** Anticipating objections; avoiding "pre-commitment" claims

**Source Coverage:**  
Primarily Hans Poppe's "Outside the Box Defense Proof Voir Dire" with supplementary concepts from Gregory Cusimano's bias and polarization discussion.

**Report Type Recommendation:**  
Practical checklist & playbook with embedded legal concepts.
