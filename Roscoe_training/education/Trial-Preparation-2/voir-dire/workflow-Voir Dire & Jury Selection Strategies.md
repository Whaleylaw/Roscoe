# Voir Dire & Jury Selection Strategies

## AI Paralegal Operational Workflow & Prompt Template

---

# 1. Operational Workflow

## Workflow Name
**Jury Selection Support & Voir Dire Preparation**

---

## Goal
Successful completion means the supervising attorney has:
- A comprehensive voir dire question bank tailored to the case type
- Visual aids prepared for burden of proof and proximate cause explanations
- Documented cause challenge grounds with supporting juror statements
- Bias/prejudice identification checklist customized to case facts
- Time-optimized questioning sequences for limited voir dire situations

---

## When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- Trial date is set and jury selection preparation is required
- Attorney requests voir dire question development
- Case involves wrongful death, punitive damages, or high-value claims
- Jurisdiction imposes strict time limits on voir dire
- Case type requires specialized juror screening (e.g., texting-while-driving, medical malpractice)
- Defense has raised pre-trial arguments about juror "pre-commitment"

---

## Inputs Required

| Input | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Case type | Category of claim (wrongful death, personal injury, medical malpractice, etc.) | Case file, attorney |
| Jurisdiction rules | Time limits, judge-led vs. attorney-led voir dire, cause challenge standards | Local rules, attorney |
| Case facts summary | Key facts, defendants, damages sought | Case overview document |
| Defense arguments | Anticipated defense themes and pre-trial motions | Pleadings, discovery |
| Juror questionnaire (if any) | Pre-trial juror responses | Court documents |
| Prior verdict history | Similar case verdicts in jurisdiction | Legal research |

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Case-Specific Juror Risk Profiling
**Objective:** Identify juror characteristics that pose risks to the case.

**Actions:**
1. Review case type and identify common bias indicators:
   - **Wrongful death:** Skepticism about monetary compensation for loss of life
   - **Punitive damages:** Opposition to "punishment" through civil awards
   - **Medical malpractice:** Deference to doctors, healthcare workers
   - **Texting while driving:** "Everyone does it" normalization bias
   
2. Document defense themes and map to juror attitudes:
   - If defense argues "greedy plaintiff" → screen for anti-lawsuit bias
   - If defense argues "plaintiff's fault" → screen for comparative fault prejudice
   - If defense argues "too much money" → screen for damages caps beliefs

3. Create **Juror Risk Profile Matrix**:
   | Risk Factor | High-Risk Indicator | Questioning Area |
   |-------------|---------------------|------------------|
   | [Factor 1] | [Indicator] | [Question topic] |
   | [Factor 2] | [Indicator] | [Question topic] |

---

### Step 2: Bias vs. Prejudice Classification
**Objective:** Understand and apply legal distinctions for cause challenges.

**Key Definitions:**
- **Bias:** A mental inclination or leaning toward one side; may be challengeable for cause if strong enough
- **Prejudice:** A preformed judgment or opinion that prevents fair consideration of the case; typically grounds for automatic cause strike

**Actions:**
1. Draft questions designed to surface both bias AND prejudice
2. Classify juror responses using this framework:
   | Response Type | Classification | Challenge Strategy |
   |---------------|----------------|-------------------|
   | "I lean toward believing..." | Bias | Develop further; may rehabilitate |
   | "I could never award..." | Prejudice | Document for cause challenge |
   | "I'd try to be fair, but..." | Potential bias | Probe underlying beliefs |

3. Prepare **Cause Challenge Documentation Template**:
   ```
   Juror: [Name/Number]
   Statement: "[Exact quote]"
   Classification: [Bias/Prejudice]
   Legal Basis: [Applicable standard]
   Rehabilitation Attempted: [Yes/No, outcome]
   Challenge: [For cause/Peremptory]
   ```

---

### Step 3: Time-Limited Voir Dire Optimization
**Objective:** Prioritize critical questions when time is constrained.

**Actions:**
1. Determine time allocation (e.g., 20 minutes per side)
2. Calculate available questions (approximately 1-2 minutes per substantive question exchange)
3. Prioritize questions using this hierarchy:
   
   **Priority 1 – Disqualifying Questions (Must Ask)**
   - "Can you award money for [type of loss]?"
   - "Do you have beliefs that would prevent you from being fair?"
   - "Have you had experiences that would affect your judgment in this case?"
   
   **Priority 2 – Theme-Testing Questions (Should Ask)**
   - Questions testing reactions to key case facts
   - Questions about attitudes toward parties/industries involved
   
   **Priority 3 – Rapport-Building Questions (Time Permitting)**
   - Open-ended questions about life experiences
   - Questions designed to make jurors comfortable speaking

4. Create **Time-Blocked Question Schedule**:
   | Time Block | Duration | Question Type | Specific Questions |
   |------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
   | Block 1 | 5 min | Disqualifying | Q1, Q2, Q3 |
   | Block 2 | 10 min | Theme-testing | Q4-Q8 |
   | Block 3 | 5 min | Follow-up/Looping | As needed |

---

### Step 4: Visual Aid Development
**Objective:** Prepare visual materials to clarify legal concepts during voir dire.

**Actions:**
1. **Burden of Proof Visualization:**
   - Create "scales of justice" graphic showing preponderance standard
   - Develop verbal script: "More likely than not means if you believe it's 51% likely our client's version is true..."
   - Prepare comparison to everyday decisions (e.g., "like deciding which route to take based on slightly better odds")

2. **Proximate Cause Illustration:**
   - Prepare chain-of-events diagram
   - Draft explanation: "If [defendant's action] was a substantial factor in causing [harm], even if not the only factor..."

3. **Defense-Proof Visuals:**
   - Ensure all visuals are neutral and educational, not argumentative
   - Avoid anything that could be characterized as "pre-committing" jurors

4. Create **Visual Aid Inventory**:
   | Visual | Purpose | Defense-Proof Check |
   |--------|---------|---------------------|
   | [Visual 1] | [Purpose] | [✓/Needs revision] |

---

### Step 5: Looping Technique Preparation
**Objective:** Develop strategies to use juror responses to engage others.

**Actions:**
1. Identify "anchor questions" likely to generate discussable responses
2. Prepare looping scripts:
   - "Ms. Smith mentioned that [response]. Does anyone else have similar thoughts or different perspectives?"
   - "We heard from Mr. Jones about [topic]. Who else has experience with this?"
   
3. Document which questions are best for:
   - **Opening discussion:** Broad, non-threatening topics
   - **Building consensus:** Shared experiences or values
   - **Identifying outliers:** Questions that reveal unusual positions

---

### Step 6: Cause Challenge Preservation Protocol
**Objective:** Ensure all cause challenges are properly documented and preserved.

**Actions:**
1. Create real-time documentation system:
   - Juror number
   - Exact statement (verbatim if possible)
   - Time/context
   - Follow-up questions asked
   - Rehabilitation attempts

2. Prepare **Cause Challenge Brief Template**:
   ```
   IN RE: [Case Name]
   PLAINTIFF'S CAUSE CHALLENGE – JUROR [NUMBER]
   
   GROUNDS:
   [State legal basis for challenge]
   
   SUPPORTING STATEMENTS:
   [Verbatim quotes with timestamps]
   
   REHABILITATION:
   [Attempts made and results]
   
   CONCLUSION:
   Juror has demonstrated [bias/prejudice] that cannot be rehabilitated.
   ```

3. Identify backup challenges if cause is denied (peremptory allocation)

---

### Step 7: Case-Type Specific Question Banks
**Objective:** Develop specialized questions for common case categories.

**Wrongful Death Cases:**
- "Have you ever thought about whether money can compensate for the loss of a loved one?"
- "What are your feelings about lawsuits where someone is seeking money after a death?"
- "Do you believe there are losses that simply cannot be measured in dollars?"

**Punitive Damages Cases:**
- "What are your views on punishing companies through civil lawsuits versus criminal charges?"
- "Do you believe corporations should be held to the same standards as individuals?"
- "How do you feel about jury awards designed to send a message?"

**Medical Malpractice:**
- "Do you have family members or close friends in healthcare?"
- "Have you ever felt that a doctor made a mistake in treating you or a loved one?"
- "Do you believe doctors should be protected from lawsuits to encourage people to enter medicine?"

**Motor Vehicle – Distracted Driving:**
- "Have you ever used your phone while driving?"
- "What are your views on texting while driving?"
- "Do you think people who cause accidents while texting should be treated differently than other negligent drivers?"

---

### Step 8: Defense-Proof Question Review
**Objective:** Ensure all questions cannot be attacked as improper pre-commitment.

**Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Questions ask about juror attitudes, not commitments
- [ ] Questions use "could you consider" not "would you find"
- [ ] Questions explore existing beliefs, not case-specific facts
- [ ] No questions that telegraph the "right" answer
- [ ] No questions that argue the case under guise of questioning

**Revision Examples:**
| ❌ Problematic | ✅ Defense-Proof |
|---------------|------------------|
| "Would you award significant damages in this case?" | "What are your general views on significant jury awards?" |
| "Will you follow the law on preponderance?" | "What do you understand about the burden of proof in civil cases?" |
| "Do you agree the defendant was negligent?" | "What experiences have shaped your views on responsibility?" |

## Quality Checks & Safeguards

### Validation Checks
- [ ] All questions reviewed for jurisdictional compliance
- [ ] Time allocation verified against court rules
- [ ] Visual aids checked for neutrality and accuracy
- [ ] Cause challenge documentation templates prepared
- [ ] Backup peremptory strategy identified

### Red Flags – Escalate to Attorney
- Juror questionnaire reveals undisclosed relationships with parties
- Juror expresses fixed opinions that cannot be rehabilitated
- Judge indicates intent to limit voir dire more than expected
- Defense files motion challenging voir dire approach
- Juror pool demographics significantly differ from expectations

### Ethical Boundaries
- **DO NOT** draft questions that argue the case
- **DO NOT** prepare materials that pre-commit jurors to verdicts
- **DO NOT** create questions designed to extract promises
- **DO** focus on exploring existing attitudes and beliefs
- **DO** prepare educational materials about legal standards
