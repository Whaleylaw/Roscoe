# Wrongful Death Damages Analysis Module

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Wrongful Death Damages Assessment Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successfully compile a comprehensive damages analysis for a wrongful death case that includes:
- Complete pecuniary loss calculation framework (lost financial support, household services, guidance/companionship)
- Conscious pain and suffering evidence inventory with survival period documentation
- 360-degree witness mapping for building the decedent's story
- Expert witness requirement identification
- Consolidated evidence checklist with gap analysis

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- A new wrongful death case is opened or assigned
- Case involves fatal injuries from negligence, medical malpractice, product liability, or vehicular accident
- Attorney requests damages analysis or case valuation memo
- Preparing for demand letter, mediation, or trial damages presentation
- Reviewing an existing wrongful death case for completeness

---

### Inputs Required
| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `client_name` | Name of the surviving plaintiff(s)/estate representative |
| `decedent_name` | Name of the deceased |
| `case_context` | Brief description of incident, date of death, and alleged liability |
| `jurisdiction` | State/county where case is filed (affects consortium recovery rules) |
| `survival_period` | Known or estimated time between injury and death |
| `family_composition` | Surviving spouse, children (ages), parents, dependents |
| `uploaded_documents` | Any available records: death certificate, autopsy, police reports, medical records, tax returns, employment records, family photos/videos |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Case Intake & Jurisdiction Check**

**Step 1.1** — Document the decedent's basic profile
- Full legal name, date of birth, date of death
- Age at death and life expectancy (actuarial tables)
- Marital status and dependent family members
- Employment status and occupation at time of death

**Step 1.2** — Verify jurisdictional rules
- Confirm applicable wrongful death statute and survival action statute
- Note any damages caps or limitations
- **Critical:** Verify rules on loss of consortium/companionship recovery—these vary significantly by jurisdiction
- Identify statute of limitations and any pending deadlines

---

#### **Phase 2: Pecuniary Loss Analysis**

**Step 2.1** — Lost Financial Support Calculation Framework

| Sub-Step | Action | Evidence Needed |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 2.1.1 | Document income history | W-2s, 1099s, tax returns (5-10 years) |
| 2.1.2 | Map career trajectory | Employment records, performance reviews, promotion history |
| 2.1.3 | Project future earnings | Work life expectancy tables, industry wage growth data |
| 2.1.4 | Calculate dependent's share | Estimate personal consumption deduction (typically 25-40%) |
| 2.1.5 | Inventory fringe benefits | Pension statements, 401(k) projections, health insurance value |
| 2.1.6 | Document household contributions | Bank statements, evidence of financial support to dependents |

**Step 2.2** — Lost Household Services Valuation

| Sub-Step | Action | Evidence Needed |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| 2.2.1 | Interview survivors | Detailed list of tasks decedent performed |
| 2.2.2 | Quantify time allocation | Hours per week for each household service category |
| 2.2.3 | Research replacement costs | Market rates for housekeeping, childcare, home maintenance, landscaping in relevant geographic area |

| 2.3.3 | Collect relational evidence | Correspondence, journals, emails showing emotional support |
| 2.3.4 | Anchor intangibles to costs | Identify market replacement costs for decedent's special contributions (tutoring, coaching, counseling) |

---

#### **Phase 3: Conscious Pain and Suffering Evidence**

**Step 3.1** — Establish Survival Period
- Document exact time from injury to death (if known)
- Identify whether death was instantaneous vs. delayed
- **Note:** Even brief survival (minutes) can support substantial claim

**Step 3.2** — Police and Scene Evidence Analysis

| Document | Critical Data Points to Extract |
|----------|--------------------------------|
| Police accident report | Officer observations of victim's condition |
| Scene photographs | Evidence of post-impact movement, self-protective actions (hands raised, attempts to exit vehicle) |
| Dispatch recordings | Timeline of incident and response |

**Step 3.3** — Eyewitness Testimony Coordination

Develop witness questionnaire addressing:
- [ ] Was the victim conscious?
- [ ] Did they speak, moan, or make sounds?
- [ ] Did they appear to be in pain?
- [ ] Were their eyes open?
- [ ] What specific observations suggested awareness of surroundings or injuries?
- [ ] What was the victim's position and did it change?

**Step 3.4** — Emergency Medical Records Review

| Record Type | Critical Data Points |
|-------------|---------------------|
| EMT run sheets | Conscious vs. unconscious status upon arrival |
| Vital signs | Evidence of physiological stress response |
| Neurological tests | Pupil reactions, pain response documentation |
| Dispatch records | Timeline and patient condition updates |

**Step 3.5** — Hospital Records Review (if applicable)

| Record Type | Critical Data Points |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Triage notes | Initial consciousness assessment |
| Nursing notes | Pain scale ratings, observed grimacing/moaning |
| Physician notes | Level of consciousness (Alert/Verbal/Pain/Unresponsive scale) |
| Treatment records | Responses to painful procedures |

**Step 3.6** — Autopsy Report Analysis

| Finding Type | Significance |
|--------------|--------------|
| Systemic stress response | Indicates living person responding to trauma |
| Survival interval indicators | Physiological evidence of time alive post-injury |
| Cause of death timeline | Distinguishes instantaneous vs. delayed death |

---

#### **Phase 4: Building the Decedent's Story**

**Step 4.1** — 360-Degree Witness Analysis

Map witnesses from every facet of decedent's life:

| Sphere | Witness Categories |
|--------|-------------------|
| Family | Spouse, children, parents, siblings, extended family |
| Social | Close friends, neighbors |
| Professional | Co-workers, supervisors, business partners |
| Community | Religious group members, volunteer organizations, clubs |
| Unexpected | Service providers (like the "newspaper vendor" example), teachers, coaches |

**Step 4.2** — Witness Interview Framework

For each witness, document:
1. **Role testimony**: Which specific role can they speak to (parent, spouse, employee, friend)?
2. **Anecdotes**: What specific stories illustrate the decedent's character?
3. **Before/After delta**: How has the witness's life changed since the death?
4. **Credibility factors**: Disinterested witnesses often most powerful

**Step 4.3** — Documentary Evidence Assembly

| Category | Items to Collect |
|----------|-----------------|
| Visual | Photos/videos of family activities, community involvement |
| Written | Letters, emails, cards demonstrating relationships |
| Professional | Employment records, awards, business plans |
| Community | Certificates, news articles, volunteer recognition |

*Framing Strategy*: Present evidence as story of heroism/contribution, not victimhood. Focus on what decedent accomplished and the effort they invested in their relationships.

---

#### **Phase 5: Expert Witness Requirements**

**Step 5.1** — Identify Required Experts

| Expert Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Forensic Economist** | Project lost earnings, calculate personal consumption rate, determine present value of economic losses |
| **Vocational Expert** | Quantify market replacement cost of household services |
| **Medical Expert** | Testify to survival period, conscious awareness, pain experience |
| **Life Care Planner** | (If dependents have special needs) Project future care costs |

**Step 5.2** — Prepare Expert Materials Package
- Compile all financial documents for economist
- Create household services summary for vocational expert
- Organize medical records chronologically for medical expert

---

#### **Phase 6: Gap Analysis & Report Generation**

**Step 6.1** — Checklist Audit
Review all checklist items and flag:
- ✅ Evidence obtained
- ⚠️ Evidence requested but not yet received
- ❌ Evidence not available or not applicable
- ❓ Unknown — requires further investigation

**Step 6.2** — Generate Damages Analysis Report
Compile findings into structured memo including:
1. Executive Summary
2. Pecuniary Loss Framework (with calculation ranges if possible)
3. Conscious Pain and Suffering Evidence Summary
4. Witness Inventory with Testimony Themes
5. Documentary Evidence Index
6. Expert Witness Recommendations
7. Outstanding Items / Gap Analysis
8. Jurisdictional Notes

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All financial projections sourced from documents (no speculation)
- [ ] Survival period claims supported by at least one medical or eyewitness source
- [ ] Jurisdictional rules on consortium/companionship verified
- [ ] Expert witness needs identified for all calculation-dependent claims
- [ ] Before-and-after framing avoids gratuitous victimization language

#### Red Flags — Escalate to Attorney
| Red Flag | Reason for Escalation |
|----------|----------------------|
| Instantaneous death claimed but eyewitness suggests otherwise | Material impact on conscious suffering claim |
| Missing tax returns or employment records | Cannot establish lost earnings baseline |
| Conflicting accounts of survival period | Requires strategic decision on evidence presentation |
| Decedent had pre-existing conditions or reduced life expectancy | Defense argument; needs attorney strategy |
| Jurisdictional ambiguity on consortium recovery | Legal research required |
| Potential comparative fault issues | Affects damages recovery |
| Autopsy not performed or unavailable | May need to subpoena or explain gap |

#### Ethical Guardrails
- **Do not** provide legal conclusions on liability or case valuation
- **Do not** advise survivors directly—all communications through supervising attorney
- **Do not** speculate on damages figures without supporting documentation
- **Frame all analysis** as work product for attorney review
