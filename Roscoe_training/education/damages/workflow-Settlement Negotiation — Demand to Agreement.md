### Step-by-Step Process

---

## **PHASE 1: Timing Assessment — MMI Verification**

### Step 1.1: Determine MMI Status

**Action:** Review medical records to determine if client has reached Maximum Medical Improvement.

**MMI Definition:** The clinical point at which a client's medical condition has stabilized and no significant further improvement is reasonably expected, with or without additional treatment.

**Verification Criteria:**
- [ ] Treating physician has provided final prognosis
- [ ] Client has completed recommended treatment protocol
- [ ] No surgeries or major procedures are pending
- [ ] Condition is stable (no recent significant changes)
- [ ] Long-term prognosis can be reliably established

### Step 1.2: Document MMI Determination

**If MMI Reached:**
- Document the MMI date
- Compile final prognosis documentation
- Proceed to Phase 2

**If MMI NOT Reached:**
- Flag case as "Pre-MMI — Not Ready for Settlement"
- Document expected timeline to MMI
- Set reminder for reassessment
- Advise attorney of risks of premature settlement

### Step 1.3: Evaluate Exception Criteria (If Early Settlement Considered)

**Only consider early settlement if:**

| Exception Criteria | Required Documentation |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| Clear liability + catastrophic permanency | Medical certainty documentation (e.g., amputation, paralysis) |
| Adequate offer despite early timing | Written rationale justifying "worst-case" prognosis valuation |

**Required for ANY Early Settlement:**
- [ ] Written rationale in client file
- [ ] Client's signed acknowledgment of risks
- [ ] Client's informed consent documentation

---

## **PHASE 2: Insurance Reserve Intelligence**

### Step 2.1: Understand Reserve Dynamics

**Key Principle:** The demand package's primary objective is to influence the insurer's internal reserve setting. High reserve = high settlement ceiling.

**Strategic Implications:**
- Adjuster cannot settle above reserve without supervisory approval
- Reserve increase requires adjuster to justify prior undervaluation
- Institutional resistance exists against reserve increases
- Package must provide adjuster with ammunition for internal justification

### Step 2.2: Identify Reserve-Influencing Factors

**Document these high-impact elements:**
- [ ] Most severe diagnoses
- [ ] Objective findings (positive EMG, MRI results, fracture documentation)
- [ ] Surgical procedures performed
- [ ] Permanent impairment ratings
- [ ] Life-altering impact evidence

---

## **PHASE 3: Strategic Demand Package Construction**

### Step 3.1: Execute Pre-Demand Checklist

- [ ] Has the client reached Maximum Medical Improvement (MMI)?
- [ ] Have all medical records and itemized bills been collected?
- [ ] Have all Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms been collected?
- [ ] Have all past wage loss and/or future earning capacity evidence been documented?
- [ ] Has a 360-degree witness analysis been completed to identify key lay witnesses?
- [ ] Have all potential medical and subrogation liens been identified?

### Step 3.2: Compile Core Demand Components

| Component | Content Requirements | Strategic Focus |
|-----------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Executive Summary** | 1-page overview with key facts and demand amount | Front-page visibility for adjuster |
| **Table of Contents** | Organized reference to all sections | Professional presentation |
| **Factual Narrative** | Clear accident description, defendant fault emphasis | Severity of impact, use photographs |
| **Injury Description** | Plain language, "before and after" framework | Illustrate functional life impact |
| **Medical Summary** | Chronological by provider, objective findings highlighted | Front-load severe diagnoses for algorithmic capture |
| **Itemized Expenses** | All bills + summary spreadsheet + EOBs | Document full billed amounts per collateral source rule |
| **Lost Wages/Earning Capacity** | Past income documentation + expert reports | Include vocational/economist projections |
| **Daily Life Impact** | 360-degree witness statements, Day-in-the-Life video | Document the "delta" — before vs. after |
| **Legal Argument** | Statutes, case law citations | Help adjuster justify internally |
| **Liability Analysis** | Proactively address comparative fault issues | Control the narrative |
| **Demand Amount** | Specific dollar figure, highest justifiable amount | Anchor high, leave room for negotiation |
| **Response Deadline** | 30 days, with lawsuit filing consequence | Create urgency and commitment |

### Step 3.3: Optimize for Algorithmic Review (Colossus Protocol)

**Front-Loading Requirements:**
- Place most severe diagnoses in first 7 listed
- Include within first 60 data points:
  - [ ] Primary diagnosis codes (ICD)
  - [ ] Procedure codes (CPT)
  - [ ] Surgical procedures
  - [ ] Positive objective findings
  - [ ] Fracture documentation
  - [ ] Permanent impairment ratings

**Human Review Flag Section:**
Create a clearly labeled section titled:

> **"INJURIES REQUIRING MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW"**

Include any of these injuries that apply:
- Death
- Brain injury / TBI
- Spinal cord damage
- Significant scarring (especially facial)
- Burns
- Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)
- Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

### Step 3.4: Identify Evidence for Strategic Withholding

**Candidate Evidence for Withholding:**
- [ ] Supplemental expert reports (vocational, life care)
- [ ] Powerful witness statements not yet disclosed
- [ ] Additional demonstrative evidence

**Purpose:** Reserve for impasse-breaking during negotiation.

**Ethical Boundary:** Do not withhold evidence that must be disclosed under discovery rules.

### Step 3.5: Execute Demand Package QA Checklist

- [ ] Does the package include a one-page executive summary and table of contents?
- [ ] Is the medical summary chronologically organized and front-loaded with high-value facts for algorithmic review?
- [ ] Are all bills and records organized and clearly referenced?
- [ ] Is there a separate, clearly marked section for injuries requiring human review (non-Colossus injuries)?
- [ ] Does the demand state a specific dollar amount?
- [ ] Does the demand include a firm response deadline and state the consequence of non-compliance?

---

## **PHASE 4: Negotiation Execution**

### Step 4.1: Receive and Analyze Initial Offer

**Upon receiving offer, document:**
- Offer amount
- Date received
- Adjuster name/contact
- Any stated rationale

**Analysis:** Calculate offer as percentage of demand and documented damages.

### Step 4.2: Counter Lowball Offers (Do NOT Validate the Anchor)

**INCORRECT Response:**
- Making significant concessionary counter-offer
- Negotiating within their range
- Signaling willingness to settle low

**CORRECT Response:**
Shift burden of justification to adjuster using this script:

> *"I can't respond to that figure until I understand how you calculated it. Can you please specify which medical expenses you are excluding and why? How did you value the non-economic damages given the witness statements regarding [specific life impact]?"*

### Step 4.3: Deploy Advanced Negotiation Tactics

**Tactic 1: Damages vs. Liability Inquiry**

> *"Is your valuation low because you have a damages problem or a liability problem?"*

- If "damages problem" → Counter with supplemental medical evidence
- If "liability problem" → Provide additional fault evidence

**Tactic 2: "If You Were My Client" Role Reversal**

> *"How would you suggest I explain this offer to you if you were my client?"*

Creates psychological dissonance; pressures improvement to defensible level.

### Step 4.4: Execute Impasse Resolution Protocol

**When negotiations stall, escalate systematically:**

| Step | Action | Outcome Sought |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | Introduce withheld evidence | Provide justification for reserve increase |
| 2 | Propose mediation | Require carrier rep with full settlement authority |
| 3 | Demonstrate trial readiness | Retain trial experts, schedule defense depositions, share draft exhibits |
| 4 | File lawsuit | Force re-evaluation, introduce defense costs and excess verdict risk |

---

## **PHASE 5: Policy Limits Demand Protocol**

### Trigger Condition
Documented, provable damages **clearly and substantially exceed** available policy limits.

### Step 5.1: Execute Binary Choice Protocol

1. **Issue Clear Demand for Policy Limits**
   - Demand exact policy limit amount (not a penny more or less)
   - No negotiation language

2. **Provide Comprehensive Proof**
   - Complete documentation package
   - Irrefutable evidence damages exceed limits

3. **Present Binary Choice**
   - Option A: Tender full policy limits by deadline
   - Option B: Offer permanently withdrawn; lawsuit for full claim value

4. **Set Firm Deadline**
   - 20-30 days
   - Reasonable but urgent

5. **Include Bad Faith Preservation Language**

   > *"Carrier is hereby placed on notice that all internal communications, evaluations, and memoranda regarding the handling of this demand must be preserved for potential future litigation."*

6. **File Lawsuit Immediately Upon Expiration**
   - No further warnings
   - No extensions
   - Demonstrates absolute resolve

---

## **PHASE 6: Settlement Finalization**

### Step 6.1: Document Verbal Agreement

- Settlement amount agreed
- Date of agreement
- Parties to agreement
- Any special terms discussed

### Step 6.2: Review Settlement Agreement Components

| Component | Review Criteria |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Payment Terms** | Exact amount, deadline, payment form specified |
| **Release Language** | Limited to injuries/claims/parties at issue; reject overly broad releases |
| **Confidentiality** | Advise client of obligations before agreeing |
| **Lien Resolution** | Clear statement of how liens will be identified, negotiated, resolved |
| **Indemnification** | Reject or narrowly tailor to client's known obligations only |

### Step 6.3: Resolve All Liens

- [ ] Medicare/Medicaid conditional payments — obtain final lien amount
- [ ] Health insurance subrogation — negotiate reduction
- [ ] Hospital liens — obtain final amount
- [ ] ERISA plans — confirm subrogation requirements
- [ ] Negotiate all possible lien reductions

### Step 6.4: Prepare Closing Statement

Create detailed client closing statement showing:
- Gross settlement amount
- Attorney fees
- Case costs
- Each lien repayment amount
- **Net amount to client**

### Step 6.5: Execute Settlement Finalization Checklist

- [ ] Has the client provided written authority to accept the final settlement amount?
- [ ] Has the full settlement agreement and release been reviewed for accuracy and fairness?
- [ ] Have final, written confirmation of all lien amounts been received?
- [ ] Have all possible lien reductions been negotiated?
- [ ] Has a final closing statement been prepared for the client?
- [ ] Has the client reviewed and signed the closing statement?

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Mandatory Validation Points

| Checkpoint | Validation | Red Flag |
|------------|------------|----------|
| MMI Status | Physician documentation confirms stability | Pending surgery, recent significant change |
| EOB Documentation | Full billed amounts documented | Only negotiated rates captured |
| Lien Identification | All potential liens identified | Unknown subrogation claims |
| Release Scope | Limited to current case | Releases unknown future claims |
| Client Authority | Written consent documented | Verbal agreement only |
| Demand Deadline | Reasonable (30 days) with consequence | No deadline or vague timing |

#### Escalation Triggers — Notify Supervising Attorney When:

- [ ] Early settlement being considered before MMI
- [ ] Policy limits demand protocol to be invoked
- [ ] Impasse requiring lawsuit filing
- [ ] Release language appears overly broad
- [ ] Indemnification provisions create hidden liabilities
- [ ] Lien disputes that cannot be resolved
- [ ] Client disputes settlement terms
- [ ] Bad faith indicators observed in insurer conduct
- [ ] Any ethical concerns arise

#### Ethical Compliance Checkpoints

| Rule | Requirement | Verification |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Rule 1.2 | Settlement decision belongs exclusively to client | Documented client authority |
| Prompt Communication | All offers communicated promptly | Communication log maintained |
| Informed Consent | Client advised of all material terms before acceptance | Signed acknowledgment |
| Lien Resolution | All valid liens resolved before disbursement | Lien clearance documentation |
