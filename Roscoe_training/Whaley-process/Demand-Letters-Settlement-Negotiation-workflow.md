---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Demand Package Preparation & Settlement Negotiation Support**

---

### Goal

- All medical records, bills, and supporting evidence have been gathered
- Attorney requests preparation of a **demand letter** or **demand package**
- Responding to a **settlement offer** from an adjuster
- Adjuster behavior exhibits **red flags** requiring escalation analysis
- Finalizing a **settlement** (administration, lien resolution, disbursement)
- Approaching **year-end** (November–December) and evaluating timing strategy
- Evaluating whether to **file suit** as a negotiation lever

---

### Inputs Required

| Category | Required Documents/Data |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Liability Evidence** | Police reports, witness statements, photos/video, accident reconstruction reports, applicable traffic laws |
| **Medical Records** | Complete treatment records from all providers, diagnostic imaging, surgical reports, specialist opinions |
| **Medical Billing** | Itemized bills with CPT codes, prescription costs, DME costs, all diagnostic codes |
| **Lost Wages** | Employment records, pay stubs, employer verification letters, tax returns |
| **Coverage Information** | At-fault party's policy limits, client's UM/UIM coverage, MedPay amounts, excess/umbrella policies |
| **Lien Data** | Medicare/Medicaid conditional payment letters, ERISA plan recovery demands, workers' comp liens, medical provider liens |
| **Client Impact** | Client statements on daily life impact, "before and after" testimony from family/friends, documentation of lost activities |
| **Communication Logs** | All adjuster communications with dates, offers received, response times |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Pre-Demand Intelligence Gathering**

**Step 1.1 — Map the Insurance Landscape**
- Identify all potentially liable parties and their insurers
- Confirm liability policy limits (request disclosure per state law)
- Document client's UM/UIM and MedPay coverage amounts
- Research any excess or umbrella policies
- Note: Policy limits define the "financial sandbox" for negotiations

**Step 1.2 — Compile Coverage & Lien Summary**
Create a coverage matrix documenting:
```
| Party/Coverage Type | Carrier | Policy Limits | Contact | Status |
|---------------------|---------|---------------|---------|--------|
```

**Step 1.3 — Obtain Final Lien Amounts**
- Request final conditional payment letters from Medicare/Medicaid
- Confirm ERISA and workers' comp subrogation claims
- Compile medical provider lien totals
- Document MedPay usage and subrogation terms

---

#### **Phase 2: Demand Package Construction**

**Step 2.1 — Build the Narrative Framework**
Structure the demand letter (target: 3–5 pages) with these sections:
1. **Introduction** — Case caption, parties, date of loss
2. **Liability Section** — Methodical fault establishment with evidence citations
3. **Damages Section** — Chronological treatment narrative + economic/non-economic breakdown
4. **Demand Amount** — Specific figure with justification

**Step 2.2 — Construct the Liability Argument**
- Reference police report conclusions and citations issued
- Quote relevant witness statements
- Cite applicable traffic laws/statutes violated
- Include photos/video evidence demonstrating fault
- Note: Frame as "undeniable conclusion of negligence"

**Step 2.3 — Build the Damages Presentation**

*Medical Treatment Chronology:*
- Present all treatment in chronological order
- Show clear progression: injury → treatment → outcome
- Highlight key diagnoses with ICD codes
- Quote provider opinions on **causation** (linking injury to accident)
- Quote provider opinions on **prognosis** (long-term outlook)

*Economic Damages Table:*
```
| Category | Provider/Source | Amount | Documentation |
|----------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| Medical Bills | [Provider] | $X | Attached as Exhibit _ |
| Prescriptions | [Pharmacy] | $X | Rx records attached |
| Lost Wages | [Employer] | $X | Verification letter attached |
| Future Medical | [Life Care Plan] | $X | Expert report attached |
```

*Non-Economic Damages Narrative:*
- Use specific examples of daily life impact
- Document abandoned hobbies and activities
- Include family function disruptions
- Quote "before and after" witnesses
- Describe emotional and psychological toll

**Step 2.4 — Apply Colossus Countermeasures**
The demand MUST be engineered to defeat algorithmic undervaluation:

| Protocol | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Priority Placement** | List highest-impact factors (surgery, permanent impairment, scarring) within first 60 points of demand |
| **Code Capture** | Explicitly list ALL CPT codes and diagnostic codes with corresponding charges |
| **Duties Under Duress** | Document specific activities client can only perform with pain |
| **Loss of Enjoyment** | Itemize abandoned hobbies, missed family events, lifestyle changes |
| **Non-Colossus Injuries** | Emphasize TBI, PTSD, significant scarring, CRPS (require human evaluation) |
| **Scarring Valuation** | Include plastic surgeon's corrective surgery estimate |

**Step 2.5 — Compile Supporting Exhibits**
Organize demand package attachments:
- [ ] Police report
- [ ] Witness statements/affidavits
- [ ] Accident scene photos
- [ ] Vehicle damage photos
- [ ] All medical records (chronologically organized)
- [ ] All medical bills (itemized with codes)
- [ ] Lost wage documentation
- [ ] Before/after photos of client (if applicable)
- [ ] Life care plan (catastrophic cases)
- [ ] Economic loss report (if applicable)
- [ ] Medical illustrations/diagrams

---

#### **Phase 3: Strategic Negotiation Support**

**Step 3.1 — Set Initial Reserve Strategy**
- **Front-load** significant documentation to anchor high reserve
- Include early surgical bills and specialist reports
- Rationale: Adjusters face internal resistance when increasing low reserves later

**Step 3.2 — Monitor Communication Timeline**
Create communication log tracking:
```
| Date | Type | From/To | Summary | Response Due | Response Received |
|------|------|---------|---------|--------------|-------------------|
```

**Step 3.3 — Track Settlement Offers**
Maintain offer/counter-offer history:
```
| Date | Party | Amount | Response | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
```

**Step 3.4 — Counter Adjuster Tactics**

| Tactic Observed | Recommended Response |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Lowball Offer** | Respond with documented evidence, comparable verdicts, specific deficiency reasons |
| **Delay Tactics** | Document all delays, set reasonable deadlines, escalate to supervisor if persistent |
| **Refusing Policy Limits Disclosure** | Check state pre-suit disclosure laws; consider filing suit |
| **Disputing Clear Liability** | Counter with overwhelming proof (reconstruction, video, expert opinions) |
| **Stalled Negotiations** | Consider "cooling off" period; lawsuit filing removes claim from Colossus |
| **Bad Faith Indicators** | Begin meticulous documentation; prepare formal time-limited demand |

**Step 3.5 — Evaluate Strategic Timing**
- Flag **year-end window** (November–December) for push
- Insurers motivated to clear reserves before calendar year-end
- Consider timing of formal demands to leverage this pressure

---

#### **Phase 4: Red Flag Monitoring & Escalation**

**Step 4.1 — Monitor for Red Flags**
Flag immediately if adjuster:
- [ ] Makes consistently unsupported lowball offers
- [ ] Ignores demand letters for 30+ days without explanation
- [ ] Makes inconsistent coverage/liability statements
- [ ] Refuses to acknowledge significant new medical information
- [ ] Misrepresents policy provisions

**Step 4.2 — Document Bad Faith Indicators**
Capture verbatim:
- Any misrepresentations about coverage
- Unjustified refusals to settle within limits
- Unreasonable delays without explanation
- Statements refusing to justify low offers

**Step 4.3 — Escalation Decision Tree**
```
IF negotiation impasse → RECOMMEND lawsuit filing (removes from Colossus)
IF suspected bad faith → PREPARE formal time-limited demand ("Hartford letter")
IF clear liability + limits offer refused → DOCUMENT for potential excess verdict liability
```

---

#### **Phase 5: Settlement Administration**

**Step 5.1 — Pre-Settlement Checklist**
- [ ] Confirm client's final settlement authority in writing
- [ ] Verify final, updated medical bills and lien amounts
- [ ] Obtain final Medicare/Medicaid conditional payment letters
- [ ] Confirm workers' comp and ERISA subrogation claims
- [ ] Compile final case expense accounting

**Step 5.2 — Settlement Documentation**
- [ ] Draft Release Agreement (review scope carefully)
- [ ] Obtain client review and approval
- [ ] Secure court/guardian approval for minor settlements
- [ ] Draft Stipulation of Dismissal

**Step 5.3 — Lien Resolution**
- [ ] Negotiate final satisfaction amounts for all liens
- [ ] Satisfy Medicare/Medicaid recovery claims
- [ ] Resolve workers' comp and ERISA claims
- [ ] Obtain written lien satisfaction confirmations
- [ ] Resolve MedPay subrogation claims

**Step 5.4 — Payment Processing**
- [ ] Confirm receipt of settlement check
- [ ] Deposit to client trust account
- [ ] Verify funds cleared before disbursement
- [ ] Reconcile trust account

**Step 5.5 — Final Distribution**
- [ ] Prepare Settlement Disbursement Statement for client signature
- [ ] Issue client payment (net proceeds)
- [ ] Issue lienholder payments
- [ ] Issue firm expense reimbursement
- [ ] Calculate and transfer attorney fee
- [ ] Send case closure letter to client

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Pre-Submission Review
- [ ] Demand letter is 3–5 pages (concise, not verbose)
- [ ] All factual claims supported by attached documentation

|---------|--------|
| Adjuster non-response > 30 days | Escalate for supervisor contact or suit evaluation |
| Offer < 50% of documented specials | Escalate for litigation evaluation |
| Bad faith indicators present | Escalate immediately for Hartford letter preparation |
| Medicare beneficiary settlement | Escalate for MSA consultation |
| Settlement involves minors | Escalate for court approval process |
| Policy limits may be insufficient | Escalate for UM/UIM and excess coverage analysis |

## Quick Reference: Key Strategic Concepts

### Reserve Anchoring
> "Front-load the demand package with significant documentation—such as early surgical bills or specialist reports—to anchor the initial reserve at a higher, more realistic amount."

### Colossus Limitations
- Only considers first **60 factors** listed
- Maximum **7 diagnoses** per claim
- Data entry accuracy reportedly **0%**
- Filing suit **removes claim from Colossus** entirely

### Year-End Settlement Window
> "Claims often settle for higher amounts around Thanksgiving and Christmas as insurers and adjusters aim to clear out financial reserves before the calendar year ends."

### Bad Faith Leverage
> "If an insurance company acts in bad faith—particularly by refusing to settle a claim within policy limits when liability is clear and damages obviously exceed those limits—they risk becoming liable for damages beyond the policy limits."

### Hartford Letter Purpose
A formal, time-limited settlement demand that:
1. Puts insurer on notice
2. Creates clear record
3. Becomes evidence for subsequent bad faith claim if excess verdict awarded
