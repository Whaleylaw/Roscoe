# Discovery & Evidence Development — AI Paralegal Operational Module

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Discovery & Evidence Development Management**

---

### Goal
Successfully manage all aspects of the discovery phase—from initial disclosures through expert coordination—resulting in:
- A complete, organized evidence repository with Bates-numbered documents
- Zero missed deadlines and fully documented discovery exchanges
- Well-prepared clients for depositions with documented prep sessions
- Structured data extracts (testimony highlights, expert opinions, contradiction logs)
- A defensible record of good-faith compliance and escalation protocols
- Early identification of red flags with timely attorney escalation

---

### When to Use
Activate this workflow when:
- A case enters the discovery phase following initial pleadings
- Written discovery (Interrogatories, RPDs, RFAs) is served or received
- A deposition is scheduled for a client, adverse party, or witness
- Expert witnesses require coordination, scheduling, or report management
- Social media or electronic evidence requires preservation or analysis
- Discovery disputes arise requiring documentation for potential Motion to Compel
- Any evidence-related deadline approaches within the calendaring window

---

### Inputs Required

| Input Category | Specific Items |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Case File** | Case number, parties, court, judge, key dates, claims/defenses |
| **Discovery Documents** | Interrogatories, RPDs, RFAs (incoming and outgoing), subpoenas |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **PHASE 1: Discovery Planning & Calendaring**

**Step 1.1 — Calendar All Deadlines**
- Upon receipt of any discovery request, immediately calendar the response deadline (typically 30 days from service date)
- Calculate backward from the deadline to set internal review milestones:
  - Attorney review: 7 days before deadline
  - Client meeting: 14 days before deadline
  - Document gathering: 21 days before deadline
- Enter all dates in the case management system with reminder alerts

**Step 1.2 — Track Outgoing Discovery**
- When serving discovery on opposing party, calendar their 30-day response deadline
- Set follow-up reminders at Day 25 and Day 31
- Document the date of service and method of service

**Step 1.3 — Attorney Notification Protocol**
- Generate automated notifications to supervising attorney for:
  - All new incoming discovery requests (within 24 hours)
  - Response deadlines (14 days, 7 days, 3 days before due)
  - Overdue opposing responses (1 day after deadline)
  - Any discovery anomalies or red flags (immediately)

---

#### **PHASE 2: Managing Written Discovery**

**Step 2.1 — Serving Discovery Requests**

*For Interrogatories:*
- Draft questions targeting factual information, witness identification, and basis for claims/defenses
- Use pattern interrogatories where available, customized to case specifics
- Review draft with attorney before finalizing
- Serve and log with date, method, and due date

*For Requests for Production (RPDs):*
- Draft requests targeting documents, ESI, photographs, and tangible items
- Include specific categories: medical records, insurance policies, communications, social media
- Serve and log with tracking number

*For Requests for Admissions (RFAs):*
- Draft statements to establish undisputed facts and authenticate documents
- Use strategically to narrow trial issues
- Serve and log with deadline

**Step 2.2 — Responding to Incoming Discovery**

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Calendar response deadline immediately | Day 0 |
| 2 | Schedule client meeting with attorney | Day 7-10 |
| 3 | Send document request list to client | Day 3-5 |
| 4 | Gather all responsive documents | Day 7-14 |
| 5 | Conduct privilege review | Day 14-21 |
| 6 | Draft responses with attorney input | Day 18-25 |
| 7 | Attorney final review | Day 25-28 |
| 8 | Serve responses | Day 28-30 |
| 9 | Log service and archive | Day 30 |

---

#### **PHASE 3: Document Organization & Production**

**Step 3.1 — Bates Stamping Protocol**
- Scan all documents (incoming and outgoing) at 300 DPI minimum
- Apply sequential Bates numbers using format: `[CASE_ID]-[PARTY]-[NUMBER]`
  - Example: `SMITH-PL-000001` through `SMITH-PL-001543`
- Maintain chronological order as received
- Create master index linking Bates ranges to document descriptions

**Step 3.2 — Privilege Log Creation**
For each document withheld on privilege grounds, document:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Bates Number | Assigned reference number |
| Date | Document date |
| Author | Creator of document |
| Recipients | All individuals copied |
| Description | General subject matter (without revealing privileged content) |
| Privilege Claimed | Attorney-Client / Work Product / Both |
| Basis | Specific grounds for claim |

**Step 3.3 — Document Production Log**
Maintain running log of all productions:
- Production date
- Producing party
- Bates range
- Document count (pages)
- Description of contents
- Method of production (electronic/physical)

---

#### **PHASE 4: Deposition Preparation & Management**

**Step 4.1 — Pre-Deposition Client Preparation**

*Schedule preparation session minimum 1 week before deposition (never morning of)*

**Preparation Session Checklist:**

☐ **Demystify the Process**
- Explain courtroom setup: court reporter, videographer positions
- Review roles: opposing counsel, your attorney, court reporter
- Discuss typical duration and break procedures

☐ **Review Prior Statements**
- Go through interrogatory answers line by line
- Review any prior statements, police reports, or medical history forms
- Identify and reconcile any inconsistencies

☐ **Document Review**
- Key medical records and treatment notes
- Incident documentation (photos, reports)
- Any documents likely to be used as exhibits

☐ **Teach the Four Cardinal Rules:**

| Rule | Instruction |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Tell the Truth** | "This is the paramount rule. You are under oath." |
| **2. Listen AND Understand** | "Do not answer a question you don't fully understand. Ask for clarification." |
| **3. Think Before Answering** | "Pause before responding. Formulate a complete, accurate answer." |
| **4. Answer Concisely** | "Answer only the question asked. If asked the time, give the time—don't explain how to build a clock." |

☐ **Role-Play Difficult Questions**
- Practice with anticipated challenging questions
- Reinforce rules during practice
- Address anxiety and normalize the experience

**Step 4.2 — Deposition Logistics**

| Task | Deadline | Responsible |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Confirm date/time/location with all parties | 2 weeks before | Paralegal |
| Schedule court reporter | 2 weeks before | Paralegal |
| Schedule videographer (recommended) | 2 weeks before | Paralegal |
| Test remote/Zoom technology (if applicable) | 3 days before | Paralegal |
| Prepare and organize exhibits | 1 week before | Paralegal |
| Prepare exhibit list for court reporter | 1 day before | Paralegal |
| Confirm client arrival time (30 min early) | 1 day before | Paralegal |

**Step 4.3 — Post-Deposition Protocol**

1. **Transcript Review**
   - Obtain transcript within agreed timeframe
   - Review meticulously for transcription errors
   - Note any AI transcription anomalies

2. **Create Deposition Summary**
   - Generate table of contents with page references
   - Extract and categorize:
     - Key admissions
     - Impeachment opportunities (contradictions)
     - New witnesses or facts revealed
     - Evasive or non-responsive answers

3. **Errata Sheet Management**
   - Explain errata sheet purpose to client: corrections to form or substance only
   - Review proposed changes with attorney before submission
   - Document all changes with reasons
   - Flag any material changes as potential red flags for opposing depositions

---

#### **PHASE 5: Expert Witness Coordination**

**Step 5.1 — Expert Engagement**
- Assemble comprehensive case file for expert review:
  - All relevant medical records
  - Deposition transcripts
  - Discovery responses
  - Photographs and imaging
  - Prior expert reports (if any)
- Execute engagement letter with scope and fee terms
- Document chain of custody for all materials provided

**Step 5.2 — Report Management**
- Calendar expert report deadlines per scheduling order
- Review draft reports for required elements:
  
  | Required Element | Example Language |
  |------------------|------------------|
  | Causation Opinion | "Within a reasonable degree of medical certainty..." |
  | Mechanism | "The collision caused / contributed to..." |
  | Prognosis | "The patient will require..." |
  | Future Treatment | "Future medical needs include..." |

- Ensure "magic language" appears: *"reasonable degree of medical certainty"* or *"medical probability"*
- Log expert opinions in structured database

**Step 5.3 — Expert Deposition Preparation**
- Coordinate expert availability for deposition
- Prepare expert for anticipated questions
- Discuss strategic considerations with attorney (note: sometimes opposing experts are not deposed to preserve cross-examination surprise)

---

#### **PHASE 6: Electronic & Social Media Evidence**

**Step 6.1 — Social Media Preservation**
- Issue immediate preservation instruction to client: **NO DELETION RULE**
  
  > ⚠️ **WARNING:** Advising a client to delete, alter, or hide social media content after litigation is foreseeable constitutes spoliation. This can result in:
  > - Court sanctions
  > - Adverse inference instructions
  > - Case dismissal
  > - Ethical violations imputed to supervising attorney

- Document current privacy settings (screenshot with metadata)
- Capture comprehensive screenshots of relevant posts
- Preserve metadata (timestamps, location data, engagement)
- Use forensic preservation tools where appropriate

**Step 6.2 — Authentication Preparation**
For all digital evidence, document:
- Source (platform, device, account)
- Collection method and date
- Chain of custody
- Metadata verification
- Witness who can authenticate (account owner, forensic expert)

**Step 6.3 — Video Deposition Considerations**
- Recommend video recording when:
  - Witness may be unavailable for trial
  - Deponent behavior is a concern
  - Impeachment value is high
- Video serves dual purpose: trial evidence + behavior management
- Ensure proper release and technical quality

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### **Privilege Protection Checklist**
☐ All outgoing documents reviewed for privilege before production
☐ Privilege log created for all withheld documents
☐ No privileged communications inadvertently included
☐ Work product materials segregated and marked
☐ Attorney-client communications protected

#### **Deadline Compliance Verification**
☐ All deadlines entered with triple-verification
☐ Backup reminders set at multiple intervals
☐ Attorney notification system functioning
☐ Extension requests filed before deadline expires (never after)

#### **Spoliation Prevention**
☐ Litigation hold issued and documented
☐ Client instructed on preservation obligations
☐ No Deletion Rule communicated in writing
☐ Social media preservation confirmed
☐ ESI preservation letter sent to opposing party (if applicable)

---

### Red Flags & Escalation Triggers

| Red Flag | Detection Method | Required Action |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Missed Deadline (Opposing)** | Calendar tracking | Confer with attorney re: Motion to Compel |
| **Inconsistent Testimony** | Deposition summary review | Document contradictions; flag for impeachment |
| **Social Media Contradictions** | Evidence cross-reference | Immediate attorney consultation |
| **Privilege Waiver by Opposition** | Discovery response analysis | Alert attorney to discovery opportunity |
| **Material Errata Changes** | Errata sheet review | Flag for attorney; potential re-deposition |
| **Spoliation Evidence** | Document/ESI review | URGENT: Immediate attorney escalation |
| **Expert Missing Magic Language** | Report review | Return to expert for revision |
| **Discovery Abuse Pattern** | Response pattern analysis | Document for court filing |

#### **Motion to Compel Protocol**
Before escalating to formal motion:
1. Document all informal resolution attempts (calls, emails)
2. Send formal meet-and-confer letter
3. Allow reasonable response time
4. Document continued non-compliance
5. Present complete record to attorney for motion decision

> **Note:** Judges disfavor discovery motions that signal lawyer disputes. Always exhaust informal options and document good-faith efforts.
