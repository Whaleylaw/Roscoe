## ATTORNEY'S FEES

### Post-Litigation Fee  
**{{LIT_PERCENTAGE}}%** (typically 40%) of the gross recovery if a lawsuit is filed, regardless of when settlement occurs thereafter.

### Appeal Fee
**{{APPEAL_PERCENTAGE}}%** (typically 45%) of the gross recovery if an appeal is necessary.

**"Gross recovery"** means the total amount received from all sources before deduction of any costs or expenses.
