**[SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD]{.underline}**

Summary judgment is appropriate when "'as a matter of law, it appears that it would be impossible for the respondent to produce evidence at the trial warranting a judgment in his favor and against the movant.'" [Steelvest, Inc. v. Scansteel Service Center, Inc.]{.underline}, 807 S.W.2d 476, 483 (Ky. 1991). In using the word "impossible," the Supreme Court of Kentucky acknowledged that it was being "used in a practical sense not an absolute sense." [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 828 S.W.2d 652, 654 (Ky. 1992). Moreover, the party opposing summary judgment "cannot rely on the hope that the trier of fact will disbelieve the movant's denial of a disputed fact, but must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." [Steelvest]{.underline}, 807 S.W.2d at 481 (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted).
