MOHAMED AMBURE PLAINTIFF

v\. **[PLAINTIFF MOHAMED AMBURE'S MEMORANDUM IN]{.underline}**

**[SUPPORT OF HIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT]{.underline}**

[COMPANY_NAME] CO. DEFENDANT

\* \* \* \* \* \*

For his Memorandum in Support of his Motion for Summary Judgment against Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], by and through counsel, states as follows:

**[UNDISPUTED FACTS]{.underline}**

The following facts are not in dispute and establish that the Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment against Defendant Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (hereinafter referred to as "Progressive").

This case involves a motor vehicle collision, which occurred on [DATE] in Louisville, Jefferson County, Kentucky. As a result of this motor vehicle collision, Mr. Ambure suffered injuries on and about his body. In accordance with the terms of his automobile insurance policy, Mr. Ambure contacted the Defendant and reported the collision; for which Defendant opened a claim identified as 12-2943813. Shortly thereafter, Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and submitted his medical bills for said treatment to Progressive. Progressive has denied payment for the Plaintiff's medical expenses, in the amount of \$7,327.00, to date.

Liability has been clear from the collision forward; the at-fault driver, Monique Black turned left, failing to yield to oncoming traffic, and struck Mr. Ambure's vehicle. (See Police Report, [Exhibit #)]{.mark} Ms. Black was insured through USAA, whom has already settled with Mr. Ambure. Mr. Ambure did nothing to cause this accident and his subsequent injuries, however Progressive still refuses, neglects, and fails to perform their duties as a reparation obligor.

Discovery thus far has conclusively established Progressive is the reparation obligor for Mohamed Ambure. In fact, their CR 30.02(6) designated Corporate Representative, Owen K. Caster, III, testified on behalf of Progressive during a deposition on [DATE] and affirmed that Progressive was aware of the subject collision of [DATE], that Progressive did not dispute that the Plaintiff was involved in the subject collision ([Exhibit \_\_\_]{.mark} 10:3 -- 10:15), and that Progressive is indeed the reparation obligor for Mohamed Ambure:

> Q: Now, did this accident involve a secured vehicle?
>
> A: This accident did involve a secured vehicle, yes.
>
> Q: And is there any dispute that the vehicle that Mr. Ambure was driving in was insured by Progressive was a secured vehicle under the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act?
>
> A: There is no dispute over that, no.
>
> Q: Now, does progressive agree that basic reparation benefits are to be paid without regard to fault?
>
> A: That's part of the Motor Vehicle Reparations Act, so yes.
>
> Q: That's why we call it no-fault insurance, right?
>
> A: Correct.

([Exhibit \_\_\_\_]{.mark} 10:16 -- 11:7); and in discussing Progressive's investigation process of this reported claim:

> Q: I want to be clear about any coverage investigation that you did related to this claim. Was there a question about coverage?
>
> A: There was a question about how the loss occurred, did it occur as it was reported. And so from the perspective there was that aspect of coverage. **There was no issue as far as the policy was in force at the time of the accident, the vehicle was** **on that policy. There was no question about that**. We just wanted to make sure the loss did occur as reported.
>
> ([Exhibit \_\_\_\_]{.mark} 43:20 -- 44:7)

As evidenced in Mr. Caster's deposition transcript wherein he testified on behalf of and for Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], Progressive does not dispute that they are the reparation obligor responsible for paying basic reparation benefits (hereinafter referred to as "BRB"), including medical expenses, for Mohamed Ambure. Nonetheless, they have completely denied him any and all BRB. Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

**[SUMMARY JUDGMENT STANDARD]{.underline}**

Summary judgment is appropriate when "'as a matter of law, it appears that it would be impossible for the respondent to produce evidence at the trial warranting a judgment in his favor and against the movant.'" [Steelvest, Inc. v. Scansteel Service Center, Inc.]{.underline}, 807 S.W.2d 476, 483 (Ky. 1991). In using the word "impossible," the Supreme Court of Kentucky acknowledged that it was being "used in a practical sense not an absolute sense." [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 828 S.W.2d 652, 654 (Ky. 1992). Moreover, the party opposing summary judgment "cannot rely on the hope that the trier of fact will disbelieve the movant's denial of a disputed fact, but must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment." [Steelvest]{.underline}, 807 S.W.2d at 481 (internal quotations omitted) (citation omitted).

**[LEGAL ARGUMENT]{.underline}**

On the facts set forth above, a rebuttable presumption of negligence has been established by the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Progressive has not provided any facts or arguments, which can counter that presumption. KRS 304.39-020(5)(a). In sum, the law presumes the medical expenses incurred by the Plaintiff' are reasonable and inasmuch as Progressive cannot rebut that presumption, judgment is properly entered for the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

Kentucky's Motor Vehicle Reparations Act ("MVRA"), also known as the No-Fault Act, was enacted to "create a comprehensive compulsory insurance system that requires owners to provide vehicle security covering basic reparation benefits and that imposes legal liability on vehicle owners for damages or injuries arising out of ownership of or use of the vehicle. KRS 304.39-010; KRS 304.39-080(5); [McGrew v. Stone]{.underline}, 998 S.W.2d 5, 6 (Ky. 1999). KRS 304.39-030(1) provides in pertinent part:

> If the accident causing injury occurs in this Commonwealth every person suffering loss from injury arising out of maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to basic reparation benefits, unless he has rejected the limitation upon his tort rights as provided in KRS 304.39-060(4).

Furthermore, KRS 304.39-060 states, in part:

> \(1\) Any person who registers, operates, maintains or uses a motor vehicle on the public roadways of this Commonwealth shall, as a condition of such registration, operation, maintenance or use of such motor vehicle and use of the public roadways, be deemed to have accepted the provisions of this subtitle, and in particular those provisions which are contained in this section.
>
> \(2\) (a) Tort liability with respect to accidents occurring in this Commonwealth and arising from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle is "abolished" for damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease to the extent the basic reparation benefits provided in this subtitle are payable therefor, or that would be payable but for any deductible authorized by this subtitle, under any insurance policy or other method of security complying with the requirements of this subtitle, except to the extent noneconomic detriment qualifies under paragraph (b) of this subsection.

With respect to the payment of BRB, KRS 304.39-050(1) provides that "\[t\]he basic reparation insurance applicable to bodily injury to which this subtitle applies is the security covering the vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident . . . ." Thus, the statutory language is unambiguous that the vehicle occupied by an injured person is responsible for the payment of BRB. Agreeing with this concept, a panel of the Kentucky Court of Appeals in [Rees v. USF&G]{.underline}, 715 S.W.2d 904, 906 (Ky. App. 1986) held:

> Unless he has rejected the limitation on his tort rights as provided in KRS 304.39-060(4), every person suffering loss from injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle has a right to basic reparation benefits. See KRS 304.39-030(1). The legislative policy as announced in KRS 304.39-050(1) is that the basic reparation insurance applicable to bodily injury" is the security covering the vehicle occupied by the injured person at the time of the accident." The "security covering the vehicle" in the present case is the policy written by USF&G, see KRS 304.39-080, which is, therefore, primarily liable for the payment of basic reparation benefits to the injured passenger. We have been referred to nothing in the MVRA which permits shifting the liability for the payment of basic reparation benefits as is the case with respect to the payment of tort liabilities. As a consequence, the policy written by USF&G must be interpreted to furnish primary coverage for basic reparation benefits to the injured passenger.

See KRS 304.39-100.

The plain language of KRS 304.39-020(5)(a) explicitly states that "\[t\]here shall be a presumption that any medical bill submitted is reasonable." According to long standing legal precedent in Kentucky, this Court's "duty is to ascertain and give effect to the intent" of the Legislature. [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME] of Education of Jefferson County]{.underline}, 873 S.W.2d 575, 577 (Ky. 1994). In so doing, this Court is directed to follow the clear language of the statute and when "plain and unambiguous" words are employed, we must apply those terms "without resort to any construction or interpretation." [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 907 S.W.2d 779, 782 (Ky. App. 1995). In sum, if this Court follows the legal principles of statutory interpretation it should find that KRS 304.39, and specifically KRS 304.39-020, to be clear on its face and not susceptible of interpretation-especially not the proposition that a reparation obligor can deny paying BRB without rebutting the statutory presumption.

KRS 304.39.210(1) provides that the reparation obligor must pay benefits monthly as the claimant's loss accrues. Loss accrues when medical expenses are incurred. These payments are considered overdue if not paid within thirty (30) days of the insurer's receipt of reasonable proof of the amount of loss. Noting that basic reparation benefits must be paid monthly and citing this statute, the Court of Appeals theorized in [State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co. v. Outlaw]{.underline}, 575 S.W.2d 489 (Ky. App. 1978), that \[a\]ssuming that Outlaw \[the claimant\] had filed a claim for benefits soon after the accident and that the assigned claims bureau had promptly assigned her claim to State Auto \[the reparation obligor\], State Auto would not have had any right to make any deduction for any future medical assistance payments. Id. at 494.

To date, Progressive has argued that it has not made any BRB payments for revolving reasons. First, they denied benefits while they investigated if the loss occurred as it was reported, as cited above. Secondly, more than 3 years and 4 months post-collision, they remain clung to their position that they are still investigating the medical bills and records for relativity, necessity, and reasonableness. Ultimately, as discussed in the following paragraphs, they further denied Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] was served upon them.

As to Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], liability has been clear from the date of collision, [DATE] forward. The Plaintiff timely filed his Personal Injury Protection (hereinafter, "PIP") application ([Exhibit #),]{.mark} containing the facts of how the loss occurred, this reporting of the collision matches the description contained in the Police Report ([Exhibit #)]{.mark}. Additionally, the at-fault driver, Monique Black whom was insured through USAA, quickly accepted liability and has already settled with Mr. Ambure. Furthermore, Progressive's designated corporate representative testified as to his decision, only 3 months after this accident, not to pursue an examination under oath:

> A: And my involvement in the claim came when, as I say, SIU \[Special Investigations Unit\] had got to a point in their investigation where they wanted to ask, do you want to get an examination under oath, and I said no.

Q: Why did you decide that?

> A: I felt like based on the information that they had compiled that there wasn't an overwhelming or compelling item of information that would warrant asking Mr. Ambure to attend an examination under oath.
>
> Q: So then you said that you made that decision and you said let's move forward and see what we owe.
>
> A: Yes.

([Exhibit \_\_\_\_]{.mark} 44:8 -44:22)

Having no question remaining as to the accuracy of the loss as reported, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] is based on their pending investigation of the reasonableness, necessity, and relativity of the medical treatment and bills. ([See Exhibit \_\_\_\_]{.mark} 41:6 -- 42:5; and 53:24 -- 56:2) Mr. Ambure timely submitted his medical bills to Progressive, a copy of which are attached hereto as [Exhibit "#."]{.mark} However, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], neglected, and failed to pay any portion of these bills in violation of the KMVRA. Furthermore \*\*\*\*NOT and MD...

Again, according to KRS 304.39-020(5)(a), it is presumed that any medical bill submitted

is reasonable. [See also]{.underline} [Outlaw]{.underline}, 575 S.W.2d at 493. Further, the submission of actual medical bills in connection with a motor vehicle collision has been conclusively found to satisfy the statutory requirement of reasonable proof of the fact and amount of the loss realized. [Id.]{.underline} The Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and submitted his medical bills to Progressive, is enough to satisfy his burden to provide reasonable proof in accordance with the laws of this Commonwealth. Progressive does not dispute they are in receipt of the medical bills from the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], contradicts this assertion. According to statute, these bills were to be paid within thirty (30) days, and Progressive neglected to do so; therefore, the payments are overdue. KRS 304.39-210(3) unequivocally mandates that the reparation obligor, in this case Progressive, must timely pay the claimant as his loss accrues.

Furthermore, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], as evidenced in the Explanation of Benefits (hereinafter, "EOB") documents annexed as [Exhibit \#]{.mark}, by either failing to provide any explanation (also see [Exhibit \_\_\_\_]{.mark} 91:8 -- 94:2; and 94:25 -- 96:11; and 97:12 -- 97:24; and 98:20 -- 99:12) where the EOB references for the reason BRB payment has not been made, "see Comments Section" however, there are no comments associated with the EOB, that section is blank. Therein, Progressive fails to provide a reason to Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. The only other reason Progressive disclosed to Mr. Ambure for nonpayment of BRB is, "Claims Pending due to Litigation" (see [Exhibit \_\_\_]{.mark} 94:8 -- 94:19; and 98:5 -- 98:14; and 99:18 -- 100:7; and 101:1 -- 101:5). Litigation pending is not a lawful reason to deny paying BRB to a basic reparation insured whom Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] was operating a secured vehicle, covered under their own policy of which they received premiums from Plaintiff.

Defendants deadline to identify an expert witness expired on January 1^st^, 2016 pursuant to the Trial Order entered in this matter on [DATE]. Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Without a qualified expert to opine as to the reasonableness, necessity and whether or not Mr. Ambure's injuries are related to subject collision, they cannot speak to causation. Defendants cannot prove \*\*\*

[Against this backdrop of law, the only questions this Court needs to decide are: 1) whether the Plaintiff fulfilled their obligation to provide Progressive with reasonable proof of their losses; and 2) if so, whether Progressive had a reasonable foundation for denying and/or delaying payment of those claims.]{.mark} Progressive's failure to comport with the requirements of the KMVRA is thus, inexcusable and without foundation.

[As to the second issue before the Court]{.mark}, Progressive can only avoid the penalties of interest and attorney's fees for its denial to pay Plaintiff' BRB if it can show it had a reasonable foundation for delaying and/or denying payment of the claim. [Automobile Club Insurance Co. v. Lainhar]{.underline}t, 609 S.W.2d 692, 694 (Ky. App. 1980). It cannot do so. A reasonable foundation for delay can only be established by an "assertion of a legitimate and bona fide defense by the reparation obligor" or by proof the claimant failed to provide the obligor with reasonable proof of loss in a timely fashion. [Id.]{.underline} at 695; [see also [PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 603 S.W.2d 498, 499 (Ky. App. 1980); [Outlaw]{.underline}, 575 S.W.2d at 494-495.

In this instance, Progressive has not provided a single reason or support for its denial of payment of Plaintiff's medical bills or one that could be found to constitute a reasonable foundation to delay and/or deny payment. Progressive was in receipt of Plaintiff's medical bills shortly after the motor vehicle collision at issue and was aware of their obligations under the KMVRA. Progressive has not provided a scintilla of evidence to refute the statutory presumption of the reasonableness of Plaintiff's medical bills, the reasonableness or necessity of Plaintiff's medical treatment, or anything to show that it did not receive Plaintiff's medical bills. In sum, Progressive is not legally permitted to delay and/or deny payment of timely submitted claims by the Plaintiff. Once Progressive received reasonable proof of loss, it was their statutory obligation to pay the Plaintiff's claims within thirty (30) days.

For these reasons, and those stated herein, this Court should find that Progressive is obligated to pay all Plaintiff's medical expenses to date, that Progressive's delay and/or denial of payment was unsupported and/or without reasonable foundation, and award Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], attorney's fees in the amount of \$[4,000.00]{.mark} for pursuing Plaintiff's rights under the KMVRA, and 18% interest on all money owed to Plaintiff' medical providers under the KMVRA, from the first date of Progressive's denial.

**[CONCLUSION]{.underline}**
