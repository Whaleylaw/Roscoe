\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Please take notice that the undersigned will, on [Monday, January #, 201]{.mark}6 at the hour of 11:15 a.m. in the Courtroom of the above Court, make the Motion and tender the Order set forth below.

**PLAINTIFF'S** **MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE "iDRIVE" DATA**

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and Davanisha Faulkner, by counsel, moves this Court to exclude certain undisclosed "iDrive" data for which no qualified expert is expected to testify.

**INTRODUCTION**

This is an injury case in which Plaintiffs were traveling northbound on I-65 on the 13^th^ of February 2014, when their vehicle was struck by a driver of Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. of Louisville ("Yellow Cab"). Yellow Cab has refused to admit the vehicular impact occurred, denying Plaintiff's claims. Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], has shadowed Yellow Cab's denials and has refused to make basic reparation benefits to the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], data from on-board recording system, "iDrive," that denies the collision with Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. However, neither Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], which is improper for the reasons set forth herein.

The camera and recording system installed on the taxi is an automatic system, not operated by the driver or any other person. Furthermore, this is an untested system and the camera directly concerning this incident was never tested for accuracy. Please see Exhibit B, deposition transcript of Joseph Fowler, 19:12-20:24; 21:3-21:13; 23:13-24:18; 33:15-33:24; 34:2-34:11 and 58:18-58:25. Therefore, no percipient witness exists to testify and authenticate this recording.

> **STANDARD**

Due to the technical and scientific operation of the iDrive system, a qualified expert would be required to provide foundational testimony to satisfy KRE 901(b)(9) which requires authentication of a process or system, when "\[e\]vidence describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the process or system produces an accurate result." The iDrive recording system used by Yellow Cab would therefore require the testimony of a qualified expert witness to explain, in detail, to the jury how the system works, how reliable the system is, if the system is tested for accuracy, or if the results are assumed always accurate, and to otherwise identify the system and authenticate its reported findings as they relate to this incident. A lay witness would be barred from providing testimony concerning this data under KRE 701(c), as an expert would be required due to the scientific and technical nature of the system of the unauthenticated recording. Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and meet the authentication requirement of KRE 901, therefore the iDrive recording system data is not sufficient to be admissible evidence.

On [DATE], Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], requested leave of court to name their own expert witnesses. Neither of those proposed experts are expected to testify regarding the iDrive recording system or its data. However, Grange reserves, "any and all video footage from the iDrive recording system of the Yellow Cab..." in their Exhibit List, filed the same day. Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

**ARGUMENT**

> **iDrive recording system is technical or scientific data which cannot be presented to a jury lacking a qualified expert to testify in regards to the process, system, findings and result.**

If technical or scientific data is allowed to presented to the jury it must be explained by an expert, and that expert must meet certain criteria. Regarding the qualifications of expert required, it is widely understood that KRE 702 allows an expert to testify if: (1) The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) The witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. Expert testimony is not admissible unless the expert is qualified and the opinion is scientifically valid and methodologically sound. [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Pahrs., Inc.]{.underline}, 509 U.S. 579, 592-593 (1993). KRE 702 is an "assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue." [Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Thompson]{.underline}, 11 S.W.3d 575, 581 (Ky. 2000) citing [Daubert]{.underline}*,* 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. at 2796, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482. Also, "We observe, however, that two of the primary criteria suggested in *Daubert* to determine scientific reliability are whether the principle is subject to falsifiability and whether the known or potential error rate has been evaluated." [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 937 S.W.2d 690 S.Ct. (Ky. 1996) citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-594, 113 S.Ct. at 2797, 125 L.Ed.2d at 483. Under the same standards, this type of evidence must be presented to the jury by an expert who can testify concerning the process, system, findings, results, reliability, and accuracy of the iDrive recording system. As no such expert has been identified or disclosed by either Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

**CONCLUSION**

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] is unreliable, unsupported by the facts, unsupported by scientific expert testimony, and is an unauthenticated recording. Accordingly, the iDrive recording system data must be excluded from exhibits and not presented to the jury because it fails to satisfy KRE 901, and would require an expert meeting the criteria set forth in KRE 702 and [Daubert]{.underline}, and which is lacking.
