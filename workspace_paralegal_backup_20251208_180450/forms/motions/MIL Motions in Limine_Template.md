JUDGE CHARLES L. CUNNINGHAM

JASON T. FISHER PLAINTIFF

v\. **Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. FISHER'S MOTIONS IN LIMINE**

OMAR N. MOHAMED DEFENDANT

\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*

Comes now, the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], by and through counsel and moves this Court for an Order in *Limine* precluding the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], directly, indirectly, or in any manner whatsoever, the matters set forth below:

**1. The Kentucky Uniform Police Traffic Collision Report.**

Uniform police traffic collision reports are inadmissible under Kentucky law. KRE 803(8)(A); *see also [PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]*, 426 S.W.2d 431, 438 (Ky. 1968). Therefore, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

**2. Challenges to the Necessity or Reasonableness of Plaintiffs' Medical Bills.**

In all motor vehicle accident cases, "\[t\]here shall be a presumption that any medical bill submitted is reasonable." KRS 304.39-020(5)(a). To overcome this statutory presumption, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME],* 580 S.W.2d 490 (Ky. 1979) ("Under such circumstances the probative force of the medical bills is so persuasive on the issue of the reasonableness of the amount of charges for 'medical expense' that there is nothing for the jury to decide and the issue should not \[be\] submitted to them.") In *Bolin*, which also involved an automobile accident, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], but furnished no evidence to impeach the charges for such treatment. The Kentucky Supreme Court held that a jury should not be asked to decide whether medical expenses are reasonable or necessary in absence of evidence to rebut the statutory presumption of reasonableness. Here, the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. However, under the above authority, without impeachment evidence, the Court must presume Plaintiffs' medical bills are necessary and reasonable.

**3. Challenges Regarding the Cause or Extent of Plaintiffs' Injuries.**

The Court should exclude all testimony, arguments, or opinions offered by lay witnesses or Defendants' attorneys regarding the cause or extent of Plaintiffs' injuries. Specifically, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], or that Plaintiffs' injuries are not as severe as they claim. Such medical testimony is solely within the purview of a biomechanical or medical expert, which Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

KRE 701(c) prohibits any lay witness from offering opinion testimony "based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702." Any testimony, argument, or opinion that the subject accident was not the medical cause of Plaintiffs' injuries must be based solely upon scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge which only an expert qualified under KRE 702 may offer. The need for such expert testimony is particularly important in this case, where Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] by the subject accident or are not as severe as Plaintiff's doctors opine.

Similarly, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Such testimony may only be properly given by an expert. Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] are not licensed to practice medicine and are not qualified

to render a diagnosis. Therefore, they obviously are not qualified to render a medical assessment as to Plaintiffs' medical diagnosis or prognosis, or to attempt to educate a jury on such matters.

**4. Defendants' Remorse or Other Post-Injury State of Mind.**

The Court should exclude all reference, mention, argument, or evidence of Defendants' remorse, or that they are sorry, regretful, or apologetic for the subject accident or for Plaintiffs' injuries.

The only factual questions before the Court are: (1) whether the Defendants were negligent; (2) whether such negligence caused Plaintiffs' injuries; and (3) the value of Plaintiffs' injuries. Defendants' remorse or similar post-injury state of mind has *no* tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of such questions more probable or less probable. Thus, such evidence is inadmissible under KRE 402.

In addition to being irrelevant, any evidence of Defendants' remorse or other post-injury state of mind would risk causing prejudice, confusion of the issues, and misleading the jury as to the appropriate legal measure of damages. Accordingly, admission of such evidence is also prohibited under KRE 403.

**5. Collateral Source Payments.**

The existence of any collateral source payments made in connection with the care and treatment of Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and inadmissible. KRE 401; KRE 402; *O'[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]*, 892 S.W.2d 571 (Ky. 1995). Accordingly, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] by the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and any health insurance company.

6\. **Facts not in evidence.**

It is expected that defense counsel will attempt to argue facts not in evidence to the jury. Plaintiff requests the court enter an order in *limine* instructing defense counsel not to argue facts not in evidence.

**7. Miscellaneous Irrelevant and/or Prejudicial Matters.**

> \(a\) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].
>
> \(b\) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].
>
> \(c\) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], how, or why Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], or the circumstances under which Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].
>
> \(d\) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

**8. That the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] by a preponderance of the evidence.**

The rule in Kentucky is that a jury should not be told... "that a litigant must prove his or her case by a preponderance of the evidence." *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME] by Greene* 709 S.W.2d 850, 852 (Ky. 1986); see also, *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME],* 906 S.W.2d 356, 357 (Ky. 1995); 2 Palmore, *Kentucky Instructions to Juries,* §13.11(f)(2009). Accordingly, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], suggestion or argument directed toward Plaintiff's burden of proof.
