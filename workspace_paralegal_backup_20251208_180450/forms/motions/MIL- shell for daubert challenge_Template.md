BRANDON BOYD Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. **NOTICE-MOTION-ORDER**

RUSSEL APARTMENTS, et al. DEFENDANTS

\* \* \* \* \* \* \* \* \*

Please take notice that the undersigned will, on [Thursday, September 18, 201]{.mark}6 at the hour of [9:30]{.mark} a.m. in the Courtroom of the above Court, make the Motion and tender the Order set forth below.

**PLAINTIFF'S** **MOTION IN LIMINE TO EXCLUDE TESTIMONY OF Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. HOWARD L. CASTON, Ph.D.**

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], by counsel, moves this Court to exclude unsupported factual conclusions of Defednant's proposed expert Dr. Howard L. Caston, Ph.D.

**INTRODUCTION**

This is an injury case in which Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], negligently failed to maintain the apartment, specifically the balcony, leased to Third-Party Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], of whom Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], was an invited guest at the time of this incident. Due to the failures and negligence of Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Mr. Boyd suffered serious injuries that have included: medical expenses of at least, or over \$191,171.38; permanent impairment; scaring and permanent disfigurement; a loss of power to labor and earn money; substantial pain and suffering, as well as future medical expenses.

**FACTS**

On [DATE], Brandon Boyd was invited guest visiting his friend, Leonard Curry who was the tenant of unit: 103 East Saint Catherine Street, Apartment 4, [CITY], Kentucky [ZIP_CODE], leased by Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. The unit leased to Mr. Curry is a second-story apartment home with a balcony. Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], only after the injury to Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], have stated the balcony is not to be used and is simply there for decoration. Defendants then brought a Third-Party Complaint against their former tenant, Leonard Curry, to further avoid their responsibilities and duties prescribed under the law. Only after the injury occurred Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], made the first indication to their tenant, Leonard Curry, that he was not to use the balcony of his apartment. Unfortunately, this late action on Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] was an improper way of creating a rule or regulation after the signing of the lease that does not conform with [KRS #####.]{.mark}

Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], throughout this suit have argued that they have no duty to maintain the balcony in question because it was only a decorative feature, in their opinion, and never was intended to be used by their tenants. Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], contends that [Kentucky law]{.mark} requires landlords to maintain the entire leased premises, including decorative features. The condition of the balcony on the day of the injury to Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], was a state of disrepair and deterioration. Photographs showing the rotten, deteriorating wood are annexed herewith as Exhibit [#.]{.mark}

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], has testified that when visiting his friend, Leonard Curry, in his apartment leased by Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], he regularly and routinely accessed the balcony affixed to the apartment by climbing out a bedroom window. ([CITE depo transcript.)]{.mark} Further, Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Curry kept milk crates and various items on the balcony for the purpose of sitting on them during the many times the balcony was used. These items would have been visible from the ground to any passerby, including the Defendants who testified they performed visual inspections of the premises "a\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* ([CITE Bridgette Johnson Depo]{.mark})

Furthermore, [Kentucky law]{.mark} requires that a bedroom have 2 means of egress. Without the balcony access, the apartment leased by Defendants and Third-Party Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], to Third-Party Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], is not a legal or sufficient dwelling.

> **STANDARD**

KRE 702 Testimony by experts allows an expert to testify if: (1) The testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data; (2) The testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (3) The witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. Expert testimony is not admissible unless the expert is qualified and the opinion is scientifically valid and methodologically sound. [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Pahrs., Inc.]{.underline}, 509 U.S. 579, 592-593 (1993). Under [Daubert*,*]{.underline} the trial court has a gatekeeper function which requires an assessment of the admissibility of expert testimony. Specifically, the court is to determine "whether the expert\'s testimony reflects 'scientific knowledge,' whether their findings are 'derived by the scientific method,' and whether their work product amounts to 'good science.'" 43 F.3d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir.1995) (on remand), *quoting,* [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME], Inc.]{.underline}, 509 U.S. 579, 593, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). An expert's subjective belief or unsupported speculation do not satisfy the principles of admissible expert testimony. [[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]]{.underline}, 37 F.Supp.2d 959, 961 (W.D. Kentucky)

**ARGUMENT**

> **Dr. Sawyer's opinions about the amount of alcohol consumed by Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] are unreliable and unsupported speculation.**

Expert testimony that is unreliable must be excluded. [Daubert]{.underline}, 509 U.S. at 589. Pursuant to KRE 104 and KRE 702, the trial court must determine whether Dr. Sawyer's opinions are reliable, and thus, admissible, as evidence in the case. The central inquiry into the admissibility of testimony pursuant to FRE 702 (identical to KRE 702) is an "assessment of whether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid and of whether that reasoning or methodology properly can be applied to the facts in issue." [Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Thompson]{.underline}, 11 S.W.3d 575, 581 (Ky. 2000) citing [Daubert]{.underline}*,* 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. at 2796, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482.

In this case, Dr. Sawyer has submitted an opinion that Defendant Shrewsbury consumed more than one-to-three beers at Rene Ryan's house when there is no witness testimony to support this conclusion. Instead, this is pure speculative testimony. Dr. Sawyer attempts to support his conclusion based on witness testimony that Defendant Shrewsbury did not appear intoxicated; however, this directly contradicts Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] was intoxicated upon leaving Asiatique. Further, Dr. Sawyer has not performed any scientific test to conclude that Defendant Shrewsbury must have consumed more than one-to-three drinks at Rene Ryan's house. In sum, Dr. Sawyer reasoning directly contradicts the facts of this case and is therefore unreliable.

**CONCLUSION**

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Sawyer from testifying that Rene Ryan must have consumed more than one-to-three drinks while at Rene Ryan's house because it is unreliable, unsupported by the facts, and unsupported by scientific evidence. Accordingly, this testimony must be excluded because fails to satisfy KRE 702 and [Daubert]{.underline}.
