# NEGOTIATION AGREEMENT
*(Authorization to Negotiate Settlement)*

I, **{{CLIENT_NAME}}**, spoke with my case manager at The Whaley Law Firm on **{{TODAY_LONG}}** and was advised of the 1st offer from the Defendant's insurance carrier, **{{INSURANCE_CARRIER}}**, in the amount of **${{INITIAL_OFFER}}**.

The Whaley Law Firm has advised me that this offer is exclusive of the PIP Benefits I may have received.

## Understanding & Acknowledgment

I have been advised and understand:

1. **Settlement Amount:** The final settlement amount is a lump sum amount comprised of allotments toward all claims for recovery up to and including my attorney fees and expenses, lost wages, outstanding medical bills, and any legal lending funds plus interest that I have received.

2. **PIP Reimbursement:** The PIP Benefits issued to me from my insurance carrier are due to be reimbursed by the Defendant's insurance carrier. Any medical bills in excess of the entitled PIP Benefits are my sole responsibility. These medical bills can be submitted to my private health insurance carrier IF I have provided The Whaley Law Firm copies of my current health insurance cards for processing. If I do not have current or have insufficient health insurance coverage, I understand the outstanding balances can be deducted from my settlement and directed to my medical providers.

3. **Legal Lending:** IF I have received any legal lending funds from companies such as Capital Now Funding, Oasis or Barrister Loans, I am contracted to reimburse these companies for the monies received plus the agreed upon interest from any settlement recovered and authorize The Whaley Law Firm to deduct these funds from the agreed upon settlement after my attorney fees have been deducted.

4. **Final Offer:** The Whaley Law Firm has assured me that I will be contacted upon receipt of the Last, Best, Final Offer on my claim and they will discuss this offer in detail with me before acceptance is given. I understand The Whaley Law Firm cannot guarantee any recovery until I accept a Final Offer.

5. **Litigation:** I understand denial of any reasonable and fair offer can result in delays of my settlement and can cause my claim to go into litigation. I further understand not all claims are suitable for litigation and these points will be discussed with me prior to litigation being filed on my behalf.
