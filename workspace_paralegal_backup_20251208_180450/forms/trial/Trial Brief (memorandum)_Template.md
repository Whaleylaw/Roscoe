v\. **TRIAL MEMORANDUM**

YELLOW CAB CO. OF LOUISVILLE, LLC and [COMPANY_NAME] COMPANY

\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and Davanisha Faulkner, by and through counsel, herein submit this memorandum pursuant to the Civil Jury Trial Order of [DATE] stating the following:

**INTRODUCTION**

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], Yellow Cab Company of Louisville, LLC, ("Yellow Cab") and Grange Property & Casualty Insurance Co., ("Grange") on [DATE] and through their counsel have made good faith effort to resolve this controversy, however issues remain of which a jury may decide.

**FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW**

On [DATE], Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] was operating a silver 2002 Toyota Camry, he and Plaintiff, Davinsha Faulkner were traveling northbound on I-65 near Grade Lane when a Yellow Cab vehicle attempted to merge into their lane, and struck their vehicle. Immediately after smashing into Plaintiff's rear passenger end, the operator of the Yellow Cab vehicle fled the scene, but not before Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. (Please see Police Report, Exhibit A.) Plaintiff's called emergency 911 operators for police assistance while they followed the Yellow Cab driver to the Kentucky Fairgrounds vicinity until the 911 operator instructed them to wait for the officer in route. (Exhibit B: deposition transcript of Steven Gaines 33:13-34:17; and Exhibit C: 911 Audio on disc.) Through the identifying license plate, the investigating officer was able to determine the VIN number of the corresponding Yellow Cab vehicle, which he found to have minor damage to its left front bumper. (Exhibit A: page 3.) The damage to both vehicles is consistent with the circumstances of the collision and is evidenced in the photographs (Exhibit D), despite Yellow Cab denying the collision occurred. Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and damages due to Yellow Cab's negligence.

Despite reasonable proof of injuries, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], failed, and neglected to pay any portion of the medical expenses incurred by Plaintiffs, in violation of KRS § 304.39-210 (Exhibit E). Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], denying Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], forced Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and incur additional damages.

There is no proof offered by Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], to show the medical expenses were unreasonable or unnecessary, therefore there is no reasonable foundation existing for Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME],* Ky., 701 S.W.2d 139 (1986). In *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME],* 580 S.W.2d 490 (Ky. 1979) the Kentucky Supreme Court interpreted KRS § 304.39-020 (with Exhibit E) and affirmed the statutory presumption that submitted medical expenses are reasonable. Grange's refusal to pay medical expenses without a reasonable foundation warrants 18% interest on damages plus an award of reasonable attorney's fees and costs for the Plaintiffs. *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]*, Ky., App. 609 S.W.2d 692 (1980) and *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]*, Ky., App. 575 S.W.2d 489 (1978).

Respectfully submitted,
