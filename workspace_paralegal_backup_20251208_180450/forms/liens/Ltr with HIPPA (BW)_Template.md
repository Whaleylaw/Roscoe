Dear Ms. Savage,

Our medical records requesting team is having difficulty with one of your health providers refusing to accept the HIPPA compliant medical release your mother signed on your behalf when you were a minor; now that you are an adult they demand that you execute a new medical release, enclosed herewith. Please sign and return this document to Brenda Wood in our office using the enclosed pre-paid envelope. Thank you for your time and attention

Very truly yours,
