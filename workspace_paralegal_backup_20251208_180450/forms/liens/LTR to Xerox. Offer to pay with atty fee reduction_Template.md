Dear Ms. Papa,

I am in receipt of your lien statement dated [DATE] totaling \$499.42. Our clients last date of treatment for injuries related to the [DATE] DOL was [DATE] and there will be no future treatment. As you are aware, you have no subrogation rights without our efforts; accordingly, I am requesting a **25%** reduction for our attorney fees in seeking and obtaining a recovery for these injuries. With this reduction applied, I calculate this lien to be: \$374.56, of which I am willing to make an offer to pay. **Please confirm that \$374.56 will satisfy Passport Health Plan's lien in full, and said payment will be rendered.** Thank you for your time and attention.

Very truly yours
