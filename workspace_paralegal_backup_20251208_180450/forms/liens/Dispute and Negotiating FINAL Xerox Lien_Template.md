**REQUEST FOR FINAL ITEMIZED LIEN WITH REDUCTION**

**FOR ATTORNEY'S FEES AND REDUCTION FOR DISPUTED CHARGES**

Dear Ms. Pate:

We recently spoke about this lien in our office's attempts to obtain your final lien amount for our above referenced client. As discussed, there is not dispute to your lien of \$110.48 as noticed by you December 4^,^ 2015. Those charges do appear related to the above referenced injury matter.

However, your recent lien of [DATE] includes three additional charges of which are in dispute. These medical charges, as coded, appear to be digestive and tooth related, and are not related to the injuries he sustained to his head, arm and right shoulder on [DATE].

Accordingly, I respectfully request that you remove the charges for Dates of Service January 6^th^ and 8^th^ of 2016; highlighted in the attached. If you have information to show these charges are related to the above Date of Loss, please provide the same in written response.

Without these disputed and unrelated charges, your lien is calculated to be \$147.50. Factoring a 25% reduction for attorney fees brings this particular lien to **\$110.62**, for which we will issue payment upon your written agreement this amount will satisfy your client's final lien. Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Very truly yours,

Celia Hibben
