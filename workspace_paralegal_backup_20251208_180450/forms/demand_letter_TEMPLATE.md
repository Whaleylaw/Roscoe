## 3. DAMAGES

### 3.1. Total Projected Claim Value

| Elements of Damages | Amount |
|---------------------|--------|
| Past Medical Expenses | $[PAST_MEDICALS] |
| Future Medical Expenses | $[FUTURE_MEDICALS] |
| Loss of Earnings | $[LOST_EARNINGS] |
| Loss of Household Services | $[HOUSEHOLD_SERVICES] |
| Past and Future Pain and Suffering | $[PAIN_SUFFERING] |
| **Total Damages** | **$[TOTAL_DAMAGES]** |

### 3.2. Past Medical Expenses

[CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has incurred medical costs of **$[PAST_MEDICALS_TOTAL]** to date.

| Provider | Date of Service | Amount Charged | Amount Accepted | Supporting Document(s) |
|----------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| [PROVIDER_1] | [DATE_RANGE_1] | $[CHARGED_1] | $[ACCEPTED_1] | Exhibit [#] |
| [PROVIDER_2] | [DATE_RANGE_2] | $[CHARGED_2] | $[ACCEPTED_2] | Exhibit [#] |
| [ADD_MORE_PROVIDERS] | [DATE_RANGE_N] | $[CHARGED_N] | $[ACCEPTED_N] | Exhibit [#] |
| **Total** | | **$[TOTAL_CHARGED]** | **$[TOTAL_ACCEPTED]** | |

If you claim any of the medical treatment was unnecessary or any of the bills were unreasonable, please identify in writing which bills you dispute and the factual basis for such dispute. If you dispute them with a qualified expert opinion from a doctor willing to testify, then please provide us with a copy of his or her report. If not, please confirm in writing that you dispute the bills as an adjuster and not a qualified medical professional. If you do not respond in writing to this report, we will assume you do not dispute the amount of medical bills.

### 3.3. Future Medical Expenses

[CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] continues to experience pain and symptomatology as a result of the injuries sustained in the incident at issue and will require additional treatment moving forward, including, but not limited to, [LIST_FUTURE_TREATMENTS]. Thus, a conservative estimate of future medical care for [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] is **$[FUTURE_MEDICALS_TOTAL]**.

| Procedure | Years | #/Year | Cost | Total |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|-------|
| [PROCEDURE_1] | [YEARS] | [VISITS_PER_YEAR] | $[COST_PER_VISIT] | $[SUBTOTAL_1] |
| [PROCEDURE_2] | [YEARS] | [VISITS_PER_YEAR] | $[COST_PER_VISIT] | $[SUBTOTAL_2] |
| **Total** | | | | **$[FUTURE_MEDICALS_TOTAL]** |

[CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has a life expectancy of [LIFE_EXPECTANCY] years and has suffered permanent injuries as a direct result of the [INCIDENT_TYPE] on [INCIDENT_DATE], that will require treatment for the remainder of [his/her/their] life.

Note that the costs of healthcare and medication will continue to rise significantly, and we reserve the right to revise our projection of future medicals on this basis, among others. We also note that this estimate could readily be augmented for additional years and types of medical treatments. The costs listed above do not account for the potential surgeries that may be required in the future.

### 3.4. Loss of Earnings

As a result of the incident at issue, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has a loss of earning capacity totaling **$[LOST_EARNINGS_TOTAL]** when [he/she/they] [was/were] unable to work due to [his/her/their] injuries. At the time of the incident, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] earned a median annual salary of $[ANNUAL_SALARY] as a [OCCUPATION].[FOOTNOTE] [He/She/They] has not been able to return to [his/her/their] employment since the [INCIDENT_DATE], incident.

[OPTIONAL: INSERT WORKLIFE PROBABILITY TABLE OR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS]

### 3.5. Loss of Household Services

As a result of the incident, we estimate that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has been unable to contribute **$[HOUSEHOLD_SERVICES_TOTAL]** in labor in the form of past and future household services. Our calculation rests on three variables:

1. Before [his/her/their] incident, we assume that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] contributed an average of [HOURS_PER_DAY] hours of household chores per day to the household, in line with the average contribution of persons of similar age and gender in America.

2. We assume that the monetary value of [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME]'s labor is consistent with the average housekeeping salary of $[HOURLY_RATE] an hour in the State of [STATE], as estimated from the [SOURCE_DATE] report on Occupational Employment and Wages by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

3. In our estimation, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] suffered a [INITIAL_IMPAIRMENT_%]% impairment from contributing to household chores through [END_DATE_INITIAL_PERIOD], and will continue to experience an ongoing impairment of [ONGOING_IMPAIRMENT_%]% for the remaining [REMAINING_YEARS] years of [his/her/their] life expectancy.

Assuming no further impairment of household chores after [FINAL_DATE], solely for simplicity and convenience of early settlement, we calculate the value of loss of household services between [START_DATE] and [FINAL_DATE], at **$[HOUSEHOLD_SERVICES_TOTAL]**.

#### Loss of Household Services Schedule

| Start of Loss Date | End of Loss Date | Hourly Rate | Hours Per Day | % Impaired | Net Loss |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| [START_1] | [END_1] | $[RATE_1] | [HOURS_1] | [PCT_1]% | $[LOSS_1] |
| [START_2] | [END_2] | $[RATE_2] | [HOURS_2] | [PCT_2]% | $[LOSS_2] |
| [ADD_MORE_PERIODS] | [END_N] | $[RATE_N] | [HOURS_N] | [PCT_N]% | $[LOSS_N] |
| **Total Loss of Household Services** | | | | | **$[HOUSEHOLD_SERVICES_TOTAL]** |

### 3.6. Past and Future Pain and Suffering

The injuries that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] sustained on [INCIDENT_DATE], caused [him/her/them] a great deal of physical and emotional pain and suffering. As a result of your insured's negligence, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] suffered serious injuries that affected [his/her/their] entire life. [PERSONALIZED_PAIN_AND_SUFFERING_NARRATIVE]

[Continue with specific examples of how injuries affected daily life, relationships, activities, sleep, mental health, etc.]

To this day, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] continues to experience residual symptoms from [his/her/their] injuries. As [his/her/their] injuries interfered with [his/her/their] physical abilities, [he/she/they] [was/were] unjustly imposed with a direct impediment that significantly impacted [his/her/their] ability to go about life as [he/she/they] once lived and adversely affected [him/her/them] physically, emotionally, and mentally. Everything that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has gone through, and continues to go through, is the result of your insured's clear negligence. In short, [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] has been forced to endure significant pain and suffering because of this senseless incident, and there is no question that a jury would be very sympathetic to [his/her/their] situation.

The goal of compensatory damages is to make the injured party whole to the extent it is possible to measure the injury in terms of money. *Ky. Cent. Ins. Co. v. Schneider*, 15 S.W.3d 373, 374 (Ky. 2000). Damages should include fair compensation for any physical or mental suffering caused by the injury. *Ky. Cent. Ins. Co. v. Schneider*, 15 S.W.3d 373, 374 (Ky. 1995). There is no set rule for computing damages for pain and suffering. The general rule is that the damages must be reasonable, free from sentiment and free from punishment so as not to amount to punitive damages. *Noel v. Creary*, 385 S.W.2d 951, 953 (Ky. 1965). The probability of future pain and suffering may be considered when calculating damages if the evidence shows that future pain and suffering may stem from the injury. *Nussbaum v. Caskey*, 235 Ky. 640, 32 S.W.2d 18, 19 (Ky. App. 1930).

Liability is clear. Should this case go to a jury, the sole question to answer would be how much money [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] is entitled to receive under Kentucky law.

#### Verdict Analysis

Based on case results with similar facts, we assert that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME] is entitled to, at least, past and future pain and suffering damages in the amount of **$[PAIN_SUFFERING_AMOUNT]**. As justification for this claim, we direct your attention to the following:

##### [COMPARABLE_VERDICT_TITLE]

| **Jurisdiction** | [JURISDICTION] |
| **Award** | $[AWARD_AMOUNT] |

| **Injuries** | [INJURIES_IN_COMPARABLE_CASE] |
| **Relevance** | [EXPLANATION_OF_WHY_THIS_CASE_IS_RELEVANT_AND_COMPARABLE] |

#### Per Diem Analysis

Our conservative per diem analysis shows that [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME]'s claim for past, present, and future pain and suffering is valued at **$[PER_DIEM_TOTAL]**. A jury will consider not only [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME]'s initial pain and suffering to date but also [his/her/their] subsequent pain and suffering. Below are some very conservative figures we would present to a jury to consider, in addition to [his/her/their] other damages:

- $[INITIAL_HOURLY_RATE]/hr. for initial pain and suffering from [START_DATE_INITIAL] to [END_DATE_INITIAL]; and
- $[SUBSEQUENT_HOURLY_RATE]/hr. for subsequent pain and suffering from [START_DATE_SUBSEQUENT] to [END_DATE_SUBSEQUENT].

##### Pain & Suffering

**Initial Pain & Suffering**

| | |
|---|---|
| Initial Period (in Days) | [DAYS_INITIAL] |
| Waking Hours/Day | [WAKING_HOURS] |
| Reasonable Compensation/Hour | $[INITIAL_HOURLY_RATE] |
| **Total Initial Pain & Suffering** | **$[INITIAL_TOTAL]** |

**Subsequent Pain & Suffering**

| | |
|---|---|
| Subsequent Years with Pain | [YEARS_SUBSEQUENT] |
| Days/Year | 365 |
| Waking Hours/Day | [WAKING_HOURS] |
| Reasonable Compensation/Hour | $[SUBSEQUENT_HOURLY_RATE] |
| **Total Subsequent Pain & Suffering** | **$[SUBSEQUENT_TOTAL]** |

**Total Pain and Suffering: $[PER_DIEM_TOTAL]**

In light of the per diem analysis above, we assert that **$[PAIN_SUFFERING_AMOUNT]** is fair and equitable compensation for [CLIENT_SHORT_NAME]'s initial and subsequent pain and suffering.
