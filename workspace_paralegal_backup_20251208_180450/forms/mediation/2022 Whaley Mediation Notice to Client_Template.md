RE: [PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME] -- Knox County Circuit Court -- Division II

Dear Amy:

We are writing to let you know that we have arranged a non-binding mediation in an effort to resolve your claim. It is likely that we have explained this already, but mediation is a process by which the parties attempt to resolve a claim with the assistance of an impartial, third person. The third party, usually a retired judge or an attorney trained in mediation, points out the strengths and weaknesses of the claims made by both the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Often, this mediation will result in a settlement of the Plaintiff\'s claim. Thus, it is possible that we will reach a settlement of your claim at the mediation.

No judgment is entered for either party. A successful mediation depends on the willingness of both the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. Neither party will walk away totally happy, but, by reaching a settlement at the mediation, both parties will have avoided the risks associated with a trial. The parties split the cost of the hearing. Typically, the cost of settling a claim through mediation is about 10% of the cost of a trial.

***[Your mediation is scheduled to take place on [DATE] at 1:30p via a Zoom Meeting.]{.underline}*** The Zoom link and login information will be provided by the mediation services closer to the actual mediation date.

In the near future, we will be preparing a mediation statement to be forwarded to the mediator prior to the mediation. we may be contacting you if we need your assistance preparing this document. Please plan to attend the mediation on the date and time referenced above, and [contact our office thirty (30) minutes before the mediation is scheduled to begin to discuss any questions you may have]{.underline}.

Sincerely,
