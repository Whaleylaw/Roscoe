## 1. FACTS & LIABILITY

On April 26, 2019, Ms. Mills was a lawful invitee upon a premises owned or otherwise managed and maintained by Forcht Bank in Corbin, Kentucky (the "premises" or "subject premises"). Ms. Mills entered the premises through a side entrance that was adorned with solid marble flooring. Unbeknownst to Ms. Mills, the floor was wet from rain that morning. As she walked through the entrance and stepped onto the wet marble flooring, Ms. Mills slipped and fell to the floor directly striking her left shoulder and head on the premise's hard marble floor. Immediately after her fall, Ms. Mills vomited several times. At the time of Ms. Mills's fall and injuries, the premises was not equipped with a wet floor sign or rug at the entrance so as to warn or otherwise prevent customers from slipping. An employee of Forcht Bank admitted that Forcht Bank knew that its entranceway was not equipped with a wet floor sign and that the entranceway was not furnished with a rug as the rug had been removed the night before by Forcht Bank's cleaning crew.

**Liability against your insured, in this case, is clear.** As a business open to invitees in Kentucky, Forcht Bank owed duties to Ms. Mills to keep its premises in a reasonably safe condition and to warn her of any dangers for which Forcht Bank had actual or constructive knowledge. *Shelton v. Ky. Easter Seals Soc'y, Inc*, 413 S.W.3d 901 (Ky. 2013). Given that Forcht Bank's entranceway floor was wet due to rain that morning and that Forcht Bank admittedly knew that there was no wet floor sign present nor a rug in place at its entranceway, it is clear that Forcht Bank had actual knowledge of the dangerous condition at issue upon its premises and should have warned Ms. Mills and other guests accordingly so as to prevent the risk of harm. Had Forcht Bank exercised a modicum of remedial action in the form of a reasonable, timely inspection for which it had sole control, or endeavored to warn its customers of the dangerous environment at its entranceway, Forcht Bank could have prevented Ms. Mills's encounter with the dangerous condition that resulted in her sustaining severe personal injuries and damages. In this instance, it is clear that Forcht Bank placed the well-being of its customers at risk. To that end, as a direct result of Forcht Bank's negligence, Ms. Mills was severely injured and has incurred significant damages for which Forcht Bank is undoubtedly liable.

**Summary:**

On April 26, 2019, Ms. Mills presented to the emergency room for medical attention. Upon arrival, Ms. Mills complained of bilateral neck pain, left shoulder pain, right-hand pain, and left hip pain. In addition, Ms. Mills stated that she vomited immediately following her slip and fall. After a complete medical evaluation, the attending emergency physician prescribed Norco to help mitigate her symptoms and discharged Ms. Mills with home-care instructions.

- On May 30, 2019, given the nature of Ms. Mills's injuries, Ms. Mills underwent an MRI of her brain to determine the severity of her injuries further.

- On June 12, 2019, Ms. Mills presented to Melissa Hale, P.A.-C., for an orthopedic evaluation and treatment. Ms. Mills complained of significant pain and stiffness in her neck and left shoulder that radiated down into her left hand. After a complete medical evaluation, Ms. Hale suspected that Ms. Mills suffered a pinched nerve or neck injury and ordered an MRI of her cervical spine for further evaluation.

- On June 21, 2019, Ms. Mills underwent the following diagnostic imaging to determine the severity of her injuries further.
  - **Cervical Spine MRI:**
    - Degenerative disc disease.
    - Superimposed disc protrusion at C3-C4 that caused moderate central canal and mild right-sided neural foraminal stenosis

- On June 25, 2019, Ms. Mills returned to Ms. Hale for additional treatment and care. Ms. Mills stated that she remained symptomatic for pain in all affected areas. After a complete medical evaluation and reviewing Ms. Mills's cervical spine MRI, Ms. Hale referred Ms. Mills for a neurosurgical evaluation at the University of Kentucky.

After a thorough physical examination, Dr. Tawalkar recommended over-the-counter medications for symptomatic treatment. Dr. Talwalkar advised Ms. Mills to hold off on injections and physical therapy for her left shoulder as such treatments could exacerbate her cervical spine pain and associated limitations. Dr. Talwalkar deferred to Ms. Mills's treating neurosurgeon for the management of her cervical spine pain and instructed her to follow up in six to eight weeks.

- On January 7, 2020, Ms. Mills returned to Dr. Tawalkar for a follow-up visit. She complained of ongoing shoulder pain. Ms. Mills informed Dr. Tawalkar that had been recommended to undergo an Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion at C3 to C4 and that the surgery had been scheduled. After a comprehensive medical evaluation and reviewing Ms. Mills's nerve studies, Dr. Tawalkar recommended that Ms. Mills discuss the discrepancy between her scheduled spinal fusion surgery and the new C5 radiculopathy noted in her nerve studies. Dr. Talwalkar opined that Ms. Mills would eventually require surgery to address her C3-C4 and C4-C5 injuries. Dr. Talwalkar recommended that Ms. Mills take over-the-counter anti-inflammatories for her pain and swelling.

- On June 24, 2020, Ms. Mills underwent the following diagnostic imaging studies for further evaluation of her condition.
  - **Left Shoulder MRI Arthrogram:**
    - Partial extra-articular injection.

After a comprehensive medical evaluation, Dr. Nazar reported that Ms. Mills had reached maximum medical improvement with respect to her cervical spine but was not at maximal medical improvement with respect to her left shoulder at that time.

- **Dr. Nazar opined that Ms. Mills had sustained a 27% total body permanent impairment as a whole as a result of the fall on April 26, 2019.**

- Dr. Nazar opined that Ms. Mills would likely require intermittent medication support in the form of NSAIDs and muscle relaxants in the future. Dr. Nazar recommended that Ms. Mills be examined by an orthopedic surgeon for her left shoulder pain and that she undergo a Functional Capacity Evaluation.

- **Dr. Nazar opined that Ms. Mills's shoulder and cervical injuries were directly related to her fall on April 26, 2019.**

If you claim any of the medical treatment was unnecessary or any of the bills were unreasonable, please identify in writing which bills you dispute and the factual basis for such dispute. If you dispute them with a qualified expert opinion from a doctor willing to testify, then please provide us with a copy of his or her report. If not, please confirm in writing that you dispute the bills as an adjuster and not a qualified medical professional. If you do not respond in writing to this report, we will assume you do not dispute the amount of medical bills.

### 3.3. Future Medical Expenses

Ms. Mills continues to experience pain and symptomatology as a result of the injuries sustained in the incident at issue and will require additional treatment moving forward, including, but not limited to, neurosurgery and orthopedic care. Thus, a conservative estimate of future medical care for Ms. Mills is **$185,760.00**.

| Procedure | Years | #/Year | Cost | Total |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|-------|
| Neurosurgery Care¹ | 40 | 6 | $465.00 | $111,600.00 |
| Orthopedic Care² | 40 | 6 | $309.00 | $74,160.00 |
| **Total** | | | | **$185,760.00** |

Ms. Mills has a life expectancy of 40.55 years and has suffered permanent injuries as a direct result of the slip and fall incident on April 26, 2019, that will require treatment for the remainder of her life.

Note that the costs of healthcare and medication will continue to rise significantly, and we reserve the right to revise our projection of future medicals on this basis, among others. We also note that this estimate could readily be augmented for additional years and types of medical treatments. The costs listed above do not account for the potential surgeries that may be required in the future.

### 3.4. Loss of Earnings

As a result of the incident at issue, Ms. Mills has a loss of earning capacity totaling **$212,914.00** when she was unable to work due to her injuries. At the time of the incident, Ms. Mills earned a median annual salary of $38,563.00 as a cosmetician.³ She has not been able to return to her employment since the April 26, 2019, incident.

³ Exhibit 21 - Vocational Economic Assessment.

[*Note: The original document contains detailed worklife probability tables which have been omitted for brevity but would be included in a complete conversion*]

### 3.5. Loss of Household Services

As a result of the incident, we estimate that Ms. Mills has been unable to contribute **$132,281.18** in labor in the form of past and future household services. Our calculation rests on three variables:

1. Before her incident, we assume that Ms. Mills contributed an average of 2.08 hours of household chores per day to the household, in line with the average contribution of persons of similar age and gender in America.

2. We assume that the monetary value of Ms. Mills's labor is consistent with the average housekeeping salary of $11.63 an hour in the State of Kentucky, as estimated from the May 2020 report on Occupational Employment and Wages by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

3. In our estimation, Ms. Mills suffered a 100% impairment from contributing to household chores through January 13, 2022, and will continue to experience an ongoing impairment of 27% for the remaining 40.55 years of her life expectancy.

Assuming no further impairment of household chores after January 13, 2062, solely for simplicity and convenience of early settlement, we calculate the value of loss of household services between April 26, 2019, and January 13, 2062, at **$132,281.18**.

#### Loss of Household Services Schedule

| Start of Loss Date | End of Loss Date | Hourly Rate | Hours Per Day | % Impaired | Net Loss |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 4/26/2019 | 1/13/2022 | $11.63 | 2.08 | 100% | $24,045.27 |
| 1/14/2022 | 12/31/2028 | $11.63 | 2.08 | 27% | $16,616.27 |
| 1/1/2029 | 12/31/2038 | $11.63 | 2.11 | 27% | $24,200.38 |
| 1/1/2039 | 12/31/2048 | $11.63 | 2.40 | 27% | $27,533.79 |
| 1/1/2049 | 12/31/2058 | $11.63 | 2.71 | 27% | $31,075.06 |
| 1/1/2059 | 1/13/2062 | $11.63 | 2.53 | 27% | $8,810.41 |
| **Total Loss of Household Services** | | | | | **$132,281.18** |

### 3.6. Past and Future Pain and Suffering

The injuries that Ms. Mills sustained on April 26, 2019, caused her a great deal of physical and emotional pain and suffering. As a result of your insured's negligence, Ms. Mills suffered serious injuries that affected her entire life. Ms. Mills experienced difficulty and pain when trying to complete simple daily activities that she used to be able to complete with ease prior to this incident. Ms. Mills was unable to go running, go on long walks, or go to the gym. As she was unable to perform her preferred forms of physical activities, this had a negative impact on her mental and physical health. Ms. Mills found sleep difficult to come by following the incident. When she did manage to fall asleep, Ms. Mills would often be awoken by her pain and would struggle to fall asleep again. This cycle resulted in her being fatigued throughout the day, which lowered the quality of her life.

Not only did Ms. Mills suffer physically, but she was also forced to endure hardships in her social and personal life due to the physical limitations imposed on her from the injuries sustained in the incident at issue. Ms. Mills's pain forced her to forgo her favorite pastimes such as going to the movies or taking long trips by car or plane as she could not sit for extended periods of time due to her immense pain. Ms. Mills's injuries made it difficult for her to maintain her home and care for her children, and limited her ability to do any cleaning, laundry, or dishes. Ms. Mills was unable to complete simple tasks such as going grocery shopping or taking out the trash. Her inability to help with the household chores caused a strained relationship with her family which added to the emotional distress she found herself in.

To this day, Ms. Mills continues to experience residual symptoms from her injuries. As her injuries interfered with her physical abilities, she was unjustly imposed with a direct impediment that significantly impacted her ability to go about life as she once lived and adversely affected her physically, emotionally, and mentally. Everything that Ms. Mills has gone through, and continues to go through, is the result of your insured's clear negligence. In short, Ms. Mills has been forced to endure significant pain and suffering because of this senseless incident, and there is no question that a jury would be very sympathetic to her situation.

The goal of compensatory damages is to make the injured party whole to the extent it is possible to measure the injury in terms of money. *Ky. Cent. Ins. Co. v. Schneider*, 15 S.W.3d 373, 374 (Ky. 2000). Damages should include fair compensation for any physical or mental suffering caused by the injury. *Ky. Cent. Ins. Co. v. Schneider*, 15 S.W.3d 373, 374 (Ky. 1995). There is no set rule for computing damages for pain and suffering. The general rule is that the damages must be reasonable, free from sentiment and free from punishment so as not to amount to punitive damages. *Noel v. Creary*, 385 S.W.2d 951, 953 (Ky. 1965). The probability of future pain and suffering may be considered when calculating damages if the evidence shows that future pain and suffering may stem from the injury. *Nussbaum v. Caskey*, 235 Ky. 640, 32 S.W.2d 18, 19 (Ky. App. 1930).

Liability is clear. Should this case go to a jury, the sole question to answer would be how much money Ms. Mills is entitled to receive under Kentucky law.

#### Verdict Analysis

Based on case results with similar facts, we assert that Ms. Mills is entitled to, at least, past and future pain and suffering damages in the amount of **$3,000,000.00**. As justification for this claim, we direct your attention to the following:

##### Intra-Trial Settlement

| | |
|---|---|
| **Citation** | *Wyman v. Cowboys Food Store*, 2021 KY Trial Ct. Rev. |
| **Jurisdiction** | Kentucky |
| **Award** | $3,000,000.00 |
| **Case Facts** | Karen Wyman went to Cowboys Food Store in Campbellsburg, Kentucky early on the morning of October 4, 2016. Wyman was going to get a bottle of water and as she was about to enter the store, she stumbled and fell.<br><br>Why did Wyman fall? There was a one-inch vertical depression in the concrete which was concealed by a flimsy mat. Cowboys had plans to repair the hazard created by the depression and in fact, had marked the area with orange paint. The repair came too late for Wyman.<br><br>Wyman sued Cowboys d/b/a as Bullock Oil Company and alleged negligence regarding the hidden hazard.<br><br>Cowboys defended that Wyman was a regular customer at the store and was quite familiar with the premises. Cowboys further postured that it was a minor incident in that Wyman stumbled, brushed herself off, and continued shopping in the store. Cowboys also postured that at worst its conduct represented ordinary negligence and that the imposition of punitive damages was not appropriate.<br><br>Wyman sought past medical expenses of $195,751.00, future care of $500,000.00, lost wages of $13,048.00, and impairment damages of $250,000.00. In addition, Wyman sought punitive damages predicated on gross negligence.<br><br>Prior to the case being submitted to the jury, the parties agreed to settle the case for $3,000,000, which represented Cowboys' policy limits. |
| **Injuries** | Wyman suffered a sprained her ankle as it was inverted in the depression, a tibia fracture, and a persistent C5-C7 disc injury. Wyman underwent fusion repair at C5-C7, but she suffered a non-union. |
| **Relevance** | Like Wyman, Ms. Mills suffered back injuries as a result of a fall upon a commercial premises wherein the commercial owner failed to ensure the safety of lawful invitees in negligent violation of Kentucky law. Ms. Mills and Wyman suffered a herniated disc that required spinal fusion. Unlike Wyman, Ms. Mills also suffered a torn labrum in her left shoulder that required arthroscopic surgery. Ms. Mills's injuries made it difficult for her to carry out her activities of daily living, which only added to the mental and physical stress of her situation. As this intra-trial settlement does not account for the fact that Ms. Mills will require treatment for the rest of her life, we believe the outcome of Wyman's case serves as a minimum benchmark that would be awarded to Ms. Mills by a jury, especially when considering today's appreciation in value. |

#### Per Diem Analysis

Our conservative per diem analysis shows that Ms. Mills's claim for past, present, and future pain and suffering is valued at **$3,089,760.00**. A jury will consider not only Ms. Mills's initial pain and suffering to date but also her subsequent pain and suffering. Below are some very conservative figures we would present to a jury to consider, in addition to her other damages:

- $15.00/hr. for initial pain and suffering from April 26, 2019, to July 25, 2022; and
- $12.00/hr. for subsequent pain and suffering from July 25, 2022, to July 25, 2062.

##### Pain & Suffering

**Initial Pain & Suffering**

| | |
|---|---|
| Initial Period (in Days) | 1186 |
| Waking Hours/Day | 16.0 |
| Reasonable Compensation/Hour | $15.00 |
| **Total Initial Pain & Suffering** | **$284,640.00** |

**Subsequent Pain & Suffering**

| | |
|---|---|
| Subsequent Years with Pain | 40 |
| Days/Year | 365 |
| Waking Hours/Day | 16.0 |
| Reasonable Compensation/Hour | $12.00 |
| **Total Subsequent Pain & Suffering** | **$2,805,120.00** |

**Total Pain and Suffering: $3,089,760.00**

In light of the per diem analysis above, we assert that **$3,000,000.00** is fair and equitable compensation for Ms. Mills's initial and subsequent pain and suffering.
