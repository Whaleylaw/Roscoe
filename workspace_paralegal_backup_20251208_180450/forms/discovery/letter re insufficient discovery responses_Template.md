**Re: Yussuf H. Mukoma, et al., v Grange Mutual Insurance Company**

**Jefferson Circuit Court Division Ten (10)**

Dear [CLIENT_NAME],

This letter will acknowledge receipt of your client's late Answers to Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents which were recently received in our office. After review of the Defendant's Answers to discovery, there are certain discovery responses which the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. I have set forth a summary of the discovery disputes which we are requesting the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

[INTERROGATORY NO. 1]{.underline}

The Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and every employee who made *any decision* regarding whether any Basic Reparations Benefits would be denied to any of the Plaintiffs. (*Emphasis added*.) This request further set forth that "employee of the Defendant" included, but was not limited to, any claims adjuster, agent, officer, director, physician, doctor, nurse, case manager, or any other person who received compensation of any type from Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. (See Interrogatory No. 1.) However, Defendant failed to list any name of any employee(s) involved in the decision making progress relative to Plaintiffs' payments of Basic Reparation Benefits. Adversely, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Considering zero Basic Reparation Benefits have been paid relative to these Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], Defendant's Answer to Interrogatory No. 1 is incomplete and Defendant needs to produce the names of their employee(s) whom made the determinations not to pay the Basic Reparation Benefits for Plaintiffs.

[INTERROGATORY NO. 2]{.underline}

The Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. This request asked for additional specific information to be provided relative to any medical professional named. (See Interrogatory Number 2.) Defendant's Answer, "Not applicable," is vague and ambiguous and not an answer. If no medical professional(s) were consulted, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. If medical professional(s) were consulted, Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and therefore request Defendant supplement their Answer to Interrogatory Number 2.

[INTERROGATORY NO. 3]{.underline}

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], address, and phone number of each person who Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. (See Interrogatory Number 3.) Defendant's Answer objected from multiple angles, several of which Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME]. However, subject to their many objections, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], "other than the people listed on the police report and Margaret Burton, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]."

Ms. Burton is included on the police report, however, her phone number and confirmation of her current address were not provided by Defendant. Furthermore, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and failed to provide any information relative to Ms. Burton's expected testimony. Additionally, within the documents Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], the investigation notes clearly state that Mike Schrecker communicated and obtained a recorded statement of a Witness, Melissa Swan, whom was not named by Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], as set forth below.

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

[INTERROGATORY NO. 4 AND]{.underline}

[REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 3]{.underline}

This request sought the name and address of each person interviewed regarding this matter, to include the party conducting the interview, the location of the interview, whether said interview was recorded, and the substance of the information obtained in the interview. (See Interrogatory Number 4 and Request for Production Number 3.) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], instead Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Since the claim phase of the subject collision, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], investigators, and now continued by their counsel, have repeatedly asseverated to Plaintiffs' counsel that they have a recorded statement of a witness. Defendant's position relative to the facts and circumstances of this matter, and the denial or failure of Plaintiffs' Basic Reparation Benefits, have been postulated upon this recorded statement they claim they have in their possession, yet have never produced to Plaintiffs. Their failure to produce this claimed recorded statement, or any information regarding said statement, along with any other potential statements which Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], is evasive and incomplete. Plaintiffs request the Defendant supplement their Answer to Interrogatory Number 4 and Request for Production Number 3 and provide any and all recorded statements relative to the subject collision immediately upon receipt of this correspondence.

[INTERROGATORY NO. 6 AND]{.underline}

[REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 8]{.underline}

Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and all notices sent pursuant to KRS 304.39-210(5) and to produce a copy of each. (See Interrogatory Number 6 and Request for Production Number 8.) Defendant's Answers to these requests state their failure to meet their statutory duties. Furthermore, Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], in fact, refused, failed and continue to deny payment for Plaintiffs' medical treatment relative to the subject collision. Plaintiffs are entitled to written notice setting forth the reason(s) for denial or rejection of Basic Reparation Benefits and herein request these answers be supplemented as prescribed by the laws of this Commonwealth.

[INTERROGATORY NO. 7]{.underline}

[AND INTERROGATORY NO. 8]{.underline}

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and authority that supports their failure to pay the medical bills of Plaintiffs within 30 or 45 days of receipt. (See Interrogatory Numbers 7 & 8.) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], which Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], and then stated they had not received reasonable proof of the fact and amount of loss. The Supreme Court of Kentucky has long held that medical records and bills are "sufficient to establish that the medical bills are reasonable and related to the accident." *[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME],* 192 S.W.3d. 311, 318 (Ky. 2006). Kentucky law prescribes, "There shall be a presumption that any medical bill submitted is reasonable." KRS 304.39-020(5)(a). Plaintiffs' medical records and billing were submitted to Defendant on the following dates:

Yussuf Mukoma [DATE]

Mohamed Hassan [DATE]

Amina Hassa [DATE]

Mohamed Omar [DATE]

> Said Abdullahi [DATE]

Muslimo Hassan [DATE]

Furthermore, within Defendant's produced documents, their investigation notes show that they were able to make contact with each Plaintiff on [DATE]. On the same date Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], insurer of the at-fault driver, Joel Mackey, accepted liability on behalf of their insured's negligence. Yet Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. Plaintiffs request Defendant supplement their Answer to Interrogatories Numbers 7 and 8 and provide the requested information upon receipt of this correspondence.

[REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 4]{.underline}

Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. (See Request for Production Number 4.) Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] is not relevant when in fact, their refusal to pay Basic Reparation Benefits is the leading factor forcing the filing of this suit and is therefore highly relevant. Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

[REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION NO. 5]{.underline}

Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] and all training manuals or similar items for GRANGE'S adjusters, claims managers or employees relating to the adjustment of Basic Reparation Benefits claims. (See Request for Production Number 5.) Defendant's response stated, "See Answer to Request for Production No. 5". This is Request for Production Number 5, and Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] is not an answer. Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME].

> Very truly yours,

Aaron M. Murphy
