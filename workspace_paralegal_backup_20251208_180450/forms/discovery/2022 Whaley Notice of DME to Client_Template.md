Dear Katie:

You have been scheduled for a second independent medical exam (IME) by the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME]. An IME is a review of your medical history and a physical examination for the evaluation of your current condition and if/how it is related to your accident.

Your medical records have already been forwarded to the medical provider, however, if you have any imaging films in your possession, please bring them to your appointment.

In a lawsuit, as in all other matters, honesty is the best policy. Tell the truth, even with respect to details that may be unfavorable. Do not exaggerate. Telling the truth means that you testify accurately about what you know. Any other witness is compelled to do the same. Your appearance and behavior at the examination are very important, as they will make a strong impression on the opposing parties. You should wear what you would normally wear on a more important occasion, such as going to church, to a wedding, or to an important business meeting. Make sure what you wear is comfortable.

You are required to attend this examination and cooperate to the extent your physical condition allows, however, be mindful that your examiner is being paid by your employer, their insurance and/or their legal counsel and does not have your best interest at heart. It is imperative that you do not lose your temper or get excited during the examination.

Always be polite to the examiner and their staff. Address the examiner properly (\"Mr./Ms.\" or \"sir/ma\'am\"). When you are asked a question, listen carefully to the question and answer it as completely and truthfully as you can. Do not try to anticipate what the examiner is going to ask. This can make you seem calculating and devious. If you do not know the answer to a question, just say that you do not know the answer. Do not guess on your answers. If you realize you gave an incorrect answer, correct it immediately. You may not be positive about how to answer a question. For these answers, qualify your response with: \"To the best of my knowledge\... or \"I believe\...\". Do not lock yourself into an answer if you are not certain about your response. **[Be]{.underline} [careful]{.underline}** on questions involving distances and time. If you make an estimate, make sure everyone understands that you are estimating.

It is normal for people to be nervous before a medical examination. If you need to stop and ask a question, you have the right to do that. Additionally, if you need to use the restroom, or if you need something to drink, the examination can be stopped for those reasons as well.

As always, if you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further details. We look forward to moving your claim along to a successful resolution & appreciate your attention, time & effort in assisting with your claim.

Sincerely,

> [[ATTORNEY_NAME], Esq.]{.underline}
