Re: **[PLAINTIFF_NAME] v. [DEFENDANT_NAME]**

Date: [DATE]

Due: [DATE]

Dear Mr. Kannady:

On [DATE], our office propounded Discovery Requests up to and including Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. Unfortunately, we have not received any acknowledgement or response to our request. Discovery Responses are due within thirty (30) days from the date of preponderance and as of today fifty-four (54) days have passed.

Please provide our office with your client's responses and document production as soon as possible to avoid a Motion to Compel. If your office and/or your client needs additional time to compile the requested information, please contact our office to discuss the potential for an Agreed Order to Extend Discovery Deadline.

Sincerely,

> [[ATTORNEY_NAME], Esq.]{.underline}
