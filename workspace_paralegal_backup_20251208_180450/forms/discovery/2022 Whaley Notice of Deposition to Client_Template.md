Dear [CLIENT_NAME],

You have been scheduled for a deposition. A deposition is a sworn statement that you will give before a court reporter. The attorney for the opposing side will ask you questions about your case. We will be present with you at this deposition. A deposition is nothing to fear. It is a normal part of a civil case and it allows the opposing parties an opportunity to meet you and evaluate your testimony. They will also inquire about your background, the facts of the case, and the legal contentions of your case.

Before you go to your deposition, I will need to meet with you to discuss your case and prepare you for your deposition testimony. **[Please arrive thirty (30) minutes before the deposition is scheduled to begin]{.underline}** so that we may discuss your testimony.

In a lawsuit, as in all other matters, honesty is the best policy. You are under oath and must tell the truth, even with respect to details that may be unfavorable. Do not exaggerate. Telling the truth means that you testify accurately about what you know. Any other witness is compelled to do the same. One of the most important reasons for the other side to take your deposition is to allow them to meet you. Your appearance and behavior at the deposition are very important, as they will make a strong impression on the opposing parties. You should wear what you would normally wear on a more important occasion, such as going to church, to a wedding, or to an important business meeting. Make sure what you wear is comfortable.

It is imperative that you do not lose your temper or get excited during the deposition. If you get angry, you will make a bad impression on the other side. Always be polite to the opposing attorney. Address the attorney properly (\"Mr./Ms.\" or \"sir/ma\'am\"). When you are asked a question, listen carefully to the question and answer it as completely and truthfully as you can. Do not try to anticipate what the other attorney is going to ask. This can make you seem calculating and devious. When you answer a question from an attorney in the deposition, look the attorney directly in the eye. Eye contact is a very important indication of sincerity and truthfulness. If you do not know the answer to a question, just say that you do not know the answer. Do not guess on your answers. If you realize you gave an incorrect answer, correct it immediately. You may not be positive about how to answer a question. For these answers, qualify your response with: \"To the best of my knowledge\... or \"I believe\...\". Do not lock yourself into an answer if you are not certain about your response. **[Be]{.underline} [careful]{.underline}** on questions involving distances and time. If you make an estimate, make sure everyone understands that you are estimating.

If the attorney for the other side asks an improper question, we will object to the question before you answer it. It is normal procedure to do so. You should follow your instructions to the letter. Answer only the questions that we advise you to answer. Do not answer any questions that we advise you not to answer. You may be asked questions that you do not care to answer. If we do not object to the question, you must still give a response. Give an audible answer so that the court reporter can record it. Do not nod your head \"yes\" or otherwise answer with a nonverbal gesture. The court reporter can only record verbal responses. Speak loudly so everyone can hear you. Do not chew gum. Keep your hands away from your mouth. (You cannot speak distinctly while chewing gum or with your hand over your mouth.) Do not hang your head or look away when answering a question.

It is normal for people to be nervous before a deposition. If you need to stop a deposition to ask a question, you have the right to do that. Additionally, if you need to use the restroom, or if you need something to drink, the deposition can be stopped for those reasons as well. In a discovery deposition, it is very possible that we will not ask you any questions. However, if we feel that it is appropriate, we might ask you questions after the opposing attorney has finished questioning you.

Sincerely,
