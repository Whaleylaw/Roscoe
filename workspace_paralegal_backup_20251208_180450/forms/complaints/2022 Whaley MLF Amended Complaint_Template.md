**[FACTUAL AND JURISDICTIONAL AVERMENTS TO ALL COUNTS]{.underline}**

Comes the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], by counsel, and moves the Court pursuant to CR 15.01 for leave to file her Amended Complaint. The Amended Complaint[^1] adds additional detail and sets forth common-law negligent entrustment claim against the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], who owned the vehicle that was negligently driven by the unknown driver in this case. The wreck occurred on [DATE] and suit was filed only months later, on [DATE]. Accordingly, there is no prejudice to any party as no discovery has been conducted and Plaintiff is well within the two-year limitations period applicable to automobile accident cases. Negligent entrustment has been recognized in Kentucky since at least 1931. *See Brady v. B&B Ice Co., 242 Ky. 138, 45 S.W.2d 1051 (Ky. 1931).* The common-law theory of negligent entrustment is actionable against a vehicle owner who entrusts his/her vehicle to another whom he/she knows to be inexperienced, careless, or reckless, and the vehicle owner is liable for the natural and probable consequences of the entrustment. *McGrew v. Stone, 998 S.W.2d 5 (Ky. 1999).*

Comes the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], by counsel, and for her Amended Complaint, hereby states as follows:

1.  The Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], reiterates, and incorporates by reference, as though fully set out herein, each and every allegation of her original Complaint including numerical paragraphs 1 -- 18 of the Original Complaint.

2.  In addition to the allegations in the Original Complaint, Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME] was intended to deceive Plaintiff and conceal the identity of the negligent driver:

> 'Unit 1 Operator \[unknown negligent driver\] was not on scene when the police arrived. Officers located a photo of the suspected male on social media of a male described as the subject that fled. The subject was identified ... as an individual known to Unit 1 vehicle owner \[Virginia Sewell\]. Officers found out that \[Sewell\] then made a stolen vehicle report for her vehicle while officers were on scene working the accident. Officers called \[Sewell\] and she stated she spoke to her boyfriend prior to filing the report for the stolen vehicle.
>
> There was no damage to the vehicle's ignition and it being a push start would not allow the vehicle to start without a key. Officers spoke with \[Sewell\] and she stated she only had one set of keys. Then she changed her statement when confronted about the ignition. She then stated she had a spare but has not been able to locate that key for a while.'

3.  In addition to the claims in the Original Complaint, at all relevant times, Virginia Sewell was the owner of the vehicle involved in the [DATE] wreck that negligently collided with the vehicle occupied by Plaintiff.

4.  Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME], negligently and carelessly entrusted said vehicle to the unknown driver Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME].

5.  Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] was a substantial factor in causing Plaintiff's injuries as alleged in the Original Complaint.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff demands as follows:

1.  Judgement against the Defendant, [DEFENDANT_NAME] and individually, in an amount which will fairly and reasonably compensate the Plaintiff for her damages alleged herein;

2.  Trial by Jury;

3.  Plaintiff's costs herein expended; and

4.  Any and all other relief which the Plaintiff, [PLAINTIFF_NAME], including the right to further amend this Complaint, if necessary.
