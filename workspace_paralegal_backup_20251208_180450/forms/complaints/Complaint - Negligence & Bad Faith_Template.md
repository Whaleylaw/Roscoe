That Safeco has effectively denied such claim by refusing to make a good faith attempt at compromising Plaintiff's claim against its insured and such denial lacks a reasonable basis in law or fact and was made with Safeco's knowledge that no reasonable basis exists for such denial or was made with a reckless disregard for whether such a claim exists and otherwise, Safeco's acts and omissions amount to a bad faith attempt at settling a valid claim on behalf of its insured.
