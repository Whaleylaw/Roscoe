# Defense Medical Expert (IME) Cross-Examination Module

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**IME Cross-Examination Preparation Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion produces a comprehensive, case-specific cross-examination outline that:
- Exposes the defense medical expert's financial bias and lack of true independence
- Identifies methodology weaknesses and procedural flaws in the examination
- Prepares tactical questioning sequences to obtain favorable admissions
- Flags strategic adjustments needed based on case-specific red flags
- Provides the supervising attorney with ready-to-deploy courtroom scripts

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- A defense medical expert (IME) report has been received in the case
- Preparing for deposition of a defense-retained medical expert
- Preparing for trial cross-examination of an IME witness
- Reviewing an expert's qualifications prior to a Daubert/frye challenge
- Analyzing expert testimony patterns across multiple cases

---

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Step 1: Document Intake and Organization**
1.1. Collect all available inputs listed above
1.2. Flag any missing critical documents (especially CV, fee schedule, prior testimony)
1.3. Create a document reference index with source locations
1.4. Note any discovery requests that should be made for missing materials

#### **Step 2: Expert Background Investigation**
2.1. Analyze the expert's CV for:
   - Board certifications (correct specialty for case issues?)
   - Clinical practice vs. forensic work ratio
   - Academic appointments and publications
   - Years since active patient care
   
2.2. Research public records for:
   - Professional license status and any disciplinary actions
   - Criminal or civil court involvement
   - Pattern of testimony (plaintiff vs. defense retention ratio)
   - Prior sanctions or judicial criticism

2.3. Document findings with source citations

#### **Step 3: Financial Bias Analysis**
3.1. Calculate financial metrics:
   - Percentage of income derived from litigation work
   - Annual volume of IME examinations
   - Ratio of defense vs. plaintiff engagements
   - Fee comparison to standard clinical rates

3.2. Identify billing patterns for this case:
   - Total fees charged to date
   - Time billed for examination vs. records review
   - Preparation time with defense counsel

3.3. Flag any unusual compensation arrangements

#### **Step 4: Methodology Assessment**
4.1. Analyze the IME examination:
   - Duration of physical examination
   - Diagnostic tests performed vs. available tests not performed
   - Records reviewed vs. records available but not reviewed
   - Whether examination was recorded (notes, audio, video)

4.2. Compare to plaintiff's treating physician methodology:
   - Time spent with patient over treatment course
   - Diagnostic procedures performed
   - Follow-up care provided

4.3. Compare to plaintiff's expert methodology (if applicable):
   - Examination duration and scope
   - Testing performed
   - Records reviewed

4.4. Identify methodology gaps that undermine reliability

#### **Step 5: Opinion Analysis and Weakness Identification**
5.1. Extract key opinions from IME report:
   - Causation opinions
   - Diagnosis opinions
   - Prognosis opinions
   - Treatment necessity opinions

5.2. Compare each opinion to:
   - Treating physician findings
   - Plaintiff's expert opinions
   - Medical records documentation
   - Common medical knowledge

5.3. Identify contradictions, unsupported conclusions, and logical gaps

#### **Step 6: Prior Testimony Mining**
6.1. Review available prior testimony for:
   - Contradictory positions on similar issues
   - Admissions favorable to plaintiffs generally
   - Statements about methodology standards
   - Concessions about examination limitations

6.2. Create impeachment index with:
   - Exact quotes with transcript citations
   - Issue/topic classification
   - Suggested deployment point in cross-examination

#### **Step 7: Red Flag Assessment**
7.1. Evaluate for strategic red flags:

| Red Flag | Present? | Strategic Adjustment Required |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Expert opinion aligns with treating physicians | Yes/No | Pivot to nuanced points (impairment degree, future care necessity) |
| Plaintiff's expert has symmetrical weaknesses | Yes/No | Abandon mirrored attack lines; focus on unique vulnerabilities |
| Expert has pre-existing treatment relationship | Yes/No | Reduce bias attacks; pivot to favorable fact elicitation |
| Expert has exceptional credentials | Yes/No | Minimize qualification attacks; emphasize bias/methodology |
| Limited financial data available | Yes/No | Focus on case-specific fees and examination methodology |

7.2. Document required pivots and adjusted strategies

#### **Step 8: Tactical Sequence Construction**
8.1. Select applicable questioning sequences from playbook:
   - **"Independence" Attack** (§3.1) — Default: Always use unless treatment relationship exists
   - **Financial Motive Exposure** (§3.2) — Use when financial data supports bias narrative
   - **Coaching by Counsel** (§3.3) — Use when preparation meetings documented
   - **Favorable Admissions** (§3.4) — Always conclude with cooperation/non-malingering concessions

8.2. Customize scripts with case-specific facts:
   - Insert party names
   - Insert specific dates and amounts
   - Insert case-specific findings from IME report

8.3. Sequence questions according to structural principles:
   1. Start with foundational facts (easy agreement)
   2. Attack credibility/bias early (frame subsequent testimony)
   3. Build momentum through methodology challenges
   4. Deploy impeachment evidence strategically (space throughout)
   5. End with strongest favorable admission

#### **Step 9: Cross-Examination Outline Assembly**
9.1. Organize final outline by attack themes:
   - Section 1: Independence Attack
   - Section 2: Financial Bias
   - Section 3: Methodology Deficiencies
   - Section 4: Credential/Experience Gaps
   - Section 5: Opinion Impeachment
   - Section 6: Favorable Admissions

9.2. Include for each section:
   - Objective statement
   - Scripted questions (with blanks filled)
   - Supporting exhibit references
   - Impeachment material citations
   - Anticipated objections and responses

9.3. Add strategic notes on:
   - Red flag adjustments
   - Alternative approaches if witness becomes hostile
   - Points to avoid based on symmetrical weakness analysis

#### **Step 10: Output Compilation and Delivery**
10.1. Generate final cross-examination preparation package:
   - Executive summary of key attack themes
   - Full cross-examination outline
   - Impeachment index with citations
   - Exhibit list with descriptions
   - Red flag summary with strategic adjustments

10.2. Flag open questions for attorney review
10.3. Note any additional discovery recommendations

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All questioning scripts use leading questions only (no who/what/where/why/how/explain)
- [ ] Each question contains only one fact
- [ ] All impeachment material is properly cited with transcript page/line
- [ ] Financial calculations are documented with source references
- [ ] Attack lines do not apply equally to plaintiff's own expert
- [ ] Red flag assessment completed for all five categories

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
- Expert has pre-existing treatment relationship with plaintiff → **Escalate**: Fundamental strategy shift required
- Expert's opinion aligns with treating physicians on core issues → **Escalate**: May indicate case weakness
- Discovery reveals expert has been sanctioned or disciplined → **Escalate**: Potential Daubert/Frye motion opportunity
- Financial records reveal unusually high litigation income percentage (>80%) → **Escalate**: Potential motion in limine opportunity
- Prior testimony contains directly contradictory statements on same issue → **Escalate**: Strong impeachment—verify admissibility

#### Ethical Guardrails
- Do not fabricate or assume facts not supported by documents
- Do not characterize expert opinions beyond what the report states
- Do not provide legal conclusions about admissibility or case outcome
- All work product is for attorney review and supervision
