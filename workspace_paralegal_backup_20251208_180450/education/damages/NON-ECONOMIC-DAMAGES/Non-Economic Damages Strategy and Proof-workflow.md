### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Plaintiff Presentation Assessment**

**Step 1.1 — Evaluate Plaintiff Likability Factors**

Review available information to assess the plaintiff's presentation profile:

| Factor | Assessment Question | Notes |
|--------|---------------------|-------|
| Authenticity | Does the plaintiff present as genuine and unrehearsed? | |
| Honesty | Does the plaintiff acknowledge what they CAN still do? | |
| Gratitude | Does the plaintiff express appreciation for support received? | |
| Resilience | Does the plaintiff focus on fighting to preserve what remains? | |
| Self-Pity Avoidance | Does the plaintiff avoid excessive complaining or victim presentation? | |

**Step 1.2 — Determine Narrative Strategy**

Based on Step 1.1 assessment:
- **If plaintiff scores HIGH on likability factors** → Proceed with "Hero" framing as primary narrative; plaintiff testimony can carry significant weight
- **If plaintiff scores LOW on likability factors** → Flag for intensive plaintiff preparation; plan to rely heavily on 360-degree witness testimony to tell the loss story

**Step 1.3 — Document Plaintiff Preparation Recommendations**

Generate specific preparation recommendations addressing any deficiencies identified. Focus areas:
- Coaching on acknowledging remaining abilities (builds credibility for discussing losses)
- Guidance on expressing gratitude rather than bitterness
- Techniques for presenting resilience and determination
- Strategies to avoid self-pity presentation

---

#### **Phase 2: 360-Degree Witness Analysis**

**Step 2.1 — Map the Witness Circles**

Systematically identify potential witnesses in each concentric circle:

| Circle | Category | Potential Witnesses | Contact Info | Notes |
|--------|----------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | Immediate Family | Spouse, parents, children | | |
| 2 | Extended Family | Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins | | |
| 3 | Close Friends | Long-term friends, close social contacts | | |
| 4 | Co-workers/Colleagues | Workplace relationships | | |
| 5 | Neighbors | Current and former neighbors | | |
| 6 | Casual Acquaintances | Coaches, church members, regular vendors, service providers | | |

**Step 2.2 — Identify "The Delta" (Before/After Changes)**

For each potential witness, document observable changes they could testify about:

| Change Category | Specific Observable Change | Best Witness(es) | Testimony Potential |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Lost Activities | Activities plaintiff no longer participates in | | |
| Personality Changes | Observable shifts (e.g., outgoing → withdrawn) | | |
| Physical Limitations | Visible struggles with tasks | | |
| Family Dynamic Changes | Altered roles and relationships | | |
| Specific Pain Incidents | Moments witnessing visible pain/struggle | | |

**Step 2.3 — Prioritize Witnesses by Credibility**

Rank witnesses using these criteria:
1. **Disinterest** — No financial stake in outcome (higher = better)
2. **Specificity** — Can provide concrete "slice of life" details (higher = better)
3. **Articulateness** — Ability to communicate clearly (higher = better)
4. **Authenticity** — Presents as trustworthy and genuine (higher = better)

**Priority Categories:**
- **Tier 1 (Essential):** Disinterested witnesses with specific, compelling observations
- **Tier 2 (Strong):** Family members with unique perspectives on the delta
- **Tier 3 (Supporting):** Witnesses with limited but useful observations

**Step 2.4 — Identify "Newspaper Vendor" Opportunities**

Flag any witnesses who represent unexpected, emotionally resonant testimony opportunities:
- Look for witnesses from outer circles (acquaintances, service providers)
- Identify witnesses who observed specific, memorable "slice of life" moments
- Prioritize witnesses who can illustrate abstract losses (like cognitive deficits) through concrete anecdotes

---

#### **Phase 3: Narrative Framing Development**

**Step 3.1 — Apply Hero vs. Victim Framework**

| Element | Victim Frame (AVOID) | Hero Frame (USE) |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|
| Focus | What was lost | What remains and the fight to preserve it |
| Tone | Plea for pity | Inspiration for admiration |
| Plaintiff Role | Helpless sufferer | Courageous fighter |
| Jury Response Sought | Sympathy | Support and respect |

**Step 3.2 — Develop Heroic Narrative Themes**

Identify 2-3 core themes that illustrate the plaintiff's heroic struggle:

| Theme | Supporting Evidence | Key Witnesses | Emotional Impact |
|-------|---------------------|---------------|------------------|
| | | | |
| | | | |
| | | | |

Example themes:
- "Despite [injury], plaintiff continues to [activity] because [relationship/value] is too important to lose"
- "Plaintiff endures [hardship] daily in order to [maintain/preserve] [important element of life]"

**Step 3.3 — Flag Credibility Risks**

Identify any elements that could trigger jury skepticism:

| Red Flag | Present? | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Medical providers who may appear to "stretch the truth" | | |
| Potential for inflated damage demands | | |
| Unaddressed case weaknesses | | |
| Inconsistencies in plaintiff's presentation | | |

---

#### **Phase 4: Anchoring Analysis (General → Special Damages Conversion)**

**Step 4.1 — Identify Quantifiable Lost Activities**

Review all lost activities and assess anchoring potential:

| Lost Activity | Can Be Replaced by Paid Service? | Market Rate | Frequency | Duration |
|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| | | | | |

**Step 4.2 — Calculate Anchoring Values**

For each quantifiable loss:

```
Anchoring Value = Market Rate × Frequency × Life Expectancy (or relevant period)
```

**Anchoring Calculation Worksheet:**

| Category | Lost Activity | Market Replacement | Rate | Freq/Year | Years | Total Anchor |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|------|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Household Services | | | $ | | | $ |
| Caregiving | | | $ | | | $ |
| Transportation | | | $ | | | $ |
| Hobbies/Skills | | | $ | | | $ |
| Social Activities | | | $ | | | $ |
| **TOTAL ANCHOR VALUE** | | | | | | **$** |

**Step 4.3 — Develop Anchoring Argument**

Structure the anchoring argument:
1. **Baseline:** The calculated anchor value represents the minimum, quantifiable replacement cost
2. **Argument:** The personal joy, fulfillment, and meaning derived from these activities far exceeds the commercial replacement cost
3. **Conclusion:** A fair award for non-economic damages must exceed the anchor value

---

#### **Phase 5: Package Assembly**

**Step 5.1 — Compile Non-Economic Damages Development Package**

Assemble all outputs into a structured package:

1. **Executive Summary** — Key findings and recommendations
2. **Plaintiff Presentation Assessment** — Likability evaluation and preparation recommendations
3. **360-Degree Witness Analysis** — Complete witness inventory with prioritization
4. **Narrative Strategy** — Hero framing themes and supporting evidence
5. **Anchoring Analysis** — Quantified replacement costs with calculations
6. **Risk Assessment** — Credibility concerns and mitigation strategies
7. **Recommended Non-Economic Damages Range** — Based on anchoring analysis plus qualitative factors

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks

- [ ] All six witness circles have been systematically explored
- [ ] At least 2-3 disinterested witnesses identified (or gap documented)
- [ ] Plaintiff preparation assessment completed with specific recommendations
- [ ] Hero narrative themes are supported by documentary evidence
- [ ] All anchoring calculations use verifiable market rates
- [ ] Life expectancy figures are sourced from medical or actuarial data
- [ ] Case weaknesses have been identified and flagged

#### Red Flags — Escalate to Attorney

| Red Flag | Action Required |
|----------|-----------------|
| No disinterested witnesses available | Attorney must evaluate alternative proof strategies |
| Plaintiff presents significant likability concerns | Attorney must assess plaintiff preparation feasibility |
| Pre-existing conditions may complicate causation | Attorney must evaluate medical expert needs |
| Anchoring calculations exceed $500,000 | Attorney must verify reasonableness |
| Significant credibility risks identified | Attorney must develop mitigation strategy |
| Inconsistencies between medical records and claimed losses | Attorney must investigate before proceeding |

#### Ethical Safeguards

- **Never suggest fabricating or exaggerating losses** — All identified losses must be supported by evidence
- **Never coach witnesses on content** — Witness preparation focuses on clarity and specificity, not creating testimony
- **Never present anchoring values as precise damages figures** — Anchoring provides a rational starting point, not a definitive valuation
- **Always acknowledge case weaknesses** — Hiding weaknesses destroys credibility
