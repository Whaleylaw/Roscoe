# Medical & Property Damages Documentation

## Operational Workflow

---

### Workflow Name
**Damages Documentation & Substantiation Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means producing a comprehensive, organized, and strategically defensible damages package that:
1. Documents all past medical expenses with itemized verification
2. Proactively addresses pre-existing condition defenses
3. Quantifies future medical needs with appropriate expert support
4. Captures all recoverable property damage components
5. Passes quality assurance review with zero critical gaps

---

### When to Use
Activate this workflow when:
- Building the medical damages component of a personal injury case
- Preparing a demand package for settlement negotiations
- Responding to defense discovery requests related to damages
- Calculating total economic damages for mediation or trial preparation
- Reviewing case documentation for completeness before deadlines
- Flagging life care plan requirements for permanent injury cases

---

### Inputs Required

- [ ] All available medical records (treating providers, specialists, emergency care)
- [ ] Itemized bills from all healthcare providers
- [ ] Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms from health insurers
- [ ] Out-of-pocket expense receipts (co-pays, medications, equipment)
- [ ] Mileage logs for medical appointments
- [ ] Home modification receipts (if applicable)
- [ ] Prior medical records (2-5 years pre-incident)
- [ ] Witness statements (family, friends, co-workers)

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Past Medical Expenses Documentation**

**Step 1.1 — Compile Complete Documentation**
- Collect itemized bills from ALL healthcare providers (not summary statements)
- Obtain medical records documenting each treatment episode
- Gather all Explanation of Benefits (EOB) forms from insurers
- Compile receipts for out-of-pocket expenses:
  - Co-pays and deductibles
  - Prescription and OTC medications
  - Medical equipment (braces, crutches, shower seats)
- Request mileage logs or create detailed travel expense documentation
- Obtain receipts for home modifications (ramps, grab bars, etc.)

**Step 1.2 — Create Medical Chronology**
- Build a chronological table with columns:
  - Date of Service
  - Healthcare Provider
  - Type of Treatment/Service Rendered
- Start in spreadsheet format for sorting and gap analysis
- Sort by date to create master timeline
- Sort by provider to verify complete records from each source
- Sort by treatment type to identify patterns and treatment phases

**Step 1.3 — Apply Collateral Source Analysis**
- For each medical expense, identify:
  - Total Billed Amount (from itemized bills)
  - Amount Paid by Insurance (from EOBs)
  - Write-off/Adjustment Amount (difference)
- Calculate claim value using full billed amounts (per collateral source rule)
- Note: Document jurisdictional variations if applicable
- Flag any missing EOBs that could undermine collateral source arguments

---

#### **Phase 2: Pre-Existing Conditions Strategy**

**Step 2.1 — Gather Prior Medical History**
- Request medical records from 2-5 years before incident
- Identify all prior complaints, diagnoses, and treatments
- Document baseline functional status before incident
- Map any prior imaging showing degenerative changes

**Step 2.2 — Analyze and Differentiate**
- Compare pre-incident symptoms/conditions to post-incident presentation
- Identify whether injury is:
  - New traumatic injury (distinct from prior conditions)
  - Aggravation of pre-existing condition
  - Acceleration of degenerative process
- Note changes in pain location, intensity, and functional limitation

**Step 2.3 — Apply Legal Doctrines**
- Assess applicability of Eggshell Plaintiff Doctrine:
  - Did pre-existing vulnerability increase susceptibility?
  - Defendant liable for full harm even if plaintiff was fragile
- Distinguish from "Crumbling Skull" scenarios:
  - Was condition already deteriorating toward same outcome?
  - If so, liability limited to acceleration damages only

**Step 2.4 — Build "Before and After" Narrative**
- Collect witness statements from disinterested parties (family, friends, co-workers)
- Document functional abilities before incident
- Contrast with current limitations and quality of life impact
- Prepare expert causation opinion addressing pre-existing conditions
- Draft demand letter section proactively addressing defense arguments

---

#### **Phase 3: Future Medical Expenses**

**Step 3.1 — Identify Future Care Needs**
- Review treating physician recommendations for ongoing care
- Document anticipated needs with "reasonable probability" (not mere "possibility"):
  - Future surgeries or corrective procedures
  - Ongoing pain management (injections, medications)
  - Physical/occupational therapy and rehabilitation
  - Long-term prescription medications
  - Medical equipment replacement cycles
  - Home healthcare or attendant care needs

**Step 3.2 — Assess Life Care Plan Requirement**
- Evaluate whether case warrants Life Care Plan:
  - Catastrophic injury
  - Permanent impairment
  - Long-term or lifetime care needs
- If required, identify appropriate expert:
  - Certified life care planner
  - Rehabilitation nurse
  - Physiatrist (PM&R specialist)

**Step 3.3 — Document Life Care Plan Components**
- Ensure plan includes:
  - Detailed catalog of all anticipated treatments/services/equipment
  - Frequency and duration specifications
  - Cost estimates based on current local market rates
  - Projections over full life expectancy (reference U.S. Life Tables)
  - Medical cost inflation factors

**Step 3.4 — Obtain Economic Analysis**
- Coordinate with forensic economist for present value calculation
- Account for discount rates and inflation
- Document methodology for defensibility

---

#### **Phase 4: Property Damage**

**Step 4.1 — Determine Damage Category**
- Obtain repair estimates
- Determine Fair Market Value (FMV) of vehicle pre-accident
- Calculate whether:
  - **Repairable**: Cost of repairs to restore pre-accident condition
  - **Total Loss**: Repairs exceed FMV; claim based on FMV

**Step 4.2 — Compile Additional Recoverable Damages**
- Towing and storage fees
- Rental vehicle costs (reasonably similar vehicle)
- Loss of use damages (even without rental)
- Sales tax and registration fees (for total loss replacement)

**Step 4.3 — Assess Diminution in Value (DV) Claim**
- Check jurisdictional limitations on DV claims
- If permitted, obtain automotive appraiser expert
- Document reduction in resale value despite proper repairs
- Prepare DV report before issuing property damage demand

---

#### **Phase 5: Quality Assurance Review**

**Step 5.1 — Pre-Submission Completeness Check**
- [ ] All medical records included for every claimed cost
- [ ] All itemized bills collected (not summary statements)
- [ ] All EOBs obtained to prove full billed amounts
- [ ] All out-of-pocket receipts documented
- [ ] Documents organized chronologically by provider
- [ ] Documents Bates-stamped for professional presentation
- [ ] Medical chronology/summary prepared for reviewer guidance

**Step 5.2 — Causation Verification**
- [ ] Clear medical opinion linking all expenses to incident
- [ ] Billing codes (CPT) reviewed for accuracy
- [ ] Diagnosis codes (ICD) consistent throughout records
- [ ] Future care supported by "reasonable probability" language

**Step 5.3 — Gap Analysis**
- [ ] Prior medical records obtained (2-5 years pre-incident)
- [ ] Work restrictions clearly stated (not vague "should rest")
- [ ] All EOBs collected for collateral source support
- [ ] Pre-existing conditions proactively addressed

**Step 5.4 — Red Flag Review**
- [ ] Treatment gaps explained in narrative (authorization delays, family emergencies, planned recovery)
- [ ] Passive therapy balanced with active/functional restoration
- [ ] Pain reporting consistent across depositions, diaries, and medical records

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
| Check | Criteria | Action if Failed |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Documentation Completeness | All bills, records, EOBs present | Request missing documents; note gaps |
| Chronological Consistency | No unexplained treatment gaps | Document reason or flag for attorney review |
| Causation Chain | Clear expert opinion linking damages to incident | Request supplemental medical opinion |
| Collateral Source Support | EOBs available for all major charges | Pursue insurer records; note limitation |
| Future Care Standard | "Reasonable probability" language present | Request physician clarification |

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
1. **Material treatment gap (>30 days)** without documented explanation
2. **Inconsistent pain reporting** between medical records and deposition testimony
3. **Pre-existing condition** with same complaints as current injury
4. **Missing critical EOBs** that undermine collateral source argument
5. **Life care plan needed** but not yet ordered
6. **Speculative future care** using "possibility" rather than "reasonable probability"
7. **Jurisdictional limitations** on collateral source or DV claims requiring legal analysis
8. **Crumbling skull vs. eggshell plaintiff** distinction unclear—requires legal determination

#### Escalation Protocol
- **Low Priority**: Missing non-critical receipts → Note in file; continue
- **Medium Priority**: Documentation gaps → Flag for attorney review at next checkpoint
- **High Priority**: Causation ambiguity or pre-existing condition complexity → Immediate attorney consultation before proceeding

## Quick Reference: Key Formulas & Thresholds

### Collateral Source Calculation
```
Claim Amount = Total Billed Amount (NOT Amount Paid by Insurance)
Example: Hospital bills $50,000; insurance pays $22,000 → Claim $50,000
```

### Pre-Existing Conditions Timeline
```
Prior Records Required: 2-5 years before incident date
```

### Future Care Legal Standard
```
Required: "Reasonable probability" or "Reasonable certainty"
Insufficient: "Possibility"
```

### Treatment Gap Red Flag
```
Unexplained gap > 30 days → Requires narrative explanation
```

### Life Care Plan Triggers
- Catastrophic injury
- Permanent impairment
- Lifetime care requirements
- Multiple future surgeries anticipated
- Significant medical equipment needs

### Property Damage Decision Tree
```
If (Repair Cost > Fair Market Value) → Total Loss → Claim FMV
Else → Repairable → Claim Repair Cost
```
