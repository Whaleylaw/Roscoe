Government Health Benefits: A Procedural Guide to Medicare, Medicaid, VA & TRICARE Liens

1.0 Overview & Purpose

This training module provides a procedural framework for managing reimbursement claims from government-provided health benefit programs. Unlike private insurance liens, which are primarily governed by contract law, benefits provided by Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and TRICARE are governed by unique statutory frameworks. These statutes grant them powerful recovery rights, often referred to as "super liens," which create significant legal and financial risks for both the clients we serve and for our legal representatives.

As an AI Paralegal, your role in managing these liens is critical. The purpose of this guide is to equip you with the foundational knowledge and procedural checklists necessary to ensure compliance, protect our clients, and mitigate firm liability. Your key responsibilities include:

* Risk Mitigation: You must diligently identify and resolve government liens to avoid severe penalties. Medicare, under the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA), has a private right of action that allows it to sue attorneys and their firms directly for reimbursement. Failure to satisfy a valid Medicare claim can result in liability for double the amount of the original lien.
* Procedural Accuracy: Each government program has a distinct and complex resolution process. This guide will outline the specific steps required to report claims, dispute charges, and finalize payments for each entity, ensuring that we follow the correct procedures every time.
* Client Protection: A primary objective is to safeguard our clients' financial well-being. This includes not only maximizing their net recovery but also preserving their eligibility for essential, needs-based programs like Medicaid, which can be jeopardized by a personal injury settlement if not handled with proper planning.

This guide begins with the foundational legal concepts that empower these government liens before transitioning to practical, step-by-step procedures for handling them.

2.0 Key Legal Concepts and Rules

A thorough understanding of the legal authority behind each government program is essential for effective lien resolution. While all these entities seek reimbursement from personal injury settlements, the rules, rights, and resolution processes that govern them are distinct. This section will dissect the specific rules governing Medicare, Medicaid, the VA, and TRICARE.

2.1 Medicare

2.1.1 Eligibility and the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA)

Medicare is a federal health insurance program. Eligibility is not limited to individuals aged 65 and older; it also extends to individuals under 65 who qualify for Social Security Disability benefits and have received those benefits for 24 consecutive months. You must be vigilant for clients who may become eligible during the case, such as those who receive a "back award" of disability benefits, which can retroactively trigger the 24-month qualification period.

The foundation of Medicare's recovery right is the Medicare Secondary Payer Act (MSPA). This act's purpose was to shift the financial burden of injury-related care from the American taxpayer (via the Medicare Trust Fund) to the responsible primary payers, such as a tortfeasor's liability insurance. The MSPA establishes Medicare as a "secondary payer," meaning primary plans must pay first. This is why its recovery rights are so aggressive, granting Medicare "super lien" status, which includes:

* A federal right of reimbursement for any payments it makes related to the injury.
* A "private right of action" to recover its payments directly from beneficiaries, insurers, and even attorneys who have received settlement funds. This right includes the ability to seek double damages if reimbursement is not made.

2.1.2 Medicare Conditional Payments

When a primary payer does not make a payment promptly, Medicare will often pay for injury-related medical care to ensure the beneficiary receives treatment. These are known as "conditional payments." They are made on the explicit condition that Medicare will be reimbursed from any subsequent settlement, judgment, or award related to the injury.

2.1.3 Understanding Medicare Parts A, B, C, and D

Medicare is divided into several parts, and it is crucial to understand which parts have provided benefits, as this dictates who must be contacted for reimbursement.

* Part A: Covers inpatient hospital care.
* Part B: Covers physician services and outpatient care.
* Part C (Medicare Advantage): These are private insurance plans that administer Medicare benefits. Critically, these private plans possess the same powerful recovery rights as traditional Medicare and must be contacted separately to resolve their reimbursement claims.
* Part D: These are private insurance plans that provide prescription drug coverage. Like Part C plans, they have their own recovery rights and must be addressed independently.

Identifying these plans used to be a significant challenge, but the PAID Act now allows the primary insurance carrier to query a federal database to identify all Part C and D plans the claimant has been enrolled in for the past three years. You must ensure this information is requested and acted upon.

2.1.4 Reductions, Waivers, and Compromises

Several mechanisms exist for reducing a final Medicare lien amount.

* Procurement Costs: Medicare's recovery is automatically reduced by a pro-rata share of the attorney's fees and costs incurred to obtain the settlement. This is a statutory incorporation of the Common Fund Doctrine, recognizing that the attorney's work created the fund from which Medicare is being repaid.
* Waivers: A waiver is a request to have the entire Medicare debt eliminated. A waiver request can only be filed after a final demand for payment has been issued. Be aware that interest on the debt continues to accrue even while a waiver request is pending or on appeal. This must be communicated to the client.
* Compromises: A compromise is a request to reduce the debt owed. Unlike a waiver, a compromise can be requested at any time during the process. However, decisions on compromise requests cannot be appealed.
* $750 Threshold: As of 2025, Medicare generally will not seek recovery on settlements of $750 or less, though exceptions exist for certain cases involving ingestion, implantation, or exposure.

2.1.5 The Final Conditional Payment (CP) Process

The Final CP Process is an online-only option available through the Medicare portal that provides certainty regarding the final lien amount. It allows a party to request and receive a final, locked-in demand amount up to three days before a settlement is finalized. The process is subject to a strict 120-day timeline for completion.

2.2 Medicaid

2.2.1 Needs-Based Eligibility and State Variation

Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that provides health coverage to low-income individuals. Because it is administered at the state level, the reimbursement rules and procedures are unique to each state.

Medicaid is a "needs-based program," meaning eligibility is contingent on meeting strict financial criteria, including asset and income limits. This creates a significant challenge in personal injury cases, as a lump-sum settlement can push a recipient's assets above the state's threshold and cause them to lose their benefits if not handled with proper planning.

2.2.2 Reimbursement Rights

State Medicaid programs are entitled to reimbursement from personal injury recoveries for any accident-related medical expenses they have paid. The Supreme Court's decision in Gallardo v. Marstiller confirmed that Medicaid's recovery rights are broad, allowing states to seek reimbursement from settlement amounts allocated to both past and future medical expenses. This decision is critical because it prevents parties from artificially allocating settlement funds away from "past medicals" to shield them from Medicaid's recovery claim, closing a significant loophole.

2.3 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)

2.3.1 Reimbursement for Tort-Related Care

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is entitled to reimbursement for the cost of medical care it provides to a veteran when their injuries were caused by a tortfeasor's negligence. The VA will assert a subrogation claim for these costs.

While the VA generally works collaboratively with the veteran's counsel, it typically will not reduce its billed charges. However, formal requests for a compromise or waiver can be submitted for consideration.

2.4 TRICARE

2.4.1 Coverage for Military Families

TRICARE is a distinct health benefit program that provides coverage for active and retired military service members and their families. It is important to remember that TRICARE is a separate entity from Medicare and the VA. Resolving a potential TRICARE lien requires a separate search and a direct contact process with the appropriate TRICARE recovery contractor.

Having reviewed the legal foundations, we will now turn to the practical, step-by-step procedures for identifying and resolving these complex liens.

3.0 Practical Checklists and Procedures

Translating these legal rules into consistent, practical workflows is crucial for effective and compliant lien resolution. This section provides actionable checklists and decision trees for you, the AI Paralegal, to use at different stages of a case to ensure no step is missed.

3.1 Government Lien Identification Checklist (At Case Intake)

At the very beginning of every case, you must confirm the following information to identify all potential government health benefit liens.

* [ ] Is the client currently a Medicare beneficiary?
* [ ] Is the client reasonably expected to become a Medicare beneficiary within 30 months (e.g., due to age or disability status)?
* [ ] Is the client a current Medicaid recipient? If so, in which state?
* [ ] Is the client a veteran who has received or may receive treatment at a VA facility for their injuries?
* [ ] Is the client an active or retired military service member or family member covered by TRICARE?

3.2 Medicare Conditional Payment Resolution Workflow

The following is the standard step-by-step process for resolving a traditional Medicare (Part A/B) conditional payment lien.

1. Report the Case: As soon as a personal injury claim is initiated for a Medicare beneficiary, the case must be reported to the Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center (BCRC) through the online Medicare portal. This officially notifies Medicare of its potential reimbursement interest.
2. Request Conditional Payment Letter (CPL): After reporting, request the initial CPL. This letter will provide an itemized list of all payments Medicare has made to date that it believes are related to the injury.
3. Dispute Unrelated Charges: Meticulously audit the CPL's itemization. Initiate formal disputes through the portal to remove any charges unrelated to the litigated injury, such as treatments for pre-existing conditions.
4. Negotiate Final Resolution: Once a settlement amount is agreed upon in principle, you must obtain a final demand letter from Medicare. At this stage, you have several options:
  * Pay the demand less the automatic pro-rata reduction for procurement costs (attorney's fees and expenses).
  * Request a formal Compromise if there are grounds (e.g., hardship, limited policy) to seek a further reduction in the final amount.
  * File for a Waiver if the client meets hardship criteria and a final demand has been issued.
5. Ensure Timely Payment: The final demand must be paid promptly to avoid the accrual of interest and potential direct legal action against the firm for recovery.

3.3 Medicare Contact Procedures

It is essential to contact the correct entity for different Medicare-related claims. Use this table as a guide:

Lien/Claim Type	Primary Contact Entity
Part A/B Conditional Payments (Liability/PI Case)	Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center (BCRC)
Part A/B Conditional Payments (Workers' Comp/No-Fault)	Commercial Repayment Center (CRC)
Part C (Medicare Advantage) Reimbursement	The specific private insurance plan administering the benefits.
Part D (Prescription Drug) Reimbursement	The specific private insurance plan administering the benefits.

3.4 Medicaid Eligibility Preservation Checklist & Decision Tree

When a Medicaid recipient receives a settlement, preserving their future eligibility is a primary concern. The following tools will help guide the planning process.

3.4.1 Preservation Checklist

Before determining a strategy, consider the following:

* [ ] Confirm the client's current asset and income levels.
* [ ] Identify the client's state-specific Medicaid asset and income thresholds.
* [ ] Determine the client's age (under 65 or 65 and older).
* [ ] Evaluate if a "spend down" strategy is feasible within the required timeframe.
* [ ] Determine if a trust is the most appropriate strategy to shield the settlement funds.

3.4.2 Planning Strategy Decision Tree

Use this logic to determine the appropriate preservation strategy:

* Is the beneficiary age 64 or younger?
  * If YES, the primary strategy is establishing a Special Needs Trust (SNT).
* Is the beneficiary age 65 or older?
  * If YES, the primary strategy is establishing a Pooled or Community Trust.
* Is the settlement amount small and can it be spent on exempt assets within the month of receipt?
  * If YES, a Spend Down strategy may be appropriate.

The next section details the specific data points that must be captured to execute these procedures effectively.

4.0 Critical Data Points the AI Paralegal Must Capture

Accurate and comprehensive data collection is the foundation of compliant and efficient lien resolution. For every client, you must systematically capture and track the following key data points.

* For All Clients:
  * Client age and date of birth.
  * Date of injury.
* For Medicare:
  * Medicare beneficiary status (current, or reasonably expected within 30 months).
  * Medicare Health Insurance Claim Number (HICN) or Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI).
  * Name of any Medicare Part C (Advantage) or Part D plans.
  * Final conditional payment demand amount and payment deadline.
* For Medicaid:
  * Medicaid eligibility status (current or pending).
  * Name of the state-specific Medicaid program (e.g., TennCare, Medi-Cal).
  * The state's current asset and income thresholds for eligibility.
* For VA / TRICARE:
  * VA or TRICARE beneficiary status.
  * Confirmation that a separate lien search has been initiated for these programs.

Capturing this information early and accurately is the first step; the next is identifying warning signs that require immediate human intervention.

5.0 Red Flags and Escalation Triggers

Certain situations present a heightened risk of compliance failure, client harm, or direct attorney liability. The following scenarios are considered "Red Flags" that must be immediately escalated to supervising legal staff for review and action.

1. Known Medicare Beneficiary with No Lien Search: A client has been identified as a Medicare beneficiary, but a lien search has not been initiated by reporting the case to the BCRC. This failure exposes the firm to direct liability for double damages.
2. Medicaid Recipient Nearing Settlement Without a Plan: A client who receives Medicaid is approaching a settlement, but no eligibility preservation plan (e.g., Special Needs Trust, spend-down strategy) has been established and communicated to the client. This risks the immediate disqualification of the client from their health benefits upon receipt of funds.
3. Client Turning 65 During Litigation: A client will reach the age of 65 while the case is pending. This is a critical trigger because it changes the appropriate trust type for Medicaid planning from a first-party Special Needs Trust to a Pooled or Community Trust, requiring proactive planning.
4. Disbursement Sheet Prepared Before Final Medicare Demand: The final settlement disbursement is being planned or prepared without a final, written demand letter from Medicare. This creates a high risk of underpaying Medicare, which can result in interest, penalties, and direct action against the firm.
5. Part C/D Plans Not Investigated: The legal team has addressed a traditional Medicare (Parts A/B) lien but has not confirmed whether the client also has a separate Medicare Advantage (Part C) or Prescription Drug (Part D) plan. These private plans have their own liens that must be resolved independently.
6. Settlement Involving Future Medical Care Without MSA Consideration: The client is a current or reasonably expected Medicare beneficiary, the settlement is intended to compensate for future medical needs, and a Medicare Set-Aside (MSA) has not been considered. Failing to protect Medicare's interest regarding future medicals can cause Medicare to deny all future injury-related care until the entire settlement amount is exhausted. This is a catastrophic outcome for the client and a major malpractice risk.

To solidify these concepts, the final section provides concrete examples illustrating how these procedures are applied in practice.

6.0 Example Applications / Scenarios

Reviewing practical scenarios helps solidify the application of these complex rules. This final section provides two case studies that apply the principles discussed throughout this guide.

6.1 Medicare Conditional Payment Resolution Scenario

Facts: A 68-year-old Medicare beneficiary is injured in a slip-and-fall accident and settles the case for 100,000. Attorney's fees and costs total 40% (40,000).

Resolution Process:

1. Intake & Reporting: At intake, the paralegal identifies the client as a Medicare beneficiary and immediately reports the case to the BCRC via the online portal.
2. Investigation: The BCRC issues an initial Conditional Payment Letter (CPL) for $15,000. Upon careful review, the paralegal identifies $3,000 in charges related to a pre-existing diabetic condition that are unrelated to the fall. A formal dispute is filed, and Medicare agrees to remove the unrelated charges.
3. Final Demand: After the $100,000 settlement is finalized, a formal demand is requested. Medicare issues a final demand letter for the corrected amount of $12,000.
4. Reduction & Payment: The firm calculates the automatic pro-rata reduction for procurement costs. The lien is reduced by 40% ($12,000 x 0.40 = 4,800). The final payment of **7,200** ($12,000 - $4,800) is sent to Medicare, fully resolving the lien.

6.2 Medicaid Planning Case Study

Client Profile: Jane Doe, age 58, is a Medicaid recipient who settles her personal injury case. Her gross settlement is sufficient to cover her Medicaid lien, attorney's fees, and costs, leaving a net recovery of $80,000.

The Challenge: Receiving an $80,000 cash settlement would place Jane's assets far above her state's Medicaid asset limit (e.g., $2,000 for an individual), causing her to lose her essential health benefits.

The Strategy: Because Jane is under the age of 65, her attorney advises her on the creation of a first-party Special Needs Trust (SNT). This is an irrevocable trust vehicle specifically designed to hold assets for a disabled individual without compromising their eligibility for needs-based government benefits.

The Outcome: The Medicaid lien is first resolved and paid from the gross settlement funds. The remaining net settlement of $80,000 is then transferred directly from the firm's trust account into the newly established SNT. Because the funds are in the SNT, they are no longer considered a countable asset for Medicaid purposes. As a result, Jane's ongoing Medicaid eligibility is preserved, and the trustee can use the trust funds to pay for supplemental needs not covered by Medicaid, such as accessibility modifications, transportation, and therapies.
