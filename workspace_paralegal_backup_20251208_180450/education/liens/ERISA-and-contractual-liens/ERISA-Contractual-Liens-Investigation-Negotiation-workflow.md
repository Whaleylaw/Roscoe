# ERISA & Contractual Liens: Investigation and Negotiation

## Operational Workflow

---

### Workflow Name
**ERISA and Contractual Lien Investigation & Negotiation Support**

---

### Goal
Successfully investigate and document all ERISA and contractual liens affecting a client's case by:
- Determining plan funding status (self-funded vs. fully-funded)
- Analyzing plan documents for enforceable reimbursement rights
- Identifying available legal defenses and leverage points
- Flagging ethical concerns with Letters of Protection
- Providing strategic recommendations to maximize client recovery

**Successful completion** = A comprehensive lien investigation report that enables the supervising attorney to execute an informed negotiation strategy.

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- A private health insurance plan or employer-sponsored plan asserts a reimbursement claim
- An ERISA plan lien notice is received
- Medical benefits were paid by an employer health plan and settlement is anticipated
- A Letter of Protection (LOP) is present in the case file
- The supervising attorney requests ERISA lien analysis
- Settlement negotiations are imminent and health plan reimbursement must be addressed

---

### Inputs Required

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Client health insurance information | Plan name, sponsor, policy number |
| Lien notice or subrogation letter | Communication from plan asserting reimbursement |
| Summary Plan Description (SPD) | If already obtained |
| Master Plan Document | If already obtained |
| Form 5500 filings | If already obtained |
| Itemized paid benefits | List of medical expenses paid by plan |
| Case settlement value (if known) | Total settlement or anticipated range |
| Letters of Protection | Any LOPs with medical providers |
| Client communications | Notes about provider arrangements |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Initial Identification & Triage**

**Step 1.1: Identify All Health Plans**
- Review case file for any health insurance that paid accident-related medical expenses
- Document: Plan name, plan sponsor (employer), plan administrator, contact information
- Flag whether plan appears to be employer-sponsored (likely ERISA-governed)

**Step 1.2: Review Lien Assertion**
- Analyze any received lien notice or subrogation letter
- Document: Asserted lien amount, contact person, deadline stated
- Note any threats or language regarding legal action

**Step 1.3: Set Client Expectations**
- Document that client has been informed of potential reimbursement obligations
- Note any client questions or concerns about lien impact on recovery

---

#### **Phase 2: Plan Document Acquisition**

**Step 2.1: Generate Plan Document Request Letter**
Send written request to plan administrator demanding:
1. Summary Plan Description (SPD)
2. Full Master Plan Document
3. Form 5500 filings (most recent 3 years)

**Step 2.2: Track 30-Day Deadline**
- Log date request was sent
- Calculate 30-day statutory deadline (per 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c))
- Set reminder for follow-up if documents not received
- Document any non-compliance for potential penalty leverage

**Step 2.3: Document Receipt**
- Log date documents received
- Note any documents missing or incomplete
- Flag if deadline was missed (escalation trigger)

---

#### **Phase 3: Funding Status Determination**

**Step 3.1: Analyze Form 5500**
Review Form 5500 for funding indicators:

| Schedule Present | Indication |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Schedule A** | Payments to insurer → **Fully-funded** |
| **Schedule C** | Payments to TPA/service provider → **Self-funded** |

**Step 3.2: Cross-Reference Plan Documents**
- Review SPD and Master Plan for funding language
- Look for references to "self-funded," "self-insured," or "administrative services only (ASO)"
- Document any insurance company involvement vs. TPA-only arrangement

**Step 3.3: Determine Funding Status**
Conclude and document:
- [ ] **Self-Funded** → Federal preemption applies, state law defenses unavailable
- [ ] **Fully-Funded** → State insurance laws may apply, more defense options

---

#### **Phase 4: Plan Language Analysis**

**Step 4.1: Subrogation/Reimbursement Rights**
Search plan documents for explicit language granting:
- Right of subrogation
- Right of reimbursement from third-party recovery
- **Document exact language and page/section references**

| Finding | Strategic Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Language present | Lien likely enforceable |
| Language absent/ambiguous | Potential defense—plan may lack valid claim |

**Step 4.2: Specific Fund Identification (Sereboff Analysis)**
Determine if plan language identifies a **specific fund** for recovery:
- "Settlement proceeds"
- "Any recovery from a third party"
- "Funds received by beneficiary"

| Finding | Strategic Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Specific fund identified | Equitable lien likely valid per *Sereboff* |
| General assets only | Potential defense—may not meet *Sereboff* requirements |

**Step 4.3: Made Whole Doctrine Disclaimer**
Search for explicit disclaimer language such as:
- "Regardless of whether beneficiary is fully compensated"
- "Plan's right to reimbursement is not reduced by incomplete recovery"
- "Made Whole Doctrine does not apply"

| Finding | Strategic Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Disclaimer present | Made Whole defense unavailable (*McCutchen*) |
| No disclaimer | Made Whole argument may be viable |

**Step 4.4: Common Fund Doctrine Disclaimer**
Search for explicit disclaimer of attorney fee reduction:
- "Plan is not responsible for attorney's fees or costs"
- "Reimbursement is not subject to pro-rata reduction"
- "Common Fund Doctrine does not apply"

| Finding | Strategic Impact |
|---------|------------------|
| Disclaimer present | Fee reduction argument unavailable |
| No disclaimer | Fee reduction argument may be viable |

**Step 4.5: Document Consistency Check**
Compare SPD and Master Plan Document for any inconsistencies in reimbursement language.
- Flag any material differences for escalation

---

#### **Phase 5: Letter of Protection (LOP) Review**

**Step 5.1: Identify All LOPs**
- List all medical providers with LOPs in the case
- Document LOP terms, amounts, and any special provisions

**Step 5.2: Referral Arrangement Screening**
Review for red flags indicating improper referral agreements:
- Language guaranteeing provider a "share" of settlement
- References to "agreement with the law firm"
- Provider communications suggesting special arrangement
- Client statements about being told "not to worry" about payment

| Finding | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Standard LOP | Proceed normally |
| Potential referral agreement | **IMMEDIATE ESCALATION** |

---

#### **Phase 6: Strategic Assessment & Recommendations**

**Step 6.1: Classify Lien Strength**

| Classification | Criteria |
|----------------|----------|
| **Strong Lien** | Self-funded + explicit reimbursement + both doctrines disclaimed |
| **Moderate Lien** | Self-funded but missing some disclaimers, OR fully-funded with strong language |
| **Weak Lien** | Missing reimbursement language, no specific fund identified, or fully-funded with state law protections |

**Step 6.2: Identify Available Defenses**
Based on findings, list applicable defenses:
- [ ] Made Whole Doctrine (if not disclaimed)
- [ ] Common Fund Doctrine (if not disclaimed)
- [ ] Sereboff specific fund argument (if language deficient)
- [ ] State insurance law protections (if fully-funded)
- [ ] Plan document non-compliance (if documents not provided timely)
- [ ] SPD/Plan inconsistencies (if found)

**Step 6.3: Recommend Negotiation Strategy**
Based on lien classification:

| Lien Strength | Recommended Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Strong** | Settlement timing leverage—delay finalization until lien agreement reached; emphasize litigation risk to plan |
| **Moderate** | Combine available legal arguments with practical leverage |
| **Weak** | Assert legal defenses; demand proof of valid claim |

**Step 6.4: Calculate Impact Scenarios**
Provide settlement impact analysis:
- Gross settlement: $____
- Full lien amount: $____
- Projected negotiated reduction: ____%
- Net to client (various scenarios): $____

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All plan documents requested and receipt status documented
- [ ] Form 5500 analyzed for funding indicators
- [ ] Funding status determination supported by documentary evidence
- [ ] All four language analysis elements completed with citations
- [ ] LOPs reviewed for ethical compliance
- [ ] All findings supported by specific document references

#### Red Flags Requiring Escalation

| Red Flag | Escalation Reason |
|----------|-------------------|
| Self-funded plan + both Made Whole and Common Fund disclaimed | Minimal legal leverage; requires attorney strategic direction |
| LOP appears to be part of referral agreement | Serious ethical concern; immediate attorney intervention required |
| Plan administrator failed to provide documents within 30 days | Compliance failure; attorney decision on penalty pursuit |
| Material inconsistencies between SPD and Master Plan | Nuanced legal argument; attorney analysis required |
| Lien amount exceeds available settlement | Critical case economics issue |

#### Boundaries
- **DO NOT** provide final legal conclusions on lien validity
- **DO NOT** advise client on whether to accept settlement offers
- **DO NOT** negotiate directly with plan administrators without attorney authorization
- **DO NOT** make ethical determinations on LOP arrangements—escalate for attorney review
- **ALWAYS** frame analysis as supportive work product for supervising attorney
