---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Authorization Management**

**Step 1.1 — Draft HIPAA Authorization**
- Create authorization form containing ALL required elements:
  - [ ] Specific description of information to be disclosed
  - [ ] Name of disclosing entity (e.g., hospital)
  - [ ] Name of receiving entity (e.g., law firm)
  - [ ] Purpose of disclosure (e.g., "legal representation")
  - [ ] Expiration date OR expiration event
  - [ ] Individual's signature and date
  - [ ] Statement of right to revoke in writing
  - [ ] Re-disclosure warning statement

**Step 1.2 — Validate Authorization**
- Before sending ANY authorization to a provider:
  - Verify all 8 required elements are present
  - Confirm signature is dated and legible
  - Check expiration date has not passed
  - Ensure scope covers requested records
- **FLAG**: If any element is missing → STOP and escalate to supervising attorney

**Step 1.3 — Track Authorization Expiration**
- Log expiration date/event in case management system
- Set reminder 30 days before expiration
- Request new authorization before expiration to avoid delays

---

#### **Phase 2: PHI Security & Handling**

**Step 2.1 — Technical Safeguard Verification**
- Confirm all devices containing PHI are encrypted
- Verify unique user ID and password required for access
- Ensure automatic logoff after inactivity is enabled
- Document encryption status for each storage location

**Step 2.2 — Physical Safeguard Verification**
- Confirm file cabinets with paper PHI are locked
- Verify monitors are positioned to prevent unauthorized viewing
- Ensure secure shredding/disposal process exists

**Step 2.3 — Administrative Safeguard Verification**
- Confirm annual HIPAA training is completed
- Know the firm's designated compliance/privacy officer
- Understand the firm's sanctions policy for violations

**Step 2.4 — Transmission Security**
- Use only encrypted channels for ePHI transmission
- Verify recipient email/address before sending
- Document all PHI transmissions in audit log

---

#### **Phase 3: Breach Response Protocol**

**Step 3.1 — Identify Potential Breach**
Watch for indicators:
- PHI sent to wrong recipient
- PHI on unencrypted personal device
- Lost/stolen device containing PHI
- Unauthorized access to records
- Accidental disclosure

**Step 3.2 — Immediate Response (If Breach Suspected)**
1. **STOP the disclosure** — Attempt email recall immediately
2. **ISOLATE the issue** — Work with IT to lock/wipe lost devices
3. **PRESERVE evidence** — Screenshot, document exact timeline
4. **REPORT internally** — Notify supervising attorney AND compliance officer
5. **AWAIT instruction** — Do NOT contact client or external parties

**Step 3.3 — Documentation**
- Record: What happened, when, how discovered, who was notified
- Preserve all communications
- Note recall attempts and outcomes

---

#### **Phase 4: Expert Witness Coordination**

**Step 4.1 — Expert Type Classification**
Identify expert category:
- **Treating Physician**: Patient's own doctor (fact + opinion testimony)
- **Retained Expert**: Hired specifically for case (requires full disclosure)
- **Consulting Expert**: Non-disclosed, work product protected

**Step 4.2 — Material Tracking**
- Maintain precise log of ALL documents sent to expert
- Include: Date sent, description, file names
- This list becomes part of formal disclosure

**Step 4.3 — Compensation Documentation**
- Obtain expert's fee schedule or retainer agreement
- Document hourly rate, estimated total, payment terms
- FRCP 26 requires disclosure of compensation

---

#### **Phase 5: Expert Disclosure Preparation (FRCP 26)**

**Step 5.1 — Gather Required Components**
Collect ALL of the following:
- [ ] Complete statement of all opinions expert will express
- [ ] Summary of basis and reasons for each opinion
- [ ] Copies of all data, records, information expert considered
- [ ] List of exhibits expert will use
- [ ] Updated CV/qualifications
- [ ] Publications list (last 10 years)
- [ ] Prior testimony list (deposition/trial, last 4 years)
- [ ] Compensation statement/fee schedule

**Step 5.2 — Review for Daubert Compliance**
Verify expert report addresses:
- **Sufficient facts/data**: Grounded in plaintiff's actual medical records/bills
- **Reliable principles/methods**: Based on accepted industry standards (CPT coding, recognized databases)
- **Reliable application**: Systematic, reproducible methodology

**Step 5.3 — Compile Disclosure Packet**
- Organize all materials in logical order
- Create cover memo listing included items
- Submit to supervising attorney for review before disclosure

---

#### **Phase 6: Daubert Challenge Defense Preparation**

**Step 6.1 — Identify Challenge Elements**
Common attacks and rebuttal strategies:

| Challenge | Rebuttal Strategy |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Lack of Specialized Knowledge** | FRE 702 requires knowledge/skill/experience, NOT state-specific licensure. Cite *Contreras v. Brown*. Gather full CV. |
| **Insufficient Data** | Analysis grounded in plaintiff's own records/bills. Market data aggregated via federally mandated NPI system. |
| **Unreliable Principles/Methods** | Methodology based on federally mandated CPT coding, nationally recognized databases (PMIC, Optum). Reproducible process. |
| **Improper Application** | Court's gatekeeper role is not to supplant adversary system. "Shakiness" goes to weight, not admissibility. |
| **Collateral Source Rule Violation** | Opinion based on market data, not what insurance paid. Cite *Cameron v. Lowes Home Centers Inc.* |

**Step 6.2 — Prepare Response Materials**
- Draft internal strategy memo with specific rebuttals
- Gather supporting precedent citations
- Compile expert's qualifications documentation

---

#### **Phase 7: Mandatory Reporting & Conflict Identification**

**Step 7.1 — Monitor for Mandatory Reporting Triggers**
Watch for documented evidence in records of:
- Child abuse or neglect
- Elder abuse or neglect
- Imminent harm to self or others
- Provider suspicions noted in records

**Step 7.2 — Immediate Escalation (If Trigger Found)**
- **STOP** — Do not proceed with standard workflow
- **ESCALATE** — Immediately notify supervising attorney (confidentially)
- **DOCUMENT** — Note where evidence was found
- **AWAIT** — Attorney determines if reporting duty exists

**Step 7.3 — Conflict of Interest Monitoring**
Watch for:
- Personal relationship with opposing party
- Prior professional relationship with opposing counsel/expert
- Family connection to any party
- Previous work on related matter

**Step 7.4 — Conflict Response**
- Immediately disclose to supervising attorney
- Await formal conflict check
- Do not continue work until cleared

---

#### **Phase 8: Quarterly Compliance Audit**

**Step 8.1 — Technical Safeguards Review**
- [ ] All devices with PHI encrypted?
- [ ] Unique user ID/password required?
- [ ] Auto-logoff enabled?
- [ ] Audit controls functioning?

**Step 8.2 — Physical Safeguards Review**
- [ ] File cabinets locked?
- [ ] Monitor positioning secure?
- [ ] Secure disposal process documented?

**Step 8.3 — Administrative Safeguards Review**
- [ ] Annual training completed?
- [ ] Compliance officer contact known?
- [ ] Sanctions policy understood?

**Step 8.4 — Documentation**
- Complete audit checklist
- Note any deficiencies
- Report findings to compliance officer
- Track remediation of issues

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- **Authorization Validity**: Every element verified before use
- **Encryption Verification**: Documented for all PHI storage
- **Expert Disclosure Completeness**: All 8 FRCP 26 elements present
- **Material Log Accuracy**: Cross-reference with actual documents provided
- **Expiration Tracking**: No use of expired authorizations

#### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Escalation

| Red Flag | Indicator | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **Authorization Deficiency** | Expired, missing signature, incomplete elements | CEASE use immediately → Escalate for new authorization |
| **HIPAA Breach** | PHI sent to wrong recipient, unencrypted device lost, unauthorized access | Follow breach protocol → Notify compliance officer + attorney |
| **Mandatory Reporting Trigger** | Evidence of abuse/neglect/imminent harm in records | Confidential escalation → Attorney determines reporting duty |
| **Expert Reliability Concern** | Methodology appears unreliable, inconsistent with facts, insufficient data | Escalate with specific examples → Re-evaluate expert viability |
| **Conflict of Interest** | Personal/professional relationship with opposing party/counsel/expert | Immediate disclosure → Formal conflict check required |

#### Attorney Escalation Required When:
- Any element of HIPAA authorization is missing or expired
- Any suspected or actual PHI breach occurs
- Records contain evidence of abuse, neglect, or imminent harm
- Expert methodology appears vulnerable to Daubert challenge
- Potential conflict of interest discovered
- Uncertainty about proper handling of sensitive information
