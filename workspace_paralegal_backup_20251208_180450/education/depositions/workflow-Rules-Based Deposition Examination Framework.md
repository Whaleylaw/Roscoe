# Rules-Based Deposition Examination Framework

## Operational Workflow for AI Paralegal

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Deposition Rules Framework Support Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means the AI paralegal has:
1. Identified and cataloged all potential "rules" from authoritative sources relevant to the case
2. Prepared a structured deposition outline organized around establishing rules before facts
3. Created question frameworks tailored to the case type
4. Extracted and structured all rule-based exchanges from deposition transcripts
5. Produced a comprehensive Rule Annotation Log with source citations
6. Generated trial-ready impeachment materials and closing argument foundations

---

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- Preparing deposition outlines for fact witnesses or corporate representatives
- Developing or refining case liability theory around "rules" the defendant violated
- Drafting 30(b)(6) / CR 30.02(6) corporate representative deposition topics
- Synthesizing completed deposition testimony for trial preparation
- Creating impeachment materials from deposition admissions
- Building closing argument frameworks around established rules

---

### Inputs Required
| Input | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Case Summary | Overview of facts, parties, and claims | Case file, intake documents |
| Case Type | Classification (premises liability, trucking, medical malpractice, motor vehicle, nursing home, etc.) | Attorney direction |
| Defendant Information | Corporate structure, policies, training materials if available | Discovery, case file |
| Applicable Statutes/Regulations | Relevant laws (e.g., KRS Ch. 189 for traffic cases) | Legal research |
| Industry Standards | Published standards relevant to defendant's conduct | Discovery, expert reports |
| Defendant's Own Documents | Policies, procedures, training manuals, handbooks | Discovery responses |
| Deposition Transcripts | Completed transcripts for extraction tasks | Court reporter |
| Prior Deposition Summaries | Rules already established in case | Prior work product |
| Expert Reports | Expert opinions identifying standards of care | Case file |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Rule Discovery & Cataloging**

**Step 1.1 — Identify Authoritative Sources**
- [ ] Review applicable statutes and regulations
- [ ] Research relevant case law establishing standards of care
- [ ] Examine jury instructions for the case type
- [ ] Catalog defendant's own policies, procedures, and training manuals
- [ ] Identify industry standards and published guidelines
- [ ] Review authoritative textbooks and articles
- [ ] Note expert testimony regarding standards
- [ ] Identify common-sense principles applicable to the facts

**Step 1.2 — Extract Candidate Rules**
From each source, extract rules that meet the four characteristics:
1. **Understandable**: Plain language, short, immediately comprehensible to laypersons
2. **Undeniable**: So fundamental that disagreement damages credibility
3. **Violated**: Clear evidence the defendant breached this standard
4. **Important**: Violation directly linked to client's harm (causation)

**Step 1.3 — Frame Rules as Mandatory Standards**
- Convert permissive language ("should") to mandatory language ("must")
- Ensure each rule is phrased as a clear, affirmative duty
- Test each rule: "Would a juror instantly recognize this as common sense?"

**Step 1.4 — Create Rule Inventory Table**
| Rule ID | Rule Text | Source | Source Citation | Applies To | Violation Evidence |
|---------|-----------|--------|-----------------|------------|-------------------|
| R-001 | [Verbatim rule] | [Type] | [Specific cite] | [Case facts] | [Evidence] |

---

#### **Phase 2: Deposition Outline Preparation**

**Step 2.1 — Sequence Rules Before Facts**
Structure the deposition outline to:
1. Establish general safety principles first (in a vacuum)
2. Obtain agreement on industry/professional standards
3. Lock in company-specific policies and training
4. THEN transition to case-specific facts

**Step 2.2 — Draft Rule-Establishing Questions**
For each rule, create a question sequence:
```
Q. [General principle statement]. Do you agree with that?
Q. [More specific application]. Do you agree?
Q. [Connect to defendant's duty]. Do you agree?
Q. Would violation of this rule be [careless/reckless/dangerous]?
```

**Step 2.3 — Prepare Objection Responses**
Draft response language for anticipated objections:
- "Calls for legal opinion" → "I'm asking about agreed-upon standards, customs, guidelines, or principles in [their industry/profession]"
- "Calls for speculation" → "I'm asking about the witness's understanding of [safety standards/company policy]"

**Step 2.4 — Draft Closing Gambit Questions**
Prepare the "any mistakes were made?" closing sequence:
- "Looking back, were any mistakes made?"
- If YES: "What mistakes? Why did they happen? What's been done to prevent recurrence?"
- If NO: "So this conduct was exactly as expected and trained? You'd do nothing different?"

---

#### **Phase 3: Corporate Representative Deposition Topics** (If Applicable)

**Step 3.1 — Draft 30(b)(6) Notice Topics**
Create notice topics designed to:
- Require the company to educate a designee on safety policies
- Establish company-wide agreement on rules
- Bind the corporation to official positions

**Step 3.2 — Anticipate "Know Nothing" Defense**
Prepare questions that make corporate ignorance of safety policies equally damaging

---

#### **Phase 4: Transcript Extraction & Analysis**

**Step 4.1 — Extract Rule-Based Exchanges**
For each rule-establishing exchange, capture:

| Field | Data to Capture |
|-------|-----------------|
| Established Rule | Exact verbatim text of the safety rule presented |
| Rule Source | Cited source (statute, policy, common sense, etc.) |
| Witness Response | Verbatim answer ("I agree," "Yes," etc.) |
| Response Classification | Agreement / Disagreement / Evasion |
| Transcript Reference | Page:Line citation |
| Opposing Counsel Objection | Verbatim objection text, if any |
| Case Type Context | Premises Liability, Trucking, etc. |

**Step 4.2 — Update Rule Annotation Log**
Maintain a master log with:
- All established rules across all depositions
- Source annotations for each rule
- Cross-references to transcript locations
- Status (Admitted / Disputed / Evaded)

**Step 4.3 — Flag Strategic Outcomes**
- Rules fully admitted → Strong for summary judgment
- Rules disputed → Credibility issues for trial
- Rules evaded → Possible impeachment material
- "No mistakes" responses → Closing argument ammunition

---

#### **Phase 5: Trial Preparation Outputs**

**Step 5.1 — Generate Impeachment Materials**
Create witness-specific impeachment packages:
- Rule admissions with transcript cites
- Any contradictions between witnesses
- Deviations from company policy

**Step 5.2 — Draft Closing Argument Framework**
Outline closing argument structure:
1. These are the rules [defendant] agreed to
2. Here's how [defendant] violated each rule
3. Here's how each violation caused [client's] harm
4. [Defendant] says no mistakes were made / admits mistakes

**Step 5.3 — Prepare Motion Support**
Identify rules and admissions supporting:
- Summary judgment on liability
- Motions in limine
- Jury instruction requests

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] Every rule meets all four characteristics (Understandable, Undeniable, Violated, Important)
- [ ] Every rule has a documented, authoritative source
- [ ] Question sequences are phrased in plain language a juror would understand
- [ ] Rules are framed as mandatory ("must") not permissive ("should")
- [ ] Transcript extractions include exact page:line citations
- [ ] Response classifications are accurate (no characterization beyond the record)

#### Red Flags — Escalate to Attorney
- Witness denies a rule that appears undeniable (strategy discussion needed)
- Corporate representative appears unprepared (sanctions consideration)
- Defense objections successfully prevent rule establishment (alternative approach needed)
- Witness provides unexpected response that undermines case theory
- Identified rule may have exceptions that could apply to facts
- Potential conflict between established rules

#### Ethical Guardrails
- Do not characterize testimony beyond what the record supports
- Do not invent rules without authoritative source
- Do not provide legal conclusions about liability
- Flag all analysis as work product for supervising attorney review
- Preserve exact verbatim language in all extractions
