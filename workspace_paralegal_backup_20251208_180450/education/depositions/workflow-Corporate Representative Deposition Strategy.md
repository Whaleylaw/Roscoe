# Corporate Representative Deposition Strategy

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Corporate Representative Deposition (CRD) Lifecycle Support**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means the AI paralegal has:
1. Identified appropriate strategic objectives for a CRD based on case context
2. Drafted deposition notice topics with "reasonable particularity" meeting CR 30.02(6) / Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) standards
3. Prepared comprehensive support materials for all three phases: pre-notice, notice drafting, and deposition execution
4. Produced binding corporate testimony that advances the attorney's case theory or documented compliance failures for motion practice

---

### When to Use

Trigger this workflow when **any** of the following conditions exist:

| Trigger Condition | Strategic Application |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Corporate defendant named in litigation | Full CRD lifecycle support |
| Written discovery responses are incomplete, evasive, or confusing | Deploy CRD to verify discovery compliance |
| Need to map ESI/electronic data systems | ESI-focused deposition topics |
| Complex documents or databases produced without explanation | Compel document/data explanations |
| Attorney needs to bind corporation to specific facts before trial | Liability pin-down strategy |
| Need to identify key personnel or document locations | Discovery mapping strategy |
| Attorney wants to establish "rules" or standards the corporation must endorse | Foundational rules technique |

---

### Inputs Required

**Case Information:**
- [ ] Case caption and court (state vs. federal jurisdiction)
- [ ] Named corporate defendant(s)
- [ ] Case type (premises liability, medical malpractice, product liability, employment, etc.)
- [ ] Current phase of litigation
- [ ] Discovery deadline dates

**Discovery Context:**
- [ ] Existing discovery requests and responses (RFPs, Interrogatories)
- [ ] Documents produced to date
- [ ] Known discovery deficiencies or disputes
- [ ] Prior depositions in the case (if any)

**Strategic Direction:**
- [ ] Attorney's identified strategic goals for the CRD
- [ ] Key liability theories
- [ ] Specific facts attorney needs to "lock in"
- [ ] Any court orders limiting discovery scope

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **PHASE 1: Pre-Notice Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Strategic Goal Identification**
- Review case file and current discovery posture
- Consult with attorney to identify primary strategic objectives:
  - [ ] Discovery mapping / document identification
  - [ ] Discovery compliance verification
  - [ ] Document/database explanation
  - [ ] Liability pin-down
  - [ ] ESI mapping and retention policy discovery
  - [ ] Establishing foundational "rules" for trial
- Document selected objectives for deposition planning

**Step 1.2: Preliminary Topic Drafting**
- Draft preliminary list of deposition topics based on strategic objectives
- Apply "reasonable particularity" standard—topics must be specific enough that:
  - Corporation can identify the scope of inquiry
  - Corporation can select an appropriate witness
  - Corporation can adequately prepare the witness
- Cross-reference topics against case-specific facts and documents
- Flag any topics that may be vulnerable to "vague or overbroad" objections

**Step 1.3: Coordinated Document Requests**
- Prepare corresponding Request for Production of Documents
- Ensure RFP is served **well in advance** of deposition date
- Align RFP categories with deposition topics to prevent "document dump" on deposition day
- Note: This prevents opponent from claiming they need more time to gather documents

**Step 1.4: Good Faith Conference Preparation (Federal Cases)**
- Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6), prepare for mandatory good faith conference
- Document topics to be discussed with opposing counsel
- Prepare to narrow or clarify topics if reasonable objections raised
- Note: Kentucky CR 30.02(6) does not explicitly require pre-deposition conferral, but good practice suggests early communication

---

#### **PHASE 2: Deposition Notice Drafting**

**Step 2.1: Notice Header and Formalities**
- Name the deponent as the **specific corporation or organization** (not an individual)
- Include proper case caption, court, and case number
- Specify date, time, and location of deposition

**Step 2.2: Topic Specification**
- Finalize list of matters for examination with "reasonable particularity"
- Use template language adapted to case specifics (see Template Topics section)
- Organize topics by strategic objective or subject matter
- Number each topic for easy reference during deposition

**Step 2.3: Required Notice Language**
Include the following mandatory/recommended provisions:

| Provision | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| "Said deposition shall be taken by both stenographic and video methods" | Preserves maximum evidentiary options |
| "...including use as evidence at the trial in this matter" | Establishes deposition may be used at trial |
| "Said deposition shall be considered ongoing in nature and shall continue from day to day until completed, Sundays and holidays excepted" | Prevents premature termination |

**Step 2.4: Duces Tecum Attachment (if applicable)**
- If documents are requested at the deposition, attach document request to notice
- Ensure duces tecum requests align with noticed topics

---

#### **PHASE 3: Deposition Execution Support**

**Step 3.1: Pre-Deposition Preparation**
- Prepare deposition outline organized by noticed topics
- Compile key documents to reference during examination
- Prepare witness designation confirmation questions
- If using "foundational rules" strategy, draft general principle questions first

**Step 3.2: Opening Record Confirmations**
At deposition outset, ensure attorney establishes on the record:
- [ ] Witness is designated by the corporation to testify on its behalf
- [ ] Witness is prepared to testify on **each specific topic** listed in the notice
- [ ] Witness understands their testimony binds the corporation

**Step 3.3: Topic-by-Topic Examination Support**
- Track which topics have been covered
- Flag any topics where witness claims lack of knowledge (potential "know-nothing" witness issue)
- Note any improper objections or instructions not to answer
- Document patterns of obstruction for potential motion practice

**Step 3.4: Foundational Rules Technique (if applicable)**
- General "rule" questions asked **before** specific case facts
- Get corporate agreement to common-sense principles
- Then demonstrate how corporation's conduct violated those principles

**Step 3.5: Closing Record**
- Give witness opportunity to admit if mistakes were made
- If no admission, confirm their conduct was exactly as expected
- Confirm witness has no corrections or additions

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### **Topic Drafting Quality Checks**
| Check | Standard | Action if Failed |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| Reasonable Particularity | Topic specific enough to identify scope and allow witness preparation | Narrow topic; add date ranges, specific documents, or subject matter limits |
| Relevance | Topic relates to claims/defenses in case | Remove or justify connection to case theory |
| Not Overbroad | Topic does not seek "all information about X" without limits | Add temporal, geographic, or subject matter constraints |
| Avoids Legal Conclusions | Topics ask for facts, not legal opinions | Reframe as factual or standards-based inquiry |

#### **Red Flags During Execution**

| Red Flag | Significance | Response |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| "Know-Nothing" Witness | Corporation produced unprepared witness; strategic opportunity | Document on record that corporation cannot answer questions about its own policies/training; use at trial |
| Excessive "Form" Objections | Pattern of obstruction | Track objections; consider suspension to file motion to compel |
| Instructions Not to Answer | Valid only for: (1) privilege, (2) court-ordered limitation, (3) motion to terminate | Challenge invalid instructions on record; escalate if pattern continues |
| Witness Not Designated | Corporation sent wrong person | Stop deposition; demand properly designated witness |
| Document Dump at Deposition | Opponent produced documents day of | Object; note inability to review; may justify continuation |

#### **Escalation Triggers**

Escalate to supervising attorney immediately if:
1. Opposing counsel instructs witness not to answer for reasons other than privilege, court order, or pending motion
2. Corporation fails to produce any designated witness
3. Pattern of obstruction that prevents meaningful examination
4. Witness refuses to be bound by corporate designation
5. Court intervention needed under CR 30.04 for bad faith conduct
