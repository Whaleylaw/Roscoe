| **Defendant's Answer** | Key defenses raised that the expert will likely support |
| **Existing discovery** | Current interrogatories, document requests, and responses |
| **Budget/timeline constraints** | Deadlines for discovery cutoff, trial date |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Discovery Instrument Preparation**

**Step 1.1: Draft Deposition Notice with Trial-Use Language**
- Prepare deposition notice containing the required verbatim language:
  > "Said deposition will be taken by stenographic and video methods and for any and all purposes permitted by the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure, including use as evidence at the trial in this matter. Said deposition shall be considered ongoing in nature and shall continue from day to day until completed, Sundays and holidays excepted."
- Confirm video recording arrangements are included
- Calculate service deadlines based on court rules

**Step 1.2: Prepare Expert Interrogatory (CR 26.02(4))**
- Draft interrogatory requesting:
  - Expert's specific specialty
  - Complete list of materials reviewed to form opinions
  - Summary of each opinion with grounds/basis
- Note: Serve early in discovery to establish clear record of disclosure obligations

**Step 1.3: Prepare Document Request for Expert's File**
- Request the following categories comprehensively:
  - [ ] Complete copy of all file materials and notes
  - [ ] All correspondence between expert, defense counsel, and other parties
  - [ ] All draft reports created by the expert
  - [ ] Materials obtained from other experts, agents, or consultants
  - [ ] All publications relied upon (articles, treatises, studies)
  - [ ] Applicable statutes, best practices, or obligations
  - [ ] Demonstrative exhibits, models, or animations for trial
  - [ ] For data-heavy cases: native file format data with viewing software

**Step 1.4: Convert to Formal RFP with Strategic Timing**
- Convert document request to formal Request for Production of Documents
- Serve **at least 60 days before deposition date**
- This provides: 30-day response period + 30-day buffer for motion to compel if needed
- Calendar the response deadline and follow-up date

**Step 1.5: Prepare Privilege Log Interrogatory**
- Draft interrogatory asking:
  1. Have any materials been withheld from the expert's file on the basis of privilege?
  2. If so, provide a formal privilege log identifying every withheld item, the date, the author(s) and recipient(s), and the specific privilege being asserted
- Note: Failure to provide proper privilege log = potential waiver argument (cite *Baptist Healthcare v. Goodman*)

---

#### **Phase 2: Expert Dossier Compilation**

**Step 2.1: Legal & Professional Database Search**
- [ ] Search TrialSmith for prior depositions and trial testimony
- [ ] Search Crowdsource Depos / KJA databases
- [ ] Search state and federal court filing systems (PACER, state ECF) for cases where expert testified
- [ ] Document case names, dates, and parties for each prior appearance

**Step 2.2: Publications & Academic Materials Search**
- [ ] Search JSTOR for peer-reviewed articles
- [ ] Search academic institution repositories
- [ ] Identify books authored or co-authored
- [ ] Document any positions taken that conflict with anticipated testimony

**Step 2.3: Public Records Investigation**
- [ ] Professional licensing board search (disciplinary actions, complaints)
- [ ] Secretary of State business search in all applicable states (corporate affiliations)
- [ ] Bankruptcy filings search
- [ ] Tax lien search
- [ ] Note any findings relevant to credibility or bias

**Step 2.4: Digital Footprint Analysis**
- [ ] Social media review: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok
- [ ] YouTube video and podcast appearance search
- [ ] Professional website and blog content review
- [ ] Flag any content inconsistent with expected testimony or revealing bias

**Step 2.5: Compile Dossier Summary**
- Create organized dossier document with:
  - Expert biographical summary
  - Prior testimony index (with hyperlinks/citations)
  - Publication list with key quotes
  - Business interests and potential bias indicators
  - Digital presence findings
  - Conflict opportunities identified

---

#### **Phase 3: Discoverability Analysis**

**Step 3.1: Determine Applicable Rules**
- **Federal Court**: Note FRCP 26(b)(4)(B) and (C) protections for drafts and attorney-expert communications
- **Kentucky State Court**: Note this is an "open question"—cite *Newsome v. Lowe* (work-product for consulting expert) and *Palmer v. Abedi* (work-product rather than attorney-client privilege for draft disclosures)

**Step 3.2: Prepare Waiver Arguments**
- If privilege log is deficient or untimely:
  - Draft motion to compel citing *Baptist Healthcare v. Goodman*
  - Argue failure to properly assert privilege constitutes waiver
  - Request in camera review if appropriate

---

#### **Phase 4: Conflict Mapping & Question Framework**

**Step 4.1: Identify Juror Archetype Strategy**
Based on venue demographics, prioritize conflict types:

| Juror Type | Characteristics | Most Effective Conflicts |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| **Tribals** | Anti-establishment, anti-corporate, value common sense over credentials | Snap judgments, common sense violations, "hired gun" evidence |
| **Moderates** | Trust authority, defer to experts, believe in system | Violations of published standards, learned treatise contradictions |
| **Progressives** | Pro-science, identify with healthcare workers | Scientific methodology flaws, peer disagreement |

**Step 4.2: Develop "Rules of the Road"**
- Identify 5-10 simple, undeniable principles that:
  - Are stated in plain language
  - Cannot be credibly disputed by expert
  - Were clearly violated by defendant in this case
- Document each rule with supporting authority (if any)

**Step 4.3: Map Prior Statements to Current Case**
- For each prior deposition/publication, identify statements that:
  - Directly conflict with expected testimony
  - Support plaintiff's case theory
  - Contradict other defense experts
- Create "Squaring Up" question outlines with exact quotes and citations

**Step 4.4: Prepare Ten Questions Framework (Multi-Expert Cases)**
- If defense has disclosed multiple experts:
  - Develop 10 foundational questions capturing case essence
  - Questions should be asked identically to each expert
  - Document matrix for tracking responses and identifying conflicts

**Step 4.5: Identify Credential Framing Opportunities**
- Note expert's key credentials and experience
- Develop questions that weave credentials into substantive inquiries
- Identify topics where "I don't know" from this expert is particularly damaging

**Step 4.6: Timeline Analysis for Snap Judgment Exposure**
- Using file materials, correspondence, and drafts:
  - Document date expert was retained
  - Document date(s) of opinion formation
  - Note what materials were/were not reviewed at time of opinion
  - Flag instances of premature conclusions

**Step 4.7: Identify Evidence Admission Opportunities**
- List potential learned treatises (KRE 803(18)) for expert to authenticate
- List government reports/public records (KRE 803(8)) for expert to acknowledge

---

#### **Phase 5: Trial Preservation Preparation**

**Step 5.1: Draft KRE 804 Trial Designation Notice**
- Prepare written notice to defense counsel stating:
  - Intent to take deposition for use at trial under KRE 804
  - Must be sent **before** deposition (ideally 3-5 days prior)
- This neutralizes "similar motive" objection by putting defense on notice to develop testimony during deposition

**Step 5.2: Confirm CR 32.01 Criteria**
- Verify expert meets criteria for deposition use at trial:
  - [ ] Practicing physician
  - [ ] Located more than 100 miles from courthouse
  - [ ] Other qualifying criteria under CR 32.01
- Document basis for use in case defense objects

**Step 5.3: Cite Miller v. Marymount Medical Center**
- Note this Kentucky Supreme Court case affirms right to call adverse party's expert via deposition
- Include in trial designation notice if helpful

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All discovery instruments reviewed by supervising attorney before service
- [ ] Deposition notice contains exact required trial-use language
- [ ] 60-day timing strategy confirmed for document request
- [ ] All dossier sources documented with retrieval dates
- [ ] Prior testimony quotes verified against original transcripts
- [ ] Privilege log interrogatory included with document request
- [ ] KRE 804 notice prepared and calendared for service before deposition

#### Red Flags Requiring Attorney Escalation
| Red Flag | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Expert has no prior testimony in databases | Escalate—may be new expert requiring different strategy |
| Expert has been excluded/sanctioned in prior cases | Escalate—potential Daubert challenge opportunity |
| Privilege log missing or deficient | Escalate—prepare motion to compel |
| Expert's file not produced by deposition date | Escalate—consider motion to continue or compel |
| Expert disclosed very late in discovery | Escalate—evaluate objection/exclusion motion |
| Expert's opinions changed significantly from draft to final report | Escalate—important conflict material for deposition |
| Multiple defense experts giving inconsistent opinions | Escalate—Ten Questions Method opportunity |

#### Ethical Guardrails
- All analysis is supportive work product; supervising attorney makes final strategic decisions
- Do not contact expert directly without attorney authorization
- Social media findings used only for impeachment, not harassment
- All privilege arguments based on applicable law, not speculation
