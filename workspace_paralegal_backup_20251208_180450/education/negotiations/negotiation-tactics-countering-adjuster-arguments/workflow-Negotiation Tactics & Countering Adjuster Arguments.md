# Negotiation Tactics & Countering Adjuster Arguments

## Operational Workflow

---

### Workflow Name
**Adjuster Negotiation Tactics & Counter-Arguments Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successfully counter insurance adjuster arguments, break negotiation impasses, and move claims toward fair resolution through systematic evidence-based responses, strategic concessions, and appropriate escalation—while building a documented record that supports potential bad faith claims if the carrier acts unreasonably.

---

### When to Use
Activate this workflow when:
- Receiving a lowball offer and planning a response
- Adjuster raises specific defenses (pre-existing conditions, MIST, causation disputes)
- Negotiations have stalled or become unproductive
- Considering litigation filing as leverage
- Evaluating strategic concessions in comparative negligence cases
- Planning bracket negotiations to break impasse
- Adjuster is non-responsive or hostile
- Coverage disputes arise (Reservation of Rights letters received)

---

### Inputs Required

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Case File** | Complete claim documentation including client intake, incident details, liability analysis |
| **Medical Records & Bills** | All treatment records, diagnostic imaging, provider bills (total medical specials) |
| **Prior Negotiation History** | All offers made, demands submitted, adjuster objections documented |
| **Adjuster Information** | Name, carrier, stated objections, response patterns, authority tier indicators |
| **Liability Evidence** | Police reports, witness statements, photos, EDR data, comparative fault analysis |
| **Policy Information** | Coverage limits, Reservation of Rights letters, policy terms |
| **Client Status** | Current treatment status, work restrictions, permanency opinions, pre-existing conditions |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Situation Assessment**

**Step 1.1 — Classify the Negotiation Challenge**
- Identify the primary obstacle:
  - [ ] Lowball offer (below medical specials)
  - [ ] Specific defense argument raised
  - [ ] Non-responsive/stalled adjuster
  - [ ] Coverage dispute
  - [ ] Impasse requiring bracket negotiation
  - [ ] Comparative negligence considerations

**Step 1.2 — Calculate Key Metrics**
- Compute **Offer-to-Specials Ratio**: Current offer ÷ Total medical bills
  - Ratio < 1.0 = Red flag indicating lack of good-faith negotiation
- Document **Comparative Fault Exposure**: Model potential jury allocation (e.g., 0-20%, 20-40%)
- Identify **Adjuster Authority Tier**: Estimate based on offer patterns ($15K, $50K, $100K, home office)

**Step 1.3 — Catalog Adjuster Objections**
- Document every stated reason for low offers or denials
- Categorize by defense type:
  - Causation (pre-existing, alternative cause)
  - Impact (MIST/low impact)
  - Treatment (unreasonable bills, failure to mitigate)
  - Damages (subjective injuries)
  - Liability (comparative fault, no witnesses)
  - Coverage (policy exclusions)

---

#### **Phase 2: Select Counter-Strategy**

**Step 2.1 — Lowball Offer Response Protocol**

If offer is below medical specials value, execute immediately:

1. **"Paper the File"**
   - Obtain updated physician statements addressing:
     - Permanency of injury
     - Future medical needs (degenerative prognosis)
     - Work restrictions
   - Provide fresh, targeted evidence to reinforce claim value

2. **Demand Written Justification**
   - Formally request in writing: *"Please explain how an offer below the documented value of the medical bills is justified in light of the objective evidence provided."*
   - This places burden of proof back on carrier

3. **Trigger Supervisor Review**
   - Written demand forces internal supervisor review or claims "roundtable"
   - Line adjusters typically lack authority to justify sub-specials offers in writing
   - Frequently prompts revised offer

**Step 2.2 — Deploy Defense-Specific Counters**

| Adjuster Argument | Counter-Strategy |
|-------------------|------------------|
| **"Low Impact / MIST"** | (1) Emphasize vehicle stiffness vs. human vulnerability; (2) Provide photos of hidden damage (bent undercarriage, deformed seat brackets, damaged bumper beam); (3) Obtain treating physician letter linking injury to collision forces |
| **"Subjective Injuries"** | (1) Corroborate with pain journals, medication logs, therapy notes, consistent pain scale charting; (2) Before/after witness statements from family, friends, co-workers; (3) Cite jury instruction that subjective pain is no less real for being unmeasurable |
| **"Pre-existing Conditions"** | (1) Prove prior injury had resolved (discharge records, cessation of symptoms); (2) Show clear aggravation via before/after imaging; (3) Obtain physician opinion distinguishing acute traumatic changes from degenerative findings; (4) Invoke Eggshell Skull doctrine |
| **"Alternative Causation"** | (1) Document pre-incident baseline; (2) Provide medical literature supporting causation; (3) Treating physician narrative requirements; (4) Document delayed injury patterns |
| **"Failure to Mitigate"** | (1) Document medical reasoning for treatment choices (e.g., injection contraindicated due to uncontrolled diabetes); (2) Verify and document client's adherence to all prescribed treatments and restrictions |
| **"Unreasonable Bills"** | (1) Link tests to serious conditions being ruled out (e.g., CT scan to exclude intracranial bleed); (2) Provide medical necessity affidavits; (3) State client is legally responsible for full billed amount |
| **"No Witnesses"** | (1) Emphasize quality over quantity of evidence; (2) Pivot to physical evidence strength (skid marks, EDR data); (3) Highlight contemporaneous evidence (911 call timing, ER complaints) |
| **"Policy Won't Cover"** | (1) Request written proof of coverage denial basis; (2) Review policy terms thoroughly; (3) Remind carrier of bad faith exposure |

**Step 2.3 — Manage Difficult Adjuster Types**

| Adjuster Type | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| **Low-baller** | Detailed documentation, demand written justification, escalate to supervisor |
| **Non-responsive** | (1) Call management to verify reason (leave, reassignment, neglect); (2) Escalate to manager; (3) If unresolved, file suit and push for early mediation |
| **Cynical** | Appeal to human element, provide organized documentation that makes their job easier |

---

#### **Phase 3: Break Impasse (Bracket Negotiation)**

**Step 3.1 — Determine Bracket Appropriateness**
- Use when parties are far apart and standard negotiation has stalled
- Example trigger: Carrier at $90,000, plaintiff at $300,000

**Step 3.2 — Construct Bracket Proposal**
- Identify realistic settlement zone based on:
  - Medical specials and damages analysis
  - Liability exposure
  - Comparative fault modeling
  - Policy limits
- Propose bracket with high and low numbers signaling acceptable range
- Example: Propose **$175,000 – $250,000** bracket

**Step 3.3 — Signal and Execute**
- Bracket signals willingness to settle within range if carrier moves to lower number
- Use decreasing movement increments as proof saturates
- Mirrored brackets indicate zones of potential agreement

---

#### **Phase 4: Strategic Concessions (Comparative Fault Cases)**

**Step 4.1 — Model Fault Scenarios**
- Calculate realistic jury verdict ranges at various fault percentages
- Example: If full verdict = $400,000, model at 0%, 20%, 30%, 40% plaintiff fault

**Step 4.2 — Frame Strategic Concession**
- Concede partial fault only when:
  - Evidence supports potential comparative fault finding
  - Concession unlocks movement without collapsing claim value
  - Paired with strong, well-documented damages proof
- Example: "Reasoned 25% fault concession" on liability preserves damages narrative

**Step 4.3 — Calculate Net Settlement Band**
- Settlement target = Full value × (1 - Conceded fault %)
- Maintain damages narrative integrity while acknowledging liability weakness

---

#### **Phase 5: Escalation Decision**

**Step 5.1 — Evaluate Litigation Filing Triggers**

File suit when:
- [ ] Offers remain unreasonable after Lowball Response Protocol executed
- [ ] Adjuster persistently ignores documented value drivers (surgery recs, permanent impairment ratings)
- [ ] Adjuster is chronically non-responsive and management escalation failed
- [ ] Formal discovery needed (EDR data, internal policies, witness contacts)
- [ ] Need litigation adjuster assignment (higher settlement authority)
- [ ] Jurisdiction requires suit to discover policy limits (federal court disclosures)

**Step 5.2 — Document Escalation Basis**
- Create litigation referral memo with:
  - Complete negotiation history
  - All adjuster objections and responses provided
  - Documented bad faith indicators
  - Recommended litigation strategy

---

#### **Phase 6: Creative Settlement Terms**

**Step 6.1 — Explore Non-Traditional Elements**
- **Structured Settlements/Annuities**: For large verdicts or minors
- **Apologies**: As settlement component (may have significant value to client)
- **Non-Monetary Terms**: Confidentiality, policy changes, references

**Step 6.2 — Walkaway Analysis**
- **From Settlement**: Document risk management considerations for rejecting final offer
- **From Representation**: Client dishonesty protocols—if client fabricating or concealing material facts, consider withdrawal

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] Offer-to-Specials Ratio calculated for every offer received
- [ ] All adjuster objections documented with specific evidence responses prepared
- [ ] Comparative fault exposure modeled with percentage ranges
- [ ] Bracket proposals mathematically justified against damages analysis
- [ ] Strategic concessions preserve overall claim value
- [ ] Litigation filing triggers objectively documented

#### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Action

| Red Flag | Required Action |
|----------|-----------------|
| Offers persistently below medical specials after Lowball Protocol | File suit immediately |
| Adjuster chronically non-responsive | (1) Call management; (2) Escalate to manager; (3) File suit if unresolved |
| Adjuster turnover/reassignment | Contact management, provide case summary to new adjuster |
| Reservation of Rights letter received | Immediate policy review; ensure pleadings don't void coverage |

#### Escalation to Attorney Required
- Any decision to file litigation
- Strategic concession recommendations
- Walkaway decisions (settlement or representation)
- Coverage disputes involving policy interpretation
- Bad faith claim development
- Settlement offers at or near policy limits
- Any legal strategy determinations

## Quick Reference: Key Legal Doctrines

| Doctrine | Application | Tactical Use |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Comparative Negligence** | Allocates fault, reduces recovery by plaintiff's percentage of blame | Model fault percentages to create realistic settlement bands; frame strategic concessions |
| **Collateral Source Rule** | Prevents defense from reducing liability based on third-party payments | Decline to discuss third-party payments; pivot to full billed value |
| **Mitigation of Damages** | Plaintiff must act reasonably to lessen losses | Document medical reasoning for all treatment choices; neutralize with contraindication evidence |
| **Eggshell Skull Doctrine** | Defendant takes victim as they find them | Counter pre-existing condition arguments; focus on aggravation for which defendant is 100% liable |

---

## Quick Reference: Common Bracket Scenarios

| Situation | Example Bracket |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Carrier at $90K, Plaintiff at $300K | Propose $175K – $250K |
| Carrier at $40K, Plaintiff at $150K | Propose $75K – $110K |
| Carrier at $200K, Plaintiff at $500K | Propose $325K – $425K |

*Note: Brackets should be mathematically justified against damages analysis and comparative fault modeling.*
