# Personal Injury Claim Negotiation: A Comprehensive Briefing

This briefing synthesizes key insights from legal professionals Wesley Hisaw, Tony Grapho, and Dominic Sanginiti Jr., offering an in-depth look at internal insurance processes, effective negotiation strategies, robust claim building, and critical ethical considerations in personal injury (PI) litigation.

## I. Understanding the Insurance Adjuster's World

Adjusters are central to PI claim resolution, but they operate under specific pressures and within structured, often automated, systems designed to minimize payouts.

### A. Internal Processes & Pressures (Wesley Hisaw)

* Profit Motive: Insurance companies are businesses aiming to maximize profit. Their primary method is to collect premiums and minimize payouts. This inherently creates an incentive to "dissect cases, delay cases, \[and\] deny cases they should not."  
* Reserve System: Adjusters set "reserves" – preliminary financial estimates or "budgets" for each claim. These reserves are crucial:  
* They are a "glorified accounting exercise" to manage liabilities.  
* Adjusters are under pressure to keep claims "under budget" to avoid scrutiny from upper management, which can cause "lots of problems and lots of delays."  
* It's vital to provide initial high-value information (e.g., surgery bills with the initial representation letter) to ensure reserves are set adequately high from the start.  
* Claims often settle more readily at year-end as adjusters "are trying to clear out the reserves and start a fresh reserve in the new year."  
* Overworked & Underpaid: Adjusters are often "overworked and underpaid," managing "50 to a hundred files" with "strict deadlines." This pressure can lead to delays and a desire to process files efficiently.  
* Limited Training: Many adjusters lack formal "medical or legal training." They often rely on computer programs for valuation, rather than in-depth personal assessment.  
* Internal Conflicts: Pressuring the insurance company can create a "conflict potentially with the insured and their insurance company," especially with "Hartford letters" (demands to settle within policy limits to avoid excess verdicts), which can force the insurer to advise the insured to get "separate counsel." This "creates just a lot of mass chaos on the insurance side."

### B. Adjuster Psychology and Cynicism (Tony Grapho)

* Cynicism: Many "stubborn" adjusters are primarily "cynical," approaching claims assuming the client is "not very seriously injured," that "much of the medical treatment was not necessary," and "it cost too much."  
* Human Element: Despite their internal pressures, adjusters are people. Maintaining "courteousness and being polite" can help build rapport. "Appeal to the human element of a case" by presenting the client as a "real live human being."  
* Justification: Adjusters need to justify their offers to their supervisors. Providing "ammunition" and "detailed and organized" demand letters makes their job easier, increasing the likelihood of a favorable response. They want to "put that documentation in their file and they increase the offer in proportion to what you've shown in terms of support."

### C. Colossus and AI Valuation Systems (Wesley Hisaw)

* Automated Valuation: Most major insurance companies use "Colossus or similar programs like ClaimIQ and Claims Outcome Advisor" to standardize claim evaluation. These systems "have largely replaced the traditional method of having adjusters personally evaluate each claim."  
* Systematic Undervaluation: Colossus is "programmed to intentionally undervalue claims, typically by 12-20%."  
* Point System: Claims are evaluated using "severity points" for diagnoses and factors (720 diagnoses, 12,500 factors). The value per point increases with the total points.  
* Data Entry Errors: Historically, adjusters have a "0% accuracy rate for entering data into Colossus," often due to being "overworked" or intentionally missing "value drivers." This frequently results in undervaluation.  
* Demand Letter Structure: The organization of the demand letter is critical, as typically "only the first 60 factors listed in the demand are typically recorded." Include "medical codes" to make data entry easier for adjusters.  
* Value Drivers: Specific factors significantly increase Colossus's valuation:  
* Statutory Violations: Speeding, running a stop sign, etc., because they imply "negligence per se."  
* Aggravating Factors: Drunk driving (DUI/DWI) is particularly potent, as it often removes caps on punitive damages and prevents discharge in bankruptcy.  
* Scars/Disfigurement: Especially on "female clients... on their face or on their legs," and keloid scarring on males (e.g., chest). Plastic surgeon estimates for corrective surgery are valuable.  
* Objective Pain Indicators: Dramatic changes in blood pressure, or doctors documenting patient's "ongoing pain, where it's at and what scale it is."  
* Loss of Function/Hobbies: "Duties under duress" – documenting activities the victim "can still perform but only with pain or difficulty." Also, "loss of hobbies or life experiences" specific to the client's locality.  
* Psychological Injuries: "Documented psychological injuries" (PTSD, anxiety, depression) can be significant value drivers, especially with expert testimony and estimated future treatment costs.  
* Life Expectancy: Younger clients with permanent injuries receive higher valuations due to longer life expectancy.  
* Attorney Tracking: Colossus "tracks attorneys and law firms" by trial history, settlement patterns, and negotiation approaches, generating "negotiation advice" for adjusters. Firms with strong trial records tend to receive higher offers.  
* Non-Colossus Injuries: Approximately 24 categories of severe injuries (e.g., death, brain injuries, spinal cord injuries, burns, paralysis) are *not* evaluated by Colossus and should prompt a manual review by human adjusters. Highlighting these is crucial for obtaining fair compensation.

## II. Building a Rock-Solid Claim

A strong claim is built on meticulous evidence gathering, comprehensive damage documentation, and strategic presentation.

### A. Establishing Liability (Dominic Sanginiti Jr.)

* Beyond the Basics: Don't just rely on police reports. Investigate potential additional defendants (e.g., loader of an overweight dump truck).  
* Evidence Gathering:  
* Photos/Video: "Photos of the scene tell a story that cannot be shared in other, any other way." Include photos of the scene (including contributing factors like hills), vehicle damage (exterior and undercarriage), skid marks, road conditions, and security camera footage (Ring cameras, dashcams).  
* Investigators: An investigator provides "boots on the ground" to uncover information, witness statements, and camera footage. This expense is "worth paying."  
* Witnesses: "Third party perspectives are invaluable." They provide an "uninterested party" viewpoint that carries "power" with juries. Get formal statements from witnesses.  
* Police Reports: Provide an "initial roadmap." While officer's *statements* are hearsay, citations/criminal charges are valuable, and sworn *testimony* from municipal court hearings can be used.  
* Statutory Violations: Identify specific laws violated (e.g., overweight truck) as they can be "potential defendants" and "bring punitives."

### B. Documenting Damages (Dominic Sanginiti Jr.)

* Injury & Causation: "Just because you have an injury doesn't mean you have a case." Establish a clear "mechanism of injury linked to the injuries." Doctors must "opine a future care" and link it to the crash.  
* Aggravation of Injury: Embrace aggravation claims for pre-existing permanent injuries, as they may be "easier to prove than proving an entirely new permanent injury" in some jurisdictions.  
* Medical Documentation:  
* Comprehensive Records: Provide complete medical bills, records (with medical codes), and ensure ongoing treatment is documented.  
* Medical Illustrations: "Without blood guts and gore, it's hard to understand the injury." Use illustrations to explain complex injuries, and seek actual surgical photos/videos if available, ensuring doctors certify their accuracy.  
* Economic Damages: Quantify tangible financial losses:  
* Lost Wages: Document time missed, disability received, and sick/vacation time used. For independent contractors, quantify lost appointments and potential long-term customer loss (using tax documents to show typical earnings).  
* Loss of Earning Capacity: For significant injuries, use vocational experts and economists to show "long-term inability to work or earn at previous levels."  
* Cost of Future Care: Obtain doctor's opinions and potentially a "life care planner" to outline future medical needs (therapy, medications, surgeries, equipment, transportation, home care, home remodeling), ensuring costs are "reasonable and customary" and "fee scheduled."  
* Out-of-Pocket Expenses: Compile receipts for medications, medical devices, transportation, and home care.  
* Liens: Actively manage liens (Workers' Comp, Health Benefit Plans, Medicaid, Medicare) as they "will need to be paid by the Plaintiff from any recovery" and "increase the actual numbers in your case." Be proactive in confirming lien validity and negotiating reductions. Consider a "Medicare Set Aside" for future care that Medicare would otherwise cover.  
* Non-Economic Damages: These are harder to quantify but crucial:  
* Pain & Suffering: Encourage clients to keep a "journal" of daily disruptions. Mine medical records for complaints. Encourage family and friends to describe what they observe (before/after witnesses). Force clients to use descriptive words for pain (e.g., burning, stabbing).  
* Harms & Losses: Frame the impact as a loss of independence, productive work life, active social life, ability to raise a family, romantic life, and peace of mind.  
* Loss of Enjoyment of Life: Provide concrete examples of inability to participate in hobbies or normal activities.  
* Emotional Distress: Requires "treatment" and proper "providers." Be aware that claiming emotional distress may open up prior treatment records.  
* Property Damage: If photos show significant property damage, use them to "correlate the damage to physical injuries." Counter the "minimal property damage means minimal claim" argument by emphasizing the difference between car damage and human injury, and by investigating hidden structural damage.  
* Common Pitfalls: Avoid "missing documentation," "inaccurate records," "unsupported projections," and "lack of expert support." A "rock solid claim" has "no gaps."

## III. Negotiation Strategies

Effective negotiation involves strategic timing, communication, and leveraging the strengths of the case while addressing weaknesses.

### A. Strategic Timing & Pressure Points (Wesley Hisaw)

* Early Reserve Setting: Provide immediate high-value information to trigger high initial reserves.  
* Statute of Limitations: Use the upcoming statute as leverage. "They may be willing to offer a little bit more money to avoid a lawsuit."  
* Delay Tactics: Counter delays with clear deadlines. If ignored, "file suit."  
* Year-End Settlements: Be aware that "cases will start to settle normally for higher amounts around Thanksgiving and Christmas when they're trying to clear out the reserves."  
* When to File Suit: Consider filing suit if:  
* Adjuster offers are "completely unreasonable" and "can't make any traction."  
* To get a "litigation adjuster" assigned, who may "relook at the case."  
* In jurisdictions where insurance limits are not discoverable, filing in federal court may force disclosure.  
* When an adjuster "refuses to their continuing duty to reevaluate" after new information is provided.

### B. Building Rapport & Communication (Tony Grapho, Wesley Hisaw)

* Honesty & Credibility: "Be honest with the adjuster. Don't fluff them. Don't feed them crap that you can't back up." Credibility is paramount; if you say you'll do something, "be sure and do it."  
* Professionalism: "Have the claim number ready. Have the file pulled up... be organized." This "saves them time" and encourages better treatment.  
* Help Them Help You: "Largely the adjuster's hands are tied based upon what you send them." Make their job easier with organized and detailed demand letters, and they will be more likely to "assist to the extent they can."  
* Reasonable Offers: "Always ask for the highest amount that you can justify with a straight face." This means having some "justification" for the demand, even if it's high.

### C. Bargaining & Concessions 

### Demand Letter Quality: "Present a good demand letter with all your supporting documents that's organized." Binding documents, clear categorization of bills, and medical codes are all helpful.

* Lowball Offers: "Paper the crap out of everything." Provide physician statements on permanent issues, future arthritis, etc. If an offer is "less than the medical bills," ask the adjuster to "explain that to me and better yet, put it in writing."  
* Non-Responsive Adjusters: First, confirm the reason for non-response (e.g., maternity leave) by calling management. If it's a "lazy adjuster" or "overworked extensively," then "file suit" and push for early mediation.  
* Pre-Existing Injuries: Provide medical evidence showing the prior injury "had resolved prior to the current collision," or how the new incident "aggravated and made worse" the condition (e.g., before-and-after MRIs).  
* Coverage Problems: Be careful not to allege "intentional conduct" if it could avoid coverage. Understand "reservation of rights" issues in complex cases (e.g., construction).  
* Policy Limits: Discover policy limits early (e.g., via insurance search companies, federal court filing) to tailor your demand. Asking for policy limits on a "very small claim" can "lose a lot of credibility."  
* Strategic Concessions: Consider concessions on "disputed liability" cases, especially if your jurisdiction allows comparative negligence. This shows reasonableness and can lead to mid-range settlements.  
* Walkaway Strategy:  
* From Settlement: If the insurer is "completely unreasonable and refuse to acknowledge your evidence," be prepared to go to trial.  
* From the Case (as attorney): If a client is "lying to you" about material facts (e.g., pre-existing injuries), consider withdrawing.  
* Risk Management: Be prepared to "walk away" from full value in exchange for a "guaranteed resolution" to avoid the "uncertain risks of litigation." "Do you really wanna put your hands in the fate of 12 people who couldn't figure out how to get out of jury duty?"  
* Annuities: Consider structured settlements, especially for minors or large claims, as they can provide "more money than they would've got" over time and are often attractive to insurance companies due to lower upfront costs.  
* Apologies: Sometimes an apology from the tortfeasor can be part of a settlement, particularly if it satisfies the injured party's emotional needs without being used as evidence of liability.

## IV. Ethical Considerations in Negotiations

Maintaining ethical conduct is paramount to a lawyer's credibility and long-term success.

### A. Honest Assessments & Informed Consent (Tony Grapho)

* Know Your Case: Provide an "honest assessment" of the case by thoroughly knowing its "strengths and weaknesses" based on "careful review of incident reports, photographs and video, the scene of the occurrence, medical records and depositions."  
* Client Education: Clients often have "unrealistic expectations" influenced by friends or advertising. Educate them on "value drivers" (e.g., DUI, speed, surgery, scars, fractures), and factors like "venue" that impact value.  
* Timing of Valuation: Avoid giving a precise value "too early" (e.g., while treatment is ongoing) to prevent "unrealistic expectations." The ideal time is "around the time you are writing the demand letter."  
* Client's "Net": Crucially, clients must understand the "difference between the gross amount of the settlement... and the amount that they would walk away with in their pocket" after fees, expenses, and liens.  
* Obtaining Authority: "You must get your client's permission to settle the case for a certain amount of money." Document this consent meticulously, preferably in writing or even recorded, to prevent later disputes or "buyer's remorse."  
* Policy Limit Demands: If making a policy limit demand without knowing the limit, frame it as a "request to tender the policy limit," rather than an agreement to accept an unknown amount.

### B. Bluffing, Puffery, and Lies (Tony Grapho)

* Ethical Boundaries: Lawyers are bound by ethical rules against "dishonesty, deceit, or misrepresentation" (ABA Model Rules 8.4 and 4.1).  
* Material Fact vs. Puffery: While "bluffing \[and\] posturing" are common in negotiation, "an attorney may not make 'false statements of material fact to a third person.'"  
* Concealment: You "are not allowed to remain silent just because the material fact is bad for your client's case" if it constitutes intentional concealment of a *material* fact (e.g., hiding that a large medical lien has been released).  
* Credibility: "Your credibility is more valuable than any settlement." Sacrificing credibility, even on seemingly trivial matters (e.g., keeping an accidental overpayment), can permanently damage your reputation.  
* Client Dishonesty: If a client lies about a "material fact" (e.g., not being in the car at the time of the wreck), it creates an ethical "red flag." Withdrawal may be the only option.

### C. Confidentiality and Client Privilege (Tony Grapho)

* Duty to Protect: A lawyer has an important duty to "maintain proper confidentiality" regarding all "information relating to the representation of a client," both during and after the case.  
* Broad Scope: Confidentiality applies to "any information in any format," including electronic communications.  
* Exceptions: Disclosure is permitted with "informed consent," when "impliedly authorized" to carry out representation, or "to prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm."  
* Case Loan Companies: Be cautious with third-party case loan companies. Sharing client medical information without proper HIPAA authorization is a "huge problem." Limit information shared to public records (e.g., police report) and obtain client consent for anything beyond that. These loans can also create discoverable assignments and "open up a can of worms."

### D. Civility (Tony Grapho)

* Professionalism: "Civility starts with being considerate of the adjuster's time." Be "courteous, but assertive."  
* Listen: "Really listen to the adjuster's criticisms" as they may provide valuable "reality check" information that needs to be shared with the client.  
* Keep Cool: Despite frustration (e.g., adjusters dismissing egregious insured behavior), strive to "keep your cool."  
* Documentation: Maintain a "written record" of all offers, counter-offers, and client conversations to protect yourself and ensure clarity.

## V. Countering Adjuster Tactics

Lawyers must proactively address common adjuster tactics to maximize claim value.

### A. General Tactics and Counters (Wesley Hisaw)

* Document Everything: Provide "lots and lots of paper," including economist reports, photos, and current medical records, to justify settlement amounts.  
* Damage Itemization: Detail all damages, even seemingly minor ones. For "minor impact soft tissue" (MIST) cases, show repair documentation (bent brackets, total estimates) to demonstrate impact force.  
* Graphic Photos: "The more graphic, the better" for injury photos (e.g., burns, removed toes) as they are "huge value drivers" that even affect computer program valuations.  
* Overestimating Damages: Counter with "expert opinion or a doctor's report" and consider an IME.  
* Causation Issues: Address these head-on with "expert medical opinions specifically addressing causation," timelines of symptom development, "before/after medical records," and accident reconstruction experts.  
* Inconsistent Statements: Prepare clients by reviewing facts and teaching them "to listen to the question and answer the question." Request and review transcripts of any statements. Look for video footage (dashcams, surveillance) to confirm or contradict statements.  
* Fault Attribution: Double-check facts, seek surveillance/dashcam footage, and investigate social media. Remind clients about social media usage and its discoverability.  
* "No Witnesses": Emphasize that "greater weight of the evidence does not necessarily mean the greater number of witnesses." Focus on the *quality* and logical existence of evidence.  
* Nuclear Verdicts Strategy: Borrowing from defense tactics, "be the most reasonable person in the room" by admitting clear fault and having a "reasonable argument" for damages, rather than shortchanging.

### B. Specific Tactics and Counters (Michael Bryant, Paul Warren)

* "Client Failed to Mitigate Damages":  
* Tactic: Arguing the client did not reasonably lessen care/losses (e.g., refusing to return to work, excessive chiropractic care without other specialists).  
* Counter: Provide pay stubs, doctor's notes/restrictions, and mileage logs for treatment. Emphasize that the "duty to act reasonably" in treatment does not mean "perfectly." Lay foundation from doctors on the "reasonableness, necessity, and relatedness" of care.  
* "Client Did Not Follow Medical Advice":  
* Tactic: Client's actions (e.g., lifting too much weight) caused further injury.  
* Counter: Regular phone calls with clients to verify adherence. Review records for advice given. Document client's understanding and depiction of their condition.  
* "Inconsistent Statements":  
* Tactic: Witnesses/clients give conflicting accounts or turn opinions into false facts.  
* Counter: Prepare clients to answer directly. Obtain and transcribe statements to identify discrepancies. Use dashcams or other video to prove consistency or expose falsehoods. Police reports contain hearsay but can provide leads.  
* "Your Client Was at Fault":  
* Tactic: Shifting blame or alleging comparative negligence.  
* Counter: "Double check the facts." Seek surveillance, dashcams, cell phone videos. Investigate habits and social media. Review client's story thoroughly.  
* "There Are No Witnesses":  
* Tactic: Implying lack of witnesses weakens the case regardless of evidence quality.  
* Counter: Emphasize that "the greater weight of the evidence does not necessarily mean the greater number of witnesses." Focus on "nature, extent, duration, and consequences of the injury" supported by all available believable evidence.  
* "The Injury is Commonly Associated With Other Activities":  
* Tactic: Claiming other activities caused the injury, not the collision.  
* Counter: Present medical records from soon after the collision linking the injury to the MVC. Show that any prior conditions had "resolved." Use "eggshell skull doctrine" if applicable. Argue that "possible cause does not make it a likely cause."  
* "Insufficient Evidence of Causation":  
* Tactic: Targeting the causal link, especially for subjective or gradually developing injuries.  
* Counter: Physicians' notes (e.g., "lumbar strain secondary to MVC") can suffice. For high-value cases, get a "written opinion either from a treating doctor or from a retained outside expert" to show seriousness.  
* "The Injury is Subjective":  
* Tactic: Arguing the injury is not objectively verifiable.  
* Counter: Emphasize that "almost every injury has some element of subjectivity." Cite jury instructions that pain and suffering "cannot be measured by any exact or mathematical standard." Present all available evidence on damages.  
* "Your Client Was Not Seriously Injured":  
* Tactic: Downplaying severity due to lack of dramatic outward injury.  
* Counter: Have clients detail daily life impacts. Use "friends, family, and co-workers" as "effective evidence" of observed changes. Utilize expert testimony (doctors, rehab workers, PTs).  
* "Your Client's Activities Post-Incident Indicate No Serious Injury":  
* Tactic: Using post-incident activities (e.g., return to work, social media posts) to imply full recovery.  
* Counter: Investigate the source of their information. Explain reasons for activities (e.g., sedentary job, accommodations, financial necessity). Address "simple factual errors" in medical records through client's side of story.  
* "It Was Not Possible for Someone to be Injured in This Low-Impact Collision":  
* Tactic: Adjusters, despite lacking medical/biomechanical expertise, claim low impact means no significant injury.  
* Counter: Obtain doctor's letters linking injury to collision despite low damage. Cite instances of severe injury from minor collisions. Use biomechanical experts to calculate forces. Look for defendant/passenger with similar complaints.  
* "The Medical Treatment, Bills and Estimates Are Unreasonable":  
* Tactic: Challenging ER costs, extended treatment for minor injuries, or inflated future estimates.  
* Counter: Link ER tests to specific diagnoses or ruled-out conditions. For persistent challenges, state that defense will need a medical expert to argue "medical negligence." For "unreasonable bills," state client is legally responsible for the amount. For "unreasonable estimates," obtain "written estimate from a health care provider of future treatment" or cite medical treatises.  
* "Your Client is Not Out of Pocket" (Collateral Sources):  
* Tactic: Arguing that third-party payments (health insurance, workers' comp) reduce the recoverable amount.  
* Counter: Know your state's "collateral source rule" (which often prevents disclosure of such payments at trial) and refuse to discuss them in settlement negotiations.  
* "The Policy/Limits Will Not Cover That":  
* Tactic: Claiming insufficient policy limits without proof, or misrepresenting terms.  
* Counter: "Request written proof" of limits. Reference the insurer's "duty to negotiate in good faith." Request a copy of the policy.  
* "The Claim Was Not Filed Timely":  
* Tactic: Challenging adherence to statutes of limitation.  
* Counter: Compute and document all applicable statutes early. Address complexities for multiple legal theories or minors. Recordkeeping and production of tolling agreements resolve most issues.

## Conclusion

Successfully navigating personal injury claims requires a deep understanding of the insurance industry's internal workings, from adjuster incentives and automated valuation systems to common defense tactics. By building "rock-solid claims" through meticulous documentation, strategic evidence gathering, and ethical, persistent negotiation, attorneys can "level the playing field" and maximize client compensation. The overarching goal is to present a compelling narrative that demonstrates both the factual basis for liability and the full extent of the client's damages, forcing the adjuster to "act" to avoid the significant "risk and expense of \[a\] trial victory."
