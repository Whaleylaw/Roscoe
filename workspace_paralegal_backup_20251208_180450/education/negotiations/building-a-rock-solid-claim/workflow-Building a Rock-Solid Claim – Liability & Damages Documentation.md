  - Tow yards holding the vehicle
  - Adjacent businesses for surveillance footage
- Log all letters sent with dates and tracking numbers
- Set follow-up reminders for non-responses

**Step 1.2: Deploy Scene Documentation**
- Coordinate investigator to photograph:
  - All visible vehicle damage (exterior and interior)
  - **Hidden undercarriage damage** (critical for MIST defense)
  - Bent seat tracks, brackets, and internal components
  - Scene conditions: sightlines, skid marks, road conditions, debris fields

- Compile supporting evidence for each element

**Step 2.3: Witness Documentation**
- Collect full contact information for:
  - Third-party incident witnesses
  - "Before-and-after" witnesses (family, friends, coworkers)
- Obtain written statements with key quotes describing:
  - How incident occurred
  - Functional changes in client's life post-injury

---

#### **PHASE 3: Economic Damages Documentation**

**Step 3.1: Medical Expenses Ledger**
Create comprehensive ledger including:
- All past medical bills with **ICD-10 and CPT codes** (non-negotiable for automated valuation)
- Provider name and date of service
- Amount billed and amount paid
- Outstanding balances

**Step 3.2: Future Medical Costs**
- Document treating physician opinions on:

---

#### **PHASE 4: Non-Economic Damages Documentation**

**Step 4.1: Pain Documentation**
- Review client pain/activity journal for:
  - **Specific pain descriptors**: burning, stabbing, aching, throbbing (not generic terms)
  - Pain scale ratings from medical records
  - Objective pain indicators (BP spikes during exams)
- Extract medication logs showing pain management efforts

**Step 4.2: Suffering Documentation**
Document separately from pain:
- Frustration from inability to perform hobbies
- Inconvenience of medical appointments
- Emotional toll of family activity limitations
- Anxiety about future health
- Indignity of depending on others

**Step 4.3: Functional Loss Documentation**
Translate symptoms into objective limitations:
- Specific restrictions (e.g., "lifting limited to 10 lbs")
- Measurable limitations (e.g., "cannot stand > 15 minutes")
- Sleep disruption frequency
- **"Duties Under Duress"**: Activities performed but with significant pain/difficulty (high-leverage Colossus value driver)

**Step 4.4: Before-and-After Witness Statements**
Obtain statements documenting:

#### **PHASE 5: Medical Chronology Construction**

**Step 5.1: Build Four-Column Chronology**
Create standardized table:

| Date | Provider | Key Findings / Complaints | Functional Limits & Work Restrictions |
|------|----------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| | | | |

**Step 5.2: Link Complaints to Objective Findings**
- Connect subjective complaints to imaging/test results
- Document mechanism of injury causation chain
- Note treating physician causation opinions

**Step 5.3: Gap Analysis and Documentation**
- **FLAG all gaps in treatment** (adjusters view gaps as weakness)
- Document reason for each gap:
  - Insurance authorization delays
  - Transportation issues
  - Childcare conflicts
  - Financial constraints (co-pay affordability)
  - Work schedule conflicts

**Step 5.4: Treating Physician Narrative**
Obtain written opinions on:
- Causation (linking injury to crash)
- Permanency of injury
- Future medical care needs
- Any permanent impairment ratings (AMA Guides)

---

#### **PHASE 6: Special Documentation Scenarios**

**Step 6.1: Pre-Existing Condition Handling**
Two-pronged evidence strategy:

*Prove Aggravation:*
- Obtain before-and-after imaging (MRIs)
- Secure physician opinion distinguishing:
  - Acute, new injuries (e.g., new annular tear)
  - Chronic, pre-existing degeneration
- Document functional change pre/post incident

*Prove Resolution:*
- Obtain prior medical records showing:
  - Previous injury had resolved, OR
  - Condition was asymptomatic before incident

**Step 6.2: MIST (Minimal Impact) Defense Counter**
When low property damage argued:

*Document Hidden Damage:*
- Undercarriage photographs
- Bent seat tracks/brackets photos
- Frame/structural damage repair invoices
- Bumper beam deformation evidence

*Emphasize Human Vulnerability:*
- Obtain physician opinion explaining:
  - Vehicle energy absorption differs from human spine tolerance
  - Acceleration-deceleration forces on soft tissue

**Step 6.3: Delayed Injury Manifestation**
- Document timeline from incident to symptom onset
- Obtain medical literature supporting delayed presentation
- Secure physician opinion on delayed manifestation causation

---

#### **PHASE 7: Lien Inventory and Management**

**Step 7.1: Create Lien Inventory Ledger**
Track for each lien holder:

| Plan Type | Amount Paid | Amount Asserted | Legal Basis | Negotiation Status | Final Amount |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| ERISA | | | | | |
| Medicare | | | | | |
| Medicaid | | | | | |
| Workers' Comp | | | | | |
| PIP | | | | | |

**Step 7.2: Request Plan Documents**
- For ERISA plans: Request plan documents and Summary Plan Description (SPD)
- Document legal right to reimbursement from plan language

**Step 7.3: Check Public Portals**
- Regularly check Medicare/Medicaid portals for conditional payments
- Document any payments made on client's behalf

**Step 7.4: Evaluate MSA Requirements**
For Medicare beneficiaries:
- Assess whether settlement triggers Medicare Set-Aside requirement
- Document future medical expense considerations

---

#### **PHASE 8: Final Review and Quality Assurance**

**Step 8.1: Completeness Audit**
Verify presence of:
- [ ] All ICD-10/CPT codes captured
- [ ] Complete medical chronology with no unexplained gaps
- [ ] All economic damages documented with source documents
- [ ] Non-economic damages separated: Pain vs. Suffering
- [ ] Before-and-after witness statements obtained
- [ ] Lien inventory current and complete
- [ ] All preservation letters sent and tracked
- [ ] MIST defense evidence assembled (if applicable)
- [ ] Pre-existing condition evidence organized (if applicable)

**Step 8.2: Organization for Demand**
Structure file for adjuster consumption:
- Present first ~60 factors clearly (Colossus input limitation)
- Limit to ~7 most significant diagnoses (adjuster coding limitation)
- Prioritize high-leverage value drivers at top of presentation

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
| Check | Action if Failed |
|-------|------------------|
| Missing ICD-10/CPT codes | Request itemized bills from providers; do not proceed without codes |
| Unexplained treatment gap > 2 weeks | Document reason; prompt for client explanation |
| No causation opinion from physician | Request narrative report before demand preparation |
| Missing before-and-after witnesses | Prompt client for family/friend/coworker contacts |
| Incomplete lien inventory | Verify all potential lien sources checked |
| No undercarriage photos (MIST risk) | Coordinate emergency vehicle inspection if possible |

#### Red Flags Requiring Escalation
| Red Flag | Escalation Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| Pre-existing condition with no distinguishing evidence | Escalate to attorney for strategy discussion |
| Gap in treatment > 30 days with no explanation | Escalate before demand preparation |
| Adjuster asserting MIST with no counter-evidence | Escalate for expert consultation |
| Lien amount exceeds potential recovery | Escalate for reduction negotiation strategy |
| Comparative fault > 20% indicated | Escalate for liability assessment |
| Missing critical documentation after 60 days | Escalate for intervention |

#### Ethical Safeguards
- **Do not provide legal advice or final legal conclusions**
- Frame all analysis as supportive work product for supervising attorney
- Do not characterize legal liability definitively
- Present evidence; let attorney draw legal conclusions
- Flag ambiguous causation for attorney review

## 2. Prompt Template for AI Paralegal

```
You are an AI Paralegal operating under the "Building a Rock-Solid Claim – Liability & Damages Documentation" module.

Reference:
- You have been trained on the "Building a Rock-Solid Claim – Liability & Damages Documentation" report, which defines the concepts, checklists, red flags, and procedures for systematically gathering, organizing, and presenting evidence that establishes liability and proves damages.

Task:
- {{task_description}}
  Examples:
  - "Review the provided medical records and produce a treatment chronology with ICD-10/CPT code inventory"
  - "Analyze the case file for documentation gaps and generate a missing evidence checklist"
  - "Build the economic damages ledger from provided bills and employment records"
  - "Evaluate pre-existing condition documentation and prepare aggravation evidence summary"
  - "Assess MIST defense vulnerability and document counter-evidence inventory"

Inputs:
- Client: {{client_name}}
- Case context: {{case_context}}
  Example: "MVA on [date], rear-end collision, soft tissue injuries with disc herniation at L4-L5"
- Documents or data: {{uploaded_documents_or_data}}
  Example: "Police report, medical records from 3 providers, vehicle damage photos, employer verification letter"

Instructions:
1. Follow the "Rock-Solid Claim Builder" workflow step by step, focusing on the phase(s) relevant to the task.

2. Apply the following critical rules from the training report:
   - **Capture all ICD-10 and CPT codes** – this is non-negotiable for automated valuation accuracy
   - **Separate Pain from Suffering** – document physical pain descriptors separately from emotional/life-impact suffering
   - **Flag all treatment gaps** and document reasons; adjusters view unexplained gaps as claim weakness
   - **Document "Duties Under Duress"** – activities performed with significant difficulty are high-leverage value drivers
   - For pre-existing conditions: prove aggravation with before-and-after evidence OR prove prior resolution
   - For MIST defense risk: prioritize hidden damage evidence (undercarriage, seat tracks, structural damage)

3. Apply these checklists as appropriate:
   - Liability Evidence Collection Checklist (Phase 1-2)
   - Economic Damages Documentation Checklist (Phase 3)
   - Non-Economic Damages Documentation Checklist (Phase 4)
   - Medical Chronology Construction (Phase 5)
   - Lien Inventory Management Workflow (Phase 7)

4. Flag these red flags immediately:
   - Unexplained gaps in medical treatment
   - Pre-existing conditions without distinguishing evidence
   - Low property damage without hidden damage documentation
   - Missing ICD-10/CPT codes
   - Incomplete lien inventory

5. Remember the core philosophy: facilitate the adjuster's work by providing clear, organized, credible proof. An adjuster must justify every dollar to supervisors – our documentation empowers that justification.

6. **Do not provide legal advice or final legal conclusions.** Frame all analysis as supportive work product for a supervising attorney. Present evidence and flag issues; let the attorney draw legal conclusions.

Output:
- {{output_format}}
  Standard format: Provide a markdown report with sections:
  1. **Overview**: Brief summary of task completed and case status
  2. **Key Evidence Inventory**: Organized listing of evidence reviewed/gathered
  3. **Critical Data Points Captured**: ICD-10/CPT codes, causation opinions, value drivers
  4. **Medical Chronology** (if applicable): Four-column table format
  5. **Issues & Red Flags**: Documentation gaps, defense vulnerabilities, concerns
  6. **Recommended Actions**: Next steps, missing documentation to obtain
  7. **Items for Attorney Review**: Anything requiring legal judgment or escalation
```

## Quick Reference Card

### Value Drivers to Always Capture
- ICD-10/CPT codes (every diagnosis, every procedure)
- Permanent impairment ratings (AMA Guides)
- Treating physician causation opinions
- Functional limitations with specific metrics
- "Duties Under Duress" documentation
- Objective pain indicators (BP spikes, pain scale charting)
- DSM-5 codes + assessment scores for psychological injuries

### Common Defense Tactics to Anticipate
| Defense | Counter-Evidence Required |
|---------|--------------------------|
| MIST ("low damage = no injury") | Undercarriage photos, structural damage, physician biomechanics opinion |
| Pre-existing condition attribution | Before/after imaging, physician distinction letter, resolution evidence |
| Gap in treatment | Documented reason (insurance delay, transportation, finances) |
| Subjective symptoms only | Objective findings, standardized assessments, before-and-after witnesses |

### Colossus System Constraints
- Adjusters may only input first ~60 factors from demand
- Adjusters limited to coding ~7 diagnoses
- Data entry error rate documented at near-0% accuracy
- **Implication**: Present most important factors first, prioritize top diagnoses
