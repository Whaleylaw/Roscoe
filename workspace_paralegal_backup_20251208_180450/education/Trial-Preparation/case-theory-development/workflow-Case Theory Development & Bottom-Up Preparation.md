# Case Theory Development & Bottom-Up Preparation

## Module Overview

This workflow operationalizes the "bottom-up" methodology for case preparation, emphasizing jury-centric thinking over traditional lawyer-centric approaches. It incorporates "Judo Law" techniques for transforming negative facts into strategic advantages and protecting client credibility.

---

# 1. Operational Workflow

## Workflow Name
**Bottom-Up Case Theory Development Workflow**

---

## Goal
Successful completion means:
- A complete, jury-tested case theory that resonates with lay decision-makers
- Identification and strategic transformation of all negative facts ("land mines")
- A compelling trial story with clear moral core and unified theme
- Client credibility protected through proactive inoculation strategies
- All cognitive bias vulnerabilities identified and addressed

---

## When to Use

Trigger this workflow when:
- Developing initial case theory memos after intake
- Preparing focus group or mock trial materials
- Identifying case weaknesses requiring inoculation strategy
- Drafting trial story outlines
- Conducting pre-trial "land mine" audits
- Reassessing case theory after discovery produces new facts
- Preparing for mediation or settlement negotiations where case presentation matters

---

## Inputs Required

| Input | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Case file summary | Basic facts, parties, claims, and defenses |
| Discovery materials | Depositions, interrogatories, document production |
| Client interview notes | Client's version of events, background, concerns |
| Medical/expert records | (If applicable) Supporting documentation |
| Opposing party materials | Defense positions, IME reports, surveillance |
| Social media audit results | Client and witness digital footprint |
| Prior litigation history | Any previous lawsuits involving client |
| Criminal/driving records | Background checks on client and key witnesses |

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Get Facts (Comprehensive Fact Gathering)**

**Objective:** Assemble ALL facts—favorable and unfavorable—without filtering.

**Actions:**
1. Compile chronological fact timeline from all sources
2. Separate facts into categories:
   - Undisputed facts
   - Facts favorable to client
   - Facts favorable to defense
   - Facts with conflicting versions
3. Document source and reliability level for each fact
4. Identify gaps where additional investigation is needed

**Output:** Master Fact Inventory with source citations

---

### **Step 2: Jury Research (Understanding the Audience)**

**Objective:** Determine how lay jurors—not lawyers—will perceive the case.

**Research Methods (in order of depth):**

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Concept Focus Group** | Test core themes and emotional reactions | Early case development |
| **Structured Focus Group** | Present case facts, observe deliberation | Mid-stage theory refinement |
| **Mini-Mock Trial** | Abbreviated presentation to mock jurors | Pre-trial preparation |
| **Full Mock Trial** | Complete simulation with voir dire | High-value cases |
| **Jury Survey** | Statistical data on community attitudes | Venue analysis |

**Actions:**
1. Identify key factual/legal issues jurors will decide
2. Research community attitudes relevant to case type
3. Note where lawyer assumptions differ from likely juror reactions
4. Apply **Naïve Realism** awareness: Recognize jurors believe their perception is objective truth
5. Document cognitive biases that may affect juror reception

**Output:** Jury Perception Analysis Memo

---

### **Step 3: Identify Case Core (Moral Essence)**

**Objective:** Distill the case to its fundamental moral truth.

**Actions:**
1. Answer: "What wrong was done that demands correction?"
2. Identify the single moral principle the case embodies
3. Draft one-paragraph case summary that captures essence
4. Test: Would a reasonable person with no legal training understand why this case matters?

**Case Core Elements:**
- **Moral Essence:** The fundamental right/wrong at stake
- **Unifying Theme:** The single idea that ties all evidence together
- **Paragraph Summary:** Plain-language case encapsulation

**Output:** Case Core Statement (1 paragraph max)

---

### **Step 4: Frame/Reframe (Strategic Perspective)**

**Objective:** Choose the lens through which the jury will view the facts.

**Framing Considerations:**

| Element | Questions to Answer |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Point of View** | Whose perspective tells this story best? |
| **Sequence** | What order of facts creates maximum impact? |
| **Emphasis** | Which facts deserve prominence? |
| **Simplicity** | Can a 12-year-old understand the core argument? |
| **Credibility** | Does the framing survive scrutiny? |

**Actions:**
1. Draft 2-3 alternative framings of the case
2. Evaluate each against jury research insights
3. Select framing that balances simplicity with credibility
4. Identify how defense will frame; plan counter-narrative

**Output:** Case Framing Analysis (with selected approach justified)

---

### **Step 5: Apply Judo Law (Transform Negatives)**

**Objective:** Convert defense-favorable facts into plaintiff advantages.

**Judo Law Methodology:**
1. List every fact the defense will use against the client
2. For each negative fact, ask:
   - How does this fact, viewed differently, support our theme?
   - What does this fact reveal about the defendant's conduct?
   - How does addressing this fact proactively build credibility?
3. Develop inoculation strategy: present negative facts first, on your terms
4. Reframe the negative as evidence supporting the case theory

**Example Transformations:**
| Defense Fact | Judo Reframe |
|--------------|--------------|
| Client has prior back injury | Shows client's determination to work through pain; defendant made manageable condition disabling |
| Client didn't seek immediate treatment | Client tried to tough it out, didn't want to be seen as complainer |
| Gaps in treatment | Couldn't afford ongoing care; demonstrates financial harm |

**Output:** Judo Law Transformation Table

---

### **Step 6: Conduct Land Mine Audit (Credibility Protection)**

**Objective:** Identify and neutralize all potential credibility threats before trial.

**Credibility Land Mine Checklist:**

| Category | Investigation Items |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Social Media** | All platforms; posts about health, activities, lawsuit; deleted content |
| **Prior Records** | Criminal history; driving record; prior injuries/claims |
| **Surveillance** | Assume surveillance exists; reconcile with claimed limitations |
| **Other Litigation** | Prior lawsuits as plaintiff or defendant; workers' comp claims |
| **Employment History** | Job applications; disciplinary records; attendance issues |
| **Financial Records** | Bankruptcy; tax issues; debt collection |
| **Witness Background** | Same categories for all key witnesses |

**Actions:**
1. Complete checklist investigation for client and all witnesses
2. Identify items defense likely has or will obtain
3. Develop inoculation strategy for each land mine
4. Prepare client for testimony about sensitive issues
5. Consider preemptive disclosure benefits vs. risks

**Output:** Land Mine Audit Report with Inoculation Strategies

---

### **Step 7: Build Trial Story**

**Objective:** Construct the narrative that will be presented to the jury.

**Actions:**
1. Structure story using selected framing from Step 4
2. Incorporate Judo Law transformations from Step 5
3. Build in inoculation for land mines from Step 6
4. Ensure story flows logically and emotionally
5. Identify key witnesses and evidence for each story element
6. Create visual aids and demonstrative exhibit concepts

**Story Elements:**
- **Opening Hook:** Captures attention and states theme
- **Background:** Establishes characters and context
- **Inciting Incident:** What the defendant did wrong
- **Consequences:** How the wrong affected the plaintiff
- **Current Status:** Where things stand now
- **Ask:** What the jury can do to make it right

**Output:** Trial Story Outline

---

### **Step 8: Test & Refine (Iteration)**

**Objective:** Validate theory through feedback and refine.

**Actions:**
1. Present case theory to colleagues for critique
2. If resources permit, conduct focus group testing
3. Identify where story falters or confuses
4. Refine based on feedback
5. Anticipate defense attacks and strengthen vulnerable points
6. Update all outputs from prior steps as theory evolves

**Testing Questions:**
- Does the story make sense to someone unfamiliar with the case?
- Is the moral core immediately apparent?
- Do the Judo Law reframes feel natural or forced?
- Are inoculation points woven smoothly into the narrative?

**Output:** Refined Case Theory Package (updated versions of all prior outputs)
