**Purpose:**  
This report trains the AI paralegal on the systematic "bottom-up" methodology for case preparation, emphasizing jury-centric thinking over traditional lawyer-centric approaches. It includes techniques for transforming negative facts into strategic advantages ("Judo Law") and protecting client credibility.

**Intended Use in AI Paralegal OS:**  
Used throughout case development, from initial intake through trial preparation. The AI applies this module when: developing case theory memos, preparing focus group materials, identifying case weaknesses requiring inoculation, drafting trial story outlines, and conducting pre-trial "land mine" audits.
