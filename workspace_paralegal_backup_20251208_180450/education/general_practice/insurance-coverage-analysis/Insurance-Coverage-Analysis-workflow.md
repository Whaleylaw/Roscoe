# Insurance Coverage Analysis Module

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Insurance Coverage Identification and Lien Management Workflow**

---

### Goal
Successful completion means:
- All potential insurance coverage sources (first-party and third-party) have been identified and documented
- All carriers have been properly notified
- All subrogation claims and liens have been identified, tracked, and verified
- Medicare/Medicaid compliance has been established where applicable
- Critical deadlines (especially UIM notification) have been flagged
- A complete "financial architecture" summary has been produced for attorney review

---

### When to Use
- **Immediately after client intake** for any personal injury matter involving an automobile accident
- **Throughout case development** when identifying new coverage sources or potential defendants
- **Before accepting any settlement offer**, especially policy-limits offers from at-fault parties
- **When evaluating total case value** and potential recovery sources
- **When preparing for settlement negotiations** to account for all liens and subrogation claims
- **Post-settlement** to ensure all lien obligations are satisfied

---

### Inputs Required

| Input Category | Required Documents/Data |
|----------------|------------------------|
| **Client Information** | Intake form, client's auto insurance declaration page(s), health insurance card/policy documents |
| **Accident Details** | Police report, accident scene information, witness statements |
| **At-Fault Party Information** | Insurance exchange information, liability carrier details, policy limits disclosure |
| **Medical Treatment** | Medical bills, explanation of benefits (EOBs), provider records |
| **Employment Information** | Whether accident was work-related, employer's workers' comp carrier if applicable |
| **Government Benefits** | Medicare/Medicaid beneficiary status, Medicare ID number |
| **Prior Coverage Documentation** | Any prior claims or coverage correspondence |

---

### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Initial Coverage Triage (Within 48 Hours of Intake)**

**Step 1.1: Analyze the 'WHO' — Identify All Potentially Liable Parties**
- [ ] Identify the at-fault driver
- [ ] Determine if vehicle owner is different from driver → potential negligent entrustment claim
- [ ] Determine if driver was acting in course of employment → vicarious liability against employer
- [ ] Identify all passengers and vehicle occupants
- [ ] Check for fleet/commercial vehicle involvement → larger commercial policies

**Step 1.2: Analyze the 'WHERE' — Assess Location-Based Factors**
- [ ] Confirm accident occurred within policy coverage territory
- [ ] Check if accident was on private property → recreational immunity concerns
- [ ] Identify if cross-border or international elements exist
- [ ] Note any premises liability potential (property owner liability)

**Step 1.3: Analyze the 'WHAT' — Evaluate Incident Circumstances**
- [ ] Review accident narrative for intentional act indicators (road rage, assault)
- [ ] Check for DUI/criminal conduct that may affect coverage
- [ ] Assess if policy exclusions may apply (intentional tort, criminal act)
- [ ] Identify any product defect factors (vehicle malfunction, faulty parts)

**Step 1.4: Identify 'OTHER PARTIES' — Hidden Sources of Liability**
- [ ] Product manufacturers (brake failure, airbag defect, tire blowout)
- [ ] Government entities (road design, traffic signal malfunction, signage)
- [ ] Property owners (hazardous conditions, poor visibility)
- [ ] Maintenance/repair shops (negligent repairs)
- [ ] Alcohol vendors (dram shop liability)

---

#### **Phase 2: Coverage Source Mapping**

**Step 2.1: Document Third-Party Coverage (At-Fault Party's Insurance)**
- [ ] Obtain liability carrier name and contact information
- [ ] Obtain policy number
- [ ] Confirm policy limits (per person / per accident)
- [ ] Verify policy was active on date of loss
- [ ] Note any coverage disputes or reservation of rights letters

**Step 2.2: Document Client's First-Party Coverage**

| Coverage Type | Data to Capture | Key Considerations |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Liability** | Carrier, policy #, limits | Client's own policy for any comparative fault |
| **UM (Uninsured Motorist)** | Carrier, policy #, limits | Triggers: no insurance, hit-and-run, insurer insolvency |
| **UIM (Underinsured Motorist)** | Carrier, policy #, limits, reducing clause terms | Triggers when at-fault limits < client's UIM limits |
| **MedPay** | Carrier, policy #, limits | No-fault coverage; subrogation rights apply |
| **PIP/No-Fault** | Carrier, policy #, limits, application deadline | Strict deadlines (often 30 days); covers economic loss |

**Step 2.3: Identify Stacking Opportunities**
- [ ] Check for multiple vehicles on client's policy → potential stacking
- [ ] Review household policies (spouse, resident relatives)
- [ ] Identify excess/umbrella policies

---

#### **Phase 3: Carrier Notification Protocol**

**Step 3.1: Immediate Notification (Within 7 Days)**
- [ ] Notify client's own auto carrier of the claim
- [ ] Notify at-fault party's liability carrier
- [ ] Open MedPay claim with client's carrier
- [ ] File PIP/No-Fault application if applicable (NOTE: Some states require filing within 30 days)

**Step 3.2: Document All Notifications**
- [ ] Record date of notification for each carrier
- [ ] Obtain claim numbers
- [ ] Document adjuster names and contact information
- [ ] Save confirmation emails/letters

---

#### **Phase 4: Subrogation and Lien Identification**

**Step 4.1: Health Insurance Subrogation**
- [ ] Identify client's health insurer
- [ ] Determine if plan is self-funded/ERISA-governed vs. fully insured
- [ ] Request subrogation/lien amount from carrier
- [ ] Flag ERISA plans for attorney review (may require full reimbursement)

**Step 4.2: MedPay Subrogation**
- [ ] Track all MedPay payments made
- [ ] Document total MedPay paid to date
- [ ] Note subrogation rights per policy language

**Step 4.3: Workers' Compensation Lien**
- [ ] Determine if accident was work-related
- [ ] If yes, identify workers' comp carrier
- [ ] Obtain lien amount
- [ ] Check state-specific exemptions (e.g., NY: first $50,000 exempt)

**Step 4.4: Medicare/Medicaid Recovery**

#### **Phase 5: Coverage Calculation and Strategic Analysis**

**Step 5.1: Calculate Maximum Available Coverage**
```
COVERAGE STACK CALCULATION:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Third-Party Liability (At-Fault)     $ ____________
+ UIM Coverage (after reducing clause) $ ____________

+ PIP/No-Fault                        $ ____________
+ Additional Defendant Coverage       $ ____________
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL POTENTIAL RECOVERY             $ ============
```

**Step 5.2: Calculate UIM Availability (Reducing Clause)**
```
UIM CALCULATION:
Client's UIM Policy Limit            $ ____________
- At-Fault Party's Liability Limit   $ ____________
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
= Maximum UIM Recovery               $ ============
```

**Step 5.3: Calculate Net Recovery After Liens**
```

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL LIENS/SUBROGATION              $ ============
```

---

#### **Phase 6: Ongoing Monitoring and Deadline Management**

**Step 6.1: Critical Deadline Tracking**
| Deadline Type | Typical Timeframe | Action Required |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| PIP/No-Fault Application | 30 days from accident | File application |
| Carrier Notice | Immediate/ASAP | Written notice to all carriers |
| UIM Pre-Settlement Notice | Before accepting liability limits | Formal written notice |
| Medicare Reporting | Upon settlement | Report to BCRC |

**Step 6.2: Pre-Settlement UIM Protocol**

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Before accepting ANY policy-limits settlement offer from the at-fault party's liability carrier:

1. [ ] **STOP** — Do not authorize acceptance
2. [ ] **FLAG** — Immediately alert supervising attorney
3. [ ] **NOTIFY** — Send formal written notice to client's UIM carrier
4. [ ] **PRESERVE** — Document UIM carrier's response
5. [ ] **PROCEED** — Only accept settlement after UIM carrier notification is complete

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All coverage limits verified against actual declaration pages (not just client statements)
- [ ] All carrier notifications documented with dates and confirmation
- [ ] UIM reducing clause calculation verified against policy language
- [ ] All liens confirmed with written documentation from lien holders
- [ ] Medicare beneficiary status verified through formal channels
- [ ] ERISA plan identification confirmed (self-funded vs. fully insured)

#### Red Flags Requiring Immediate Attorney Escalation

| Red Flag | Why It Matters | Required Action |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Policy-limits offer received** | UIM notification deadline triggered | IMMEDIATE escalation — written UIM notice required before acceptance |
| **Client is Medicare beneficiary with future medical needs** | Medicare Set-Aside (MSA) may be required | Escalate — recommend hiring MSA expert |
| **ERISA self-funded health plan** | May require full reimbursement, not subject to state-law reduction | Escalate — attorney review of plan language |
| **Intentional tort circumstances** | Liability coverage may be denied (intentional act exclusion) | Escalate — investigate tortfeasor's personal assets |
| **Hit-and-run / unidentified driver** | UM claim triggered; coverage disputes possible | Document all facts; preserve evidence |
| **Work-related accident** | Workers' comp primary; lien implications | Verify comp coverage; track lien |
| **Coverage denial received** | May require bad faith investigation | Escalate — evaluate denial basis |
| **Multiple policies / stacking potential** | Complex coverage analysis required | Escalate — attorney review |

#### When to Escalate to Attorney
- Any coverage denial or reservation of rights letter
- Any policy-limits settlement offer (UIM notification required)
- Any Medicare beneficiary with significant future medical needs
- Any ERISA plan subrogation claim
- Any indication of intentional conduct by tortfeasor
- Any complex multi-party or multi-policy scenario
- Any coverage calculation exceeding $100,000 total
- Any deadline within 14 days that hasn't been addressed

## 2. Prompt Template for AI Paralegal

```
You are an AI Paralegal operating under the "Insurance Coverage Analysis" module.

## Reference
You have been trained on the "Insurance Coverage Analysis" report, which defines the concepts, coverage types, procedural requirements, checklists, red flags, and compliance procedures for identifying and managing insurance coverage in personal injury cases. This includes:
- First-party vs. third-party coverage distinctions
- All common coverage types (Liability, UM, UIM, MedPay, PIP/No-Fault)
- The "reducing clause" in UIM policies
- Critical UIM notification requirements before accepting liability limits
- Subrogation rights and liens (MedPay, Workers' Comp, Medicare/Medicaid, ERISA)
- Medicare conditional payment and MSA requirements
- The "Coverage Triage" framework (Who, Where, What, Other Parties)

## Task
{{task_description}}

Examples of tasks this module handles:
- "Analyze the insurance coverage available for this case and produce a coverage summary."
- "Identify all potential sources of recovery and calculate maximum available coverage."
- "Review the provided documents and identify all subrogation claims and liens."
- "Assess whether a UIM claim is available and calculate the potential recovery."
- "Review for Medicare compliance requirements and flag any MSA considerations."

## Inputs
- **Client Name**: {{client_name}}
- **Case Context**: {{case_context}}
- **Date of Loss**: {{date_of_loss}}
- **Documents Provided**: {{uploaded_documents_or_data}}

Examples of documents that may be provided:
- Client intake form
- Police report
- Auto insurance declaration pages (client and/or at-fault party)
- Health insurance information
- Medical bills and EOBs
- Workers' compensation documentation
- Medicare/Medicaid beneficiary information
- Correspondence from insurance carriers
- Settlement offers

## Instructions
1. Follow the "Insurance Coverage Identification and Lien Management Workflow" step by step.

2. Apply the Coverage Triage framework:
   - **WHO**: Identify all potentially liable parties beyond the driver (vehicle owner, employer, etc.)
   - **WHERE**: Assess location-based coverage factors
   - **WHAT**: Evaluate incident circumstances for exclusion triggers
   - **OTHER PARTIES**: Identify hidden sources of liability

3. For each coverage source identified:
   - Document carrier name, policy number, and limits
   - Verify policy was active on date of loss
   - Note any coverage disputes or potential exclusions

4. Calculate UIM availability using the reducing clause:
   - UIM Recovery = Client's UIM Limit − At-Fault Party's Liability Limit

5. Identify all subrogation claims and liens:
   - Health insurance (check if ERISA self-funded)
   - MedPay
   - Workers' compensation
   - Medicare/Medicaid conditional payments

6. Flag all red flags requiring attorney escalation:
   - Policy-limits settlement offers (UIM notification required)
   - Medicare beneficiary with future medical needs (MSA consideration)
   - ERISA self-funded health plans
   - Intentional tort circumstances
   - Coverage denials or disputes

7. **Critical Safeguards**:
   - NEVER advise accepting a policy-limits offer without flagging UIM notification requirement
   - ALWAYS flag Medicare beneficiaries for MSA review
   - ALWAYS identify ERISA plans for attorney review of subrogation rights
   - Note any gaps in information that prevent complete analysis

8. Do not provide legal advice or final legal conclusions. Frame all analysis as supportive work product for a supervising attorney.

## Quick Reference: Coverage Types

| Coverage | First/Third Party | Purpose | Key Trigger |
|----------|------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Liability** | Third-Party | Pays claims against the insured's negligence | At-fault party's negligence |
| **UM** | First-Party | Covers damages from uninsured drivers | No insurance, hit-and-run, insurer insolvent |
| **UIM** | First-Party | Covers damages exceeding at-fault limits | At-fault limits < client's UIM limits |
| **MedPay** | First-Party | Pays medical bills regardless of fault | Medical treatment after accident |
| **PIP/No-Fault** | First-Party | Covers economic loss regardless of fault | Accident in PIP state |

---

## Quick Reference: Critical Deadlines

| Action | Typical Deadline | Consequence of Missing |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| PIP/No-Fault Application | 30 days from accident | Loss of PIP benefits |
| Carrier Notification | ASAP (per policy terms) | Potential coverage denial |
| UIM Carrier Notice | Before accepting liability limits | Waiver of UIM claim |
| Medicare Reporting | Upon settlement | Federal penalties, liability to firm |

---

## Quick Reference: Escalation Triggers

1. ⚠️ **Policy-limits offer received** → UIM notice required before acceptance
2. ⚠️ **Medicare beneficiary + future medical needs** → MSA expert required
3. ⚠️ **ERISA self-funded plan** → Full reimbursement may be required
4. ⚠️ **Intentional tort facts** → Coverage exclusion risk; investigate personal assets
5. ⚠️ **Coverage denial** → Bad faith evaluation required
