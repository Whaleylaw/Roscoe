### Report 1: Case Intake & Client Screening

**Purpose:**
This report will serve as the AI paralegal's foundational training on systematic client intake—the most critical decision point in plaintiff's personal injury practice. It covers how to gather comprehensive information efficiently, identify conflicts of interest, screen for case viability and client reliability red flags, and avoid inadvertent attorney-client relationships with declined prospects. Poor intake decisions can devastate a firm's resources; this module ensures the AI paralegal knows what to look for and what questions to ask from first contact.

**Intended Use in AI Paralegal OS:**
Used at the very beginning of any new matter—when a potential client contacts the firm. The AI paralegal will reference this module to structure intake interviews, run conflicts checks, identify red flags, and recommend case acceptance or declination. This is the "front gate" of the system.

**Core Topics & Sections:**
- The "Who, What, When, Where, Why, How" framework for intake
- Conflict of interest rules (ABA 1.7, 1.9, 1.10, 1.18) and checking procedures
- Case viability red flags (inconsistent narratives, liability concerns, damages limitations)
- Client reliability red flags (communication issues, unrealistic expectations, credibility)
- Information gathering checklists (client demographics, accident details, insurance, injuries)
- Electronic intake systems, HIPAA compliance, and data security

Case Intake & Client Screening: A Training Framework for the AI Paralegal

1.0 Overview & The Strategic Importance of Intake

For a plaintiff's personal injury firm operating on a contingency fee basis, the initial client intake is the single most critical decision point. This screening process is not a mere administrative task; it is a strategic evaluation that dictates the firm's allocation of time, resources, and capital. Every case accepted represents a significant investment, and the quality of these initial decisions will ultimately determine the firm's success or failure.

The economic stakes of intake are immense. In a contingency practice, the firm fronts all costs and invests hundreds of hours of professional time with no guarantee of recovery. A shrewd and disciplined intake process is the foundation of profitability, identifying viable cases with credible clients that justify the firm's investment. Conversely, poor intake choices—accepting cases with insurmountable liability issues, limited damages, or unreliable clients—can cripple a firm. Each ill-advised case consumes overhead and unrecoverable costs, diverting finite resources from more meritorious claims.

The purpose of this report is to provide a systematic framework for conducting comprehensive, compliant, and strategically sound client intake. This document will equip the AI Paralegal with the foundational knowledge and practical procedures necessary to screen potential clients effectively, ensuring that every case the firm accepts is built on a solid foundation. Before detailing the practical steps of this process, it is essential to first understand the foundational legal and ethical rules that govern every client interaction from the very first contact.

2.0 Key Legal Concepts and Rules

The client intake process is governed by a strict set of ethical rules established by the American Bar Association (ABA) and adopted by state bars. These rules are designed to protect clients, prospective clients, and the integrity of the legal profession. Mastery of these concepts is non-negotiable for compliant operation and for avoiding serious malpractice risks.

2.1 Conflicts of Interest: The ABA Model Rules Framework

Rigorous conflict checking is paramount to avoid ethical violations. The following ABA Model Rules provide the core framework for identifying and managing conflicts of interest during the intake process.

* ABA Model Rule 1.7 (Current Clients)
  * Core Principle: This rule establishes a dual prohibition. An attorney cannot represent a client if their interests are "directly adverse" to another current client. Furthermore, an attorney cannot represent a client if there is a "significant risk" that the representation will be "materially limited" by the attorney's responsibilities to another client, a former client, or a third person.
  * Practical Implications: During intake, every prospective client and adverse party must be screened against all current firm clients. The key analysis is whether the firm's loyalty or independent judgment could be compromised. This "materially limited" standard is exceptionally broad and applies even if the new case is completely unrelated to any existing matter.
* ABA Model Rule 1.9 (Former Clients)
  * Core Principle: This rule prohibits an attorney from representing a new client in the "same or a substantially related matter" where that client's interests are materially adverse to a former client, unless the former client gives informed consent in writing.
  * Practical Implications: The firm must maintain a comprehensive and searchable database of all former clients. During intake, every prospective client and all adverse parties must be checked against this database to ensure the new matter is not the same as or "substantially related" to a past representation.
* ABA Model Rule 1.10 (Imputation of Conflicts)
  * Core Principle: A conflict of interest for one attorney is generally "imputed to the entire firm." This means if one lawyer in the firm is barred from representing a client due to a conflict, every lawyer in the firm is also barred.
  * Practical Implications: This rule is particularly relevant when the firm considers hiring attorneys from other firms, such as "hiring an attorney from the defense side." The new attorney's past conflicts are imputed to the entire firm, although proper screening procedures can sometimes mitigate this issue.
* ABA Model Rule 1.18 (Prospective Clients)
  * Core Principle: An attorney owes duties of confidentiality and conflict avoidance to prospective clients, even if no formal attorney-client relationship is ever formed. The firm is prohibited from using or revealing information learned during a consultation and cannot later represent a client with interests adverse to the prospective client in the same or a substantially related matter.
  * Practical Implications: It is absolutely essential to maintain a detailed log of all prospective clients, including those whose cases are declined. This log is a critical component of the conflicts check system, preventing the firm from inadvertently taking on a case in the future that conflicts with a prior consultation.

2.2 The Duty of Confidentiality

Under ABA Model Rule 1.6, the duty of confidentiality is exceptionally broad. It is not limited to privileged communications between the attorney and the client. Instead, it covers "any information obtained during the representation," regardless of the source. This duty applies from the moment a prospective client begins sharing information and continues even after the representation has concluded.

2.3 Avoiding Inadvertent Attorney-Client Relationships

A significant risk during intake is inadvertently establishing an attorney-client relationship with a prospective client whose case the firm ultimately declines. If the person reasonably believes a relationship was formed, they could later file a malpractice claim against the firm—for instance, for a missed statute of limitations—even if the firm never intended to represent them. The following methods are critical for avoiding this risk.

* Use Clear Disclaimers and Non-Engagement Letters: When declining a case, the communication must be "courteous and professional, but clear." The best practice is to always follow up with a "written non-engagement letter" that explicitly states the firm will not be representing the individual and is not taking any action on their behalf.
* Avoid Giving Specific Legal Advice: It is critical to refrain from providing specific legal advice to a person whose case is being rejected. This can be a fine line, but it is a crucial one.
  * Prohibited Statement: "Your statute of limitations is X date." This is specific legal advice that can create a dangerous reliance.
  * Acceptable Statement: "...There is a statute of limitations that's applicable to your case. Time is of the essence. You need to hire another attorney as soon as possible." This softened language provides a necessary warning without creating an attorney-client relationship.

With these foundational ethical rules as a guide, the AI can now proceed to the practical, step-by-step procedures for conducting an effective and compliant client intake.

3.0 Practical Checklists and Procedures

A systematic, checklist-driven process is essential for managing cognitive load, preventing critical errors, and ensuring consistency in information gathering across all potential cases. This structured approach frees up mental energy to focus on the nuanced aspects of case evaluation.

3.1 The Six-Question Information Gathering Framework

The "who, what, when, where, why, how" framework provides a core structure for gathering the comprehensive initial information needed to evaluate a potential case and run a proper conflicts check.

* Who:
  * Identify all potential clients (e.g., driver, passengers), adverse parties (e.g., other drivers, vehicle owners, employers), and any known witnesses.
  * Assess for potential derivative claims, such as a "loss of consortium claim" by a spouse, which must be considered from the outset.
* What:
  * Obtain a brief but accurate description of the incident.
  * It is critical to capture this description in the "caller's words" to avoid paraphrasing or misinterpretation. This preserves the raw details of their recollection.
* When and Where:
  * These facts are crucial for determining the applicable "statute limitations" and the proper venue for filing a lawsuit.
  * Specificity is key. A vague location like "Dallas is a big city" is insufficient and requires immediate follow-up for a precise address or intersection.
* Why:
  * This question is framed to understand the client's goals and expectations: "Why are you hiring me?"
  * This helps screen for clients with unrealistic expectations, such as those who believe they are entitled to "a million dollars 'cause they saw it on a commercial."
* How:
  * Ascertain how the prospective client heard about the firm. This information is valuable for tracking the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
  * Determine their payment expectations to ensure they understand the contingency fee arrangement.

3.2 Conflicts Checking Protocols

A rigorous and consistent conflicts check is a non-negotiable step in the intake process. The following protocols represent the modern best practice.

1. Utilize a Digital, Searchable Database: A modern law practice must use a digital system for conflicts checking. "Case management software is best," but an "Excel spreadsheet at a minimum" is required. Relying on "solely paper records are likely on the way toward being unethical" due to their inefficiency and unreliability.
2. Document All Prospective and Rejected Clients: The database must include every individual who consults with the firm, even those whose cases are not accepted. This is essential for checking against future conflicts under ABA Model Rule 1.18.
3. Centralize the Intake Process: Limiting the number of individuals who handle initial intake allows them to build expertise. A centralized team is more likely to spot patterns, recognize recurring names, and identify potential conflicts that a more diffuse process might miss.
4. Conduct Thorough Name Searches: It is not enough to search for a single name. Always get the potential client's "legal name and preferred name and search for both" to ensure all potential connections and conflicts are identified.

3.3 Technology and Client Experience

Modern intake requires leveraging technology to ensure efficiency, security, and a positive client experience.

* Electronic Systems: Utilize "secure form platforms" like Dropbox Business or Filevine for electronic intake forms. These systems streamline data collection and integrate with case management software.
* Data Security and Privacy: When handling protected health information, systems must be HIPAA compliant. Use "secure e-mail systems" like Office 365 Business. Never use personal accounts like Gmail or Hotmail for client communications.
* Vendor Agreements: The firm must have a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) in place with any third-party vendor that handles electronic protected health information (ePHI). Services like Microsoft 365 Business and Dropbox Business offer BAAs, while their personal versions do not.
* Client Usability: The intake process should be as seamless as possible for the client. The "Don't be a doctor" analogy warns against making clients repeat the same information multiple times on different forms after they have already provided it verbally. This creates a frustrating experience and a poor first impression.

Applying these procedures will enable the systematic capture of the specific facts needed to properly evaluate a potential case.

4.0 Critical Data Points the AI Paralegal Must Capture

This section itemizes the non-negotiable data fields required for a complete and actionable intake record. This information forms the basis for the conflicts check, the initial case evaluation, and all subsequent strategic decisions.

4.1 Client Demographics

* Full legal name, preferred name, and all aliases
* Date of birth and Social Security Number
* Current address, contact phone numbers, and email address
* Marital status and spouse's information
* Employment information (employer, position, supervisor)

4.2 Accident and Liability Details

* Date, time, and precise location of the incident
* Detailed client narrative of the event
* Weather and road conditions at the time of the incident
* Police involvement, responding agency, and report number
* Any citations issued to any party involved
* Names and contact information for all known witnesses

4.3 Insurance Information

* Client's auto insurance carrier, policy number, and a copy of the declaration page
* Client's health insurance carrier, including Medicare/Medicaid status
* Adverse driver's insurance company and policy number (if known)
* Vehicle owner's information and insurance if different from the driver

4.4 Medical Information

* All body parts injured and immediate symptoms experienced
* Emergency medical treatment received (e.g., ambulance transport, ER visit)
* Names of all current treating physicians and facilities
* Any pre-existing medical conditions, especially those affecting the same body parts as the new injuries

4.5 Initial Damages Assessment

* Documentation of lost wages and time missed from work
* Status of property damage to the client's vehicle
* Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred (e.g., transportation, prescriptions)

While gathering comprehensive data is a crucial mechanical task, the real analytical work begins with interpreting that data to identify warning signs of a potentially problematic case.

5.0 Red Flags and Escalation Triggers

A primary function of the intake process is to act as a strategic filter, identifying "red flags" that signal potential problems with a case or a client. This screening is vital to protect the firm from investing significant time and resources into cases that are unwinnable, unprofitable, or unmanageable.

5.1 Case Viability Red Flags

These red flags suggest fundamental weaknesses in the merits of the case itself.

* Inconsistent Narratives: The potential client's story conflicts with objective evidence like a police report, photographs of the scene, or statements from independent witnesses.
* Credibility Issues: The client is caught in a deliberate lie during the intake process. This is described as the "brightest of red flags" and an immediate indication that "there is no way you should be considering this case."
* "Killer Defenses": The initial facts suggest the presence of a strong legal or factual defense that could bar recovery, such as a clearly missed statute of limitations or significant comparative fault on the part of the client.
* Pre-existing Conditions: The client has a significant pre-existing medical history involving the same body parts injured in the accident. This will complicate the ability to prove that the accident caused the current medical problems.
* "Bad Jury Optic": The case involves suing a highly sympathetic defendant, such as a well-regarded local charity, which could make a jury reluctant to award damages.

5.2 Client Reliability and Management Red Flags

These red flags suggest that the client may be difficult to work with, which can jeopardize the case regardless of its merits.

* Poor Cooperation: The client is uncooperative, unresponsive, or difficult to reach during the intake process itself. This is a powerful predictor of future behavior. As one expert noted, "If they won't cooperate at intake, will they really show up for deposition? My instinct is no."
* Unrealistic Expectations: The client expresses a firm belief that their case is worth an astronomical amount based on television commercials or anecdotes from friends, and they are not receptive to a more realistic valuation.
* Difficult Personality: The initial interactions indicate the client will be consistently critical, demanding, or unpleasant, which is likely to create a "terrible time" for the entire legal team. At intake, potential clients "are as good as they will ever be," and if that behavior is already poor, it will not improve.

5.3 Escalation Protocol

The identification of any significant red flag requires immediate escalation for review by a supervising attorney before any further action is taken or a representation agreement is offered.

6.0 Example Application

This section provides a brief, practical example of red flag identification during the intake process.

* Scenario: A prospective client calls the firm stating they were "rear-ended" and that the accident was clearly the other driver's fault.
* Intake Process: The intake specialist follows protocol and obtains the official police report and photographs of both vehicles involved in the collision.
* Red Flag Identified: The evidence reveals a critical inconsistency. While the client's vehicle was indeed struck from behind, the primary point of impact was to the side of the other vehicle. This strongly suggests that the client may have cut the other driver off immediately before the impact. This is a Case Viability Red Flag because the client's storyline does not align with the physical evidence, creating significant liability and credibility problems.
* Action: The intake specialist must immediately escalate the file to the supervising attorney for a final decision on whether to decline the case.

The source materials provide numerous principles and examples for conducting a thorough intake but do not contain extensive, fully developed case study scenarios beyond illustrative examples such as this.
