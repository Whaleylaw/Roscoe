# Case Intake & Client Screening: AI Paralegal Operational Module

---

## 1. Operational Workflow

### Workflow Name
**Case Intake & Client Screening Workflow**

### Goal
Successful completion means:
- All required client and incident information has been systematically captured
- A comprehensive conflicts check has been performed against all current, former, and prospective clients
- Case viability and client reliability red flags have been identified and documented
- A clear recommendation (accept, decline, or escalate) has been prepared for the supervising attorney
- If declining, proper non-engagement procedures have been followed to avoid inadvertent attorney-client relationships

### When to Use
Trigger this workflow when:
- A new potential client contacts the firm seeking representation
- An existing client refers a new individual for a consultation
- A prospective client is transferred from another intake channel (web form, marketing lead, etc.)
- The firm is asked to evaluate a case from an external referral source
- Any person begins sharing case-related information with the firm

### Inputs Required
1. **Initial Contact Information**: Name, phone number, email (if available)
2. **Referral Source**: How the prospective client found the firm
3. **Preliminary Incident Description**: Basic facts shared during initial contact
4. **Access to Conflicts Database**: Current clients, former clients, prospective/declined clients
5. **Relevant Documents** (if provided): Police reports, medical records, photos, insurance information

## Quick Reference: Key Rules from Training Report

### ABA Rules Summary
| Rule | Scope | Key Point |
|------|-------|-----------|
| 1.7 | Current Clients | Cannot represent if directly adverse OR if materially limited |
| 1.9 | Former Clients | Cannot represent in same/substantially related matter if adverse |
| 1.10 | Imputation | One attorney's conflict = entire firm's conflict |
| 1.18 | Prospective Clients | Owe confidentiality even if never retained |
| 1.6 | Confidentiality | Covers ALL information obtained, any source, indefinitely |

### Non-Engagement Letter Key Phrases
**PROHIBITED**: "Your statute of limitations is [specific date]."  
**ACCEPTABLE**: "There is a statute of limitations applicable to your case. Time is of the essence. You need to consult another attorney as soon as possible."

### Core Principle
> "If they won't cooperate at intake, will they really show up for deposition? My instinct is no."

> "At intake, potential clients are as good as they will ever be."
