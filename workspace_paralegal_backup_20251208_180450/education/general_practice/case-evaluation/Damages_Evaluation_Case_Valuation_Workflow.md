### Step-by-Step Process

#### **Phase 1: Economic Damages Documentation**

**Step 1.1 — Medical Expenses Compilation**
- [ ] Gather all medical bills chronologically
- [ ] Verify billing amounts against EOBs and payment records
- [ ] Distinguish between:
  - **Incurred expenses** (treatment to date)
  - **Future medical expenses** (anticipated treatment)
- [ ] Document which bills are:
  - Paid by health insurance
  - Paid out-of-pocket by client
  - Outstanding/unpaid
- [ ] Calculate total medical specials (past + future)

**Step 1.2 — Lost Wages Analysis**
- [ ] Document pre-injury employment status and earnings
- [ ] Calculate **past lost wages**:
  - Days/hours missed from work × hourly/daily rate
  - Include lost bonuses, commissions, overtime opportunities
  - Account for PTO/sick time used
- [ ] Assess **future lost earning capacity** (if applicable):
  - Vocational limitations from injuries
  - Career trajectory impact
  - Need for vocational expert if significant
- [ ] Gather supporting documentation:
  - Employer verification letter
  - Pay stubs covering pre/post injury periods
  - Tax returns (2-3 years)

**Step 1.3 — Future Care Costs**

- [ ] Identify anticipated future expenses:
  - Ongoing therapy (physical, occupational, psychological)
  - Future surgeries or procedures
  - Prescription medications (ongoing)
  - Medical equipment/assistive devices
  - Home modifications
- [ ] Flag if **Life Care Plan** from expert is needed for significant future care claims

**Step 1.4 — Household Services Valuation**
- [ ] Document client's pre-injury household responsibilities
- [ ] Identify activities client can no longer perform or performs with difficulty:
  - Yard work, home maintenance
  - Cleaning, laundry
  - Childcare assistance
  - Cooking, errands
- [ ] Apply **replacement cost method**:
  - Research local rates for equivalent services
  - Calculate hours per week × rate × duration of impairment
  - Document methodology and rate sources

---

#### **Phase 2: Non-Economic Damages Documentation**

**Step 2.1 — Pain and Suffering Quantification**
- [ ] Document nature and severity of pain:
  - Pain levels reported in medical records (0-10 scale)
  - Duration (acute vs. chronic)
  - Impact on sleep, mood, relationships
- [ ] Apply quantification methods:
  - **Per diem method**: Daily rate × number of affected days
  - **Multiplier method**: Medical specials × factor (2-5x typically)
  - Document which method is being used and why

**Step 2.2 — Emotional Distress Documentation**
- [ ] Identify psychological/emotional impacts:
  - Anxiety, depression, PTSD symptoms
  - Fear of driving/similar activities
  - Relationship strain
- [ ] Gather supporting evidence:
  - Mental health treatment records
  - Prescription records (antidepressants, anxiolytics)

  - Intimacy

---

#### **Phase 3: Multiplying & Diminishing Factors Assessment**

**Step 3.1 — Defendant Conduct Multipliers**
Identify and document any aggravating factors that increase case value:

| Factor | Evidence Required | Multiplier Effect |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DUI/Drunk driving | BAC results, arrest records | Significant ↑ |
| Distracted driving (phone) | Phone records, witness statements | Moderate ↑ |
| Commercial vehicle/trucking | Driver logs, FMCSA violations | Moderate to Significant ↑ |
| Reckless/egregious conduct | Police report, citations | Moderate ↑ |
| Prior similar conduct | Driving history | Moderate ↑ |
| Defendant fled scene | Police report | Significant ↑ |
| Corporate defendant misconduct | Internal documents, policies | Significant ↑ |

**Step 3.2 — Plaintiff Conduct Diminishing Factors**
Identify and document any factors that may reduce case value:

| Factor | Evidence | Diminishing Effect |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| Seatbelt non-use | Police report, medical records | Moderate ↓ (varies by jurisdiction) |

- [ ] Distinguish between:
  - **Aggravation**: Pre-existing condition made worse by accident
  - **Independent injury**: New injury to previously affected area
  - **Acceleration**: Condition that would have developed eventually, but accelerated
- [ ] Apply "eggshell plaintiff" rule where applicable (defendant takes plaintiff as they find them)
- [ ] Document medical opinions on causation

**Step 4.3 — Apportionment Considerations**

- [ ] Identify **made whole doctrine** applicability
- [ ] Document basis for reduction negotiations
- [ ] Flag liens requiring specialized handling (Medicare, ERISA)

---

#### **Phase 6: Valuation Calculation**

**Step 6.1 — Gross Settlement Value Range**
Calculate preliminary value range:

```
ECONOMIC DAMAGES:
  Past medical expenses:         $__________
  Future medical expenses:       $__________
  Past lost wages:               $__________
  Future lost earning capacity:  $__________
  Household services:            $__________
  Other economic:                $__________
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL ECONOMIC:                $__________

NON-ECONOMIC DAMAGES:
  Pain and suffering:            $__________
  Emotional distress:            $__________
  Loss of enjoyment:             $__________
  Loss of consortium:            $__________
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL NON-ECONOMIC:            $__________

GROSS VALUE RANGE:               $__________ to $__________
```

**Step 6.2 — Apply Multipliers/Diminishers**
- [ ] Apply defendant conduct multipliers (document basis)
- [ ] Apply plaintiff diminishing factors (document basis)
- [ ] Note venue/jurisdiction factors
- [ ] Adjust value range accordingly

**Step 6.3 — Net Settlement Calculation**

```
Gross Settlement:                $__________
Less:
  Attorney fees (____%):        -$__________
  Costs:                        -$__________
  Health insurance lien:        -$__________
  Medicare lien:                -$__________
  Other liens:                  -$__________
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
NET TO CLIENT:                   $__________
```

---

#### **Phase 7: Settlement Structure Options**

**Step 7.1 — Lump Sum vs. Structured Settlement Analysis**
Assess whether structured settlement may benefit client:
- [ ] Large settlement amount (typically $100k+)
- [ ] Minor plaintiff (funds until adulthood)
- [ ] Client with financial management concerns
- [ ] Need for guaranteed future income stream
- [ ] Medicare Set-Aside requirements

**Step 7.2 — Medical Bill Waiver Tactic**
For appropriate cases, assess "medical bill waiver" approach:
- [ ] Identify providers who may accept reduced payment at settlement
- [ ] Document relationships with treating providers
- [ ] Calculate potential savings from provider reductions
- [ ] **Note:** This is an advanced tactic requiring attorney approval

---

#### **Phase 8: Client Expectation Management**

**Step 8.1 — Realistic Value Communication**
Prepare materials to help attorney discuss case value with client:
- [ ] Document value range with supporting rationale
- [ ] Identify factors that could increase or decrease value
- [ ] Prepare comparison data if available (similar cases, verdict research)
- [ ] List uncertainties and risks

**Step 8.2 — Net vs. Gross Distinction**
Ensure client understands:
- [ ] Difference between gross settlement and net to client
- [ ] Impact of liens on recovery
- [ ] Attorney fee calculation
- [ ] Timing of payments (especially with structured settlements)

---

### Quality Checks & Safeguards

#### Validation Checks
- [ ] All medical bills accounted for and reconciled with treatment records
- [ ] Lost wage calculations verified against documentation
- [ ] All liens identified and amounts confirmed in writing
- [ ] Valuation methodology documented and defensible
- [ ] Before/after evidence gathered and catalogued
- [ ] Pre-existing conditions fully documented with causation analysis

#### Red Flags — Escalate to Attorney
| Red Flag | Escalation Reason |
|----------|-------------------|
| Medicare beneficiary with significant medical bills | MSA may be required |
| ERISA health plan with aggressive subrogation | Federal preemption issues |
| Workers' comp lien with disputed apportionment | Complex interaction |
| Client expectations grossly exceed realistic range | Expectation management needed |
| Significant comparative fault exposure | Strategy discussion needed |
| Pre-existing condition with unclear causation | Medical expert may be needed |
| Policy limits potentially inadequate | Bad faith/excess carrier issues |
| Client receiving disability benefits | Offset issues |
| Structured settlement appropriate | Financial advisor involvement |
| Evidence of prior fraudulent claims | Credibility crisis |

#### Never Do
- ❌ Provide the client with a specific "guaranteed" case value
- ❌ Promise specific lien reduction amounts
- ❌ Make representations about what the case "will" settle for
- ❌ Advise client whether to accept or reject settlement offer
- ❌ Contact lienholders to negotiate without attorney authorization
- ❌ Omit known diminishing factors from analysis
