### Quiz Answer Key

* Cognitive Load & Checklists: Checklists help manage cognitive load by externalizing information that would otherwise overload working memory. They provide a structured guide, ensuring important steps aren't forgotten and reducing the mental strain of recalling every detail for multiple tasks or cases.  
* Do-Confirm vs. Read-Do: Do-Confirm checklists involve performing tasks from memory and then stopping to confirm completion, useful for seasoned professionals. For example, a senior paralegal might confirm all post-filing documents were sent. Read-Do checklists involve performing each step as it's read, ideal for new attorneys learning processes, like a "baby lawyer" navigating pre-suit discovery.  
* Checklist Fatigue: Checklist fatigue occurs when too many checklists or overly complex ones lead to a psychological disengagement, causing users to merely "check off" items without meaningful engagement. It can be avoided by making checklists concise, outcome-driven, and targeting only specific, meaningful areas, preventing them from becoming burdensome.  
* Client Intake "Red Flag": A significant red flag at intake is when a potential client's storyline does not align with available evidence, such as photographic proof or police reports contradicting their narrative of an accident. Another red flag is a client who is non-responsive or unreliable during the intake process, failing to sign contracts or return calls, which suggests potential non-cooperation for future litigation.  
* Rule 1.10 (Imputation of Conflicts): ABA Model Rule 1.10 dictates that a conflict of interest for one attorney is generally imputed to the entire firm, meaning no one else in the firm can take on the representation. This rule ensures that a firm cannot circumvent conflict rules by simply assigning a case to a non-conflicted attorney within the same firm.  
* Pleading "Special Damages": According to Rick Gikas, "special damages" are those that arise from unusual circumstances and don't necessarily result directly from the wrongful act, thus not being implied by law. To recover them, these damages, like the loss of a particular job due to injury, must be specifically alleged and proven in the pleading.  
* Motion for Default Caution: An attorney should be cautious about immediately seeking a motion for default because obtaining a default judgment can inadvertently remove or compromise potential insurance coverage for the defendant. This could leave the plaintiff with an uncollectible judgment, as most defendants lack significant personal assets to cover large verdicts.  
* Motion to Amend Timing: The ideal time to file a motion to amend a pleading is as early in the process as possible, ideally before a responsive pleading is served or discovery closes. Early filing is preferred because courts are generally more liberal in granting amendments in the early stages, minimizing prejudice to the opposing party and avoiding delays or reopening discovery later on.  
* Deposition Breaks: During breaks in a deposition, attorneys and deponents must remember that the deponent is still under oath. While it's acceptable to discuss comfort or general well-being, discussions about the substance of testimony or upcoming questions are typically fair game for questioning by opposing counsel when the deposition resumes.  
* Jury Selection "Overshare": James Weston advises jurors to "overshare" information during voir dire to encourage complete disclosure of any relevant experiences, opinions, or biases. This helps avoid a situation where a juror's undisclosed background later causes issues during trial, potentially leading to complications like a mistrial, as they may know a witness or have undisclosed relevant experiences.

### Essay Format Questions

* Analyze the multifaceted benefits of incorporating checklists into legal practice, drawing on psychological principles (cognitive load, confirmation bias, decision fatigue) and practical applications (efficiency, error prevention, stress reduction). Discuss how these benefits translate across different areas of legal work, from general firm management to specific litigation tasks.  
* Compare and contrast the approaches to client intake and conflicts checking presented by Kim Jones Penepacker and the broader ethical considerations from the ABA Model Rules. Discuss the critical steps necessary to establish an effective, compliant, and client-friendly intake process, highlighting how technology and careful communication mitigate legal landmines.  
* Discuss the strategic implications of pleading in personal injury cases from both the plaintiff's and defendant's perspectives, as presented by Rick Gikas. Analyze how specific pleading rules (e.g., Rule 8 on claims and defenses, Rule 13 on counterclaims, Rule 14 on third-party practice) can be leveraged or pose challenges in litigation, including the concept of "claim preclusion."  
* Examine the various types of motions discussed by James Weston (default, amend, compel, summary judgment, in limine) as strategic tools in personal injury litigation. For each motion, discuss its purpose, key procedural considerations, and the strategic advantages or disadvantages of its use, illustrating how these motions shape the course of a case.  
* Based on the insights from Mark Favaloro and James Weston, critically evaluate the preparation and execution of key trial components: depositions, voir dire, and opening statements. Discuss how thorough pre-trial preparation, strategic decision-making, and effective communication contribute to controlling the narrative, managing expectations, and ultimately influencing the outcome of a personal injury trial.
