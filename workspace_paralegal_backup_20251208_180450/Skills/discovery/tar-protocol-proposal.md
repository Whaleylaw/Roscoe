## Skill Metadata

- **ID**: tar-protocol-proposal
- **Category**: discovery
- **Reference Material**: education/discovery/
- **Tools Required**: read_file, write_file

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Large document productions expected
- E-discovery involved
- Need to propose or respond to TAR protocol
- Cost-effective document review needed

---

## TAR Overview

### What is TAR?
Technology-Assisted Review (TAR), also called:
- Predictive coding
- Computer-assisted review
- Machine learning review

Uses algorithms to identify relevant documents based on human training.

### Benefits
- Cost reduction (70-90%)
- Faster review
- More consistent results
- Defensible process

---

## Protocol Components

### 1. Scope Agreement
- Data sources to search
- Date range
- Custodians
- File types

### 2. Search Methodology
- Keyword searches (initial culling)
- TAR workflow
- Training process
- Validation approach

### 3. Quality Control
- Sampling methodology
- Precision/recall targets
- Elusion testing
- Documentation requirements

### 4. Transparency
- Sharing of seed sets (if agreed)
- Disclosure of methodology
- Access to validation results

---

## Sample Protocol Language

### TAR Workflow
```
1. Initial Data Collection
   - Collect from agreed custodians
   - Apply date filters
   - De-duplicate
   
2. Keyword Culling (Optional)
   - Apply agreed keyword searches
   - Reduce to manageable population
   
3. TAR Training
   - Create seed set from random sample
   - Human review of seed set
   - Train TAR model
   - Iterate until stable
   
4. Validation
   - Statistical sampling
   - Calculate recall rate
   - Document results
   
5. Production
   - Review TAR-identified documents
   - Privilege review
   - Produce responsive documents
```

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Recall | % of relevant docs found | 70-80%+ |
| Precision | % of produced docs actually relevant | 50%+ |
| Elusion | % of discarded docs that were relevant | <10% |
