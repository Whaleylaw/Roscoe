# Supplemental Statement Calculation Guide

## Overview

This reference provides step-by-step guidance for calculating supplemental settlement statements when distributing remaining trust funds after lien resolution.

---

## Standard Calculation Formula

```
Additional Distribution = Holdback Amount - Actual Lien Payments
```

---

## Step-by-Step Calculation

### Step 1: Identify Original Holdback

From original settlement statement:
- Find "Held for Liens" or similar line
- This is the amount placed in trust
- Document the breakdown if multiple liens

**Example:**
```
Original Holdback:
  Medicare (estimated):      $15,000
  ERISA Plan:                 $8,500
  Total Held:                $23,500
```

### Step 2: Document Actual Payments

For each lien paid:
- Final demand or negotiated amount
- Date paid
- Check number or wire reference

**Example:**
```
Actual Payments:
  Medicare (after reduction): $10,000  [Paid 03/15/2025]
  ERISA (negotiated):          $5,500  [Paid 03/20/2025]
  Total Paid:                 $15,500
```

### Step 3: Calculate Remaining

```
Holdback:        $23,500
Less Paid:      -$15,500
───────────────────────
Remaining:        $8,000
```

### Step 4: Verify No Outstanding

Confirm:
- [ ] All liens marked "paid" or "resolved"
- [ ] No pending final demands
- [ ] No disputes outstanding

### Step 5: Calculate Total Net

```
Initial Net to Client:  $45,000
Additional:             + $8,000
─────────────────────────────────
Total Net to Client:    $53,000
```

## Complex Scenarios

### Scenario A: Multiple Lien Reductions

When multiple liens were reduced:

```
Original Holdback:
  Medicare:       $15,000
  ERISA Plan A:    $8,500
  ERISA Plan B:    $3,200
  Hospital:        $5,000
  Total:          $31,700

Actual Payments:
  Medicare:       $10,000 (proc cost reduction)
  ERISA Plan A:    $5,500 (negotiated 35% off)
  ERISA Plan B:    $2,000 (negotiated 37% off)
  Hospital:        $3,500 (negotiated 30% off)
  Total:          $21,000

Additional to Client: $31,700 - $21,000 = $10,700
```

### Scenario B: Lien Fully Waived

When a lien is completely waived:

```
Original Holdback:
  Medicare:       $12,000
  Medicaid:        $6,500
  Total:          $18,500

Actual Payments:
  Medicare:       $8,000 (compromise approved)
  Medicaid:           $0 (hardship waiver)
  Total:           $8,000

Additional to Client: $18,500 - $8,000 = $10,500
```

### Scenario C: Lien Higher Than Expected

Rare scenario where final exceeds estimate:

```
Original Holdback:  $10,000
Actual Payment:     $11,500

Resolution:
- Attorney pays difference from fee (if agreed)
- OR client covers difference from initial distribution
- Document adjustment in statement
```
