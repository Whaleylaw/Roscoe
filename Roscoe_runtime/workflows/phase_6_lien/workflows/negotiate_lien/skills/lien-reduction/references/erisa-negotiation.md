# ERISA Plan Negotiation Reference

## Overview

ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) plans are governed by federal law, which generally preempts state anti-subrogation laws. However, several doctrines and plan language provisions can support reduction arguments.

---

## Key Legal Framework

### ERISA Preemption

- Federal ERISA preempts state law
- Plan language typically controls
- BUT equitable defenses may apply

### Relevant Supreme Court Cases

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| *US Airways v. McCutchen* (2013) | Plan language controls; equitable principles apply if plan silent |
| *Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic* (2006) | ERISA plans can seek equitable lien on settlement |
| *Great-West v. Knudson* (2002) | Limits on ERISA remedies |

## Negotiation Arguments

### 1. Common Fund Doctrine

**Argument:** The plan benefited from the legal work that produced the recovery. It should share in the costs of obtaining that recovery.

**Application:**
- If plan doesn't address attorney fees
- Argue for proportional reduction
- Typical reduction: 25-40%

**Language to Use:**
> "The Plan's recovery was made possible only through our legal efforts. Under the common fund doctrine, the Plan should bear its proportionate share of the attorney fees and costs incurred to produce this recovery."

### 2. Made Whole Doctrine

**Argument:** The beneficiary has not been fully compensated for their injuries and therefore the Plan should not recover until the beneficiary is "made whole."

**When Available:**
- Plan language is silent on "make whole"
- Settlement is less than damages
- Document total damages vs. recovery

**Limitations:**
- *McCutchen* limits this if plan has contrary language
- Check plan documents carefully

### 3. Unjust Enrichment

**Argument:** Allowing full recovery would unjustly enrich the Plan at the expense of its own beneficiary.

**Application:**
- When net to client is minimal
- When Plan paid fraction of medical expenses
- When Plan took no action to pursue recovery

### 4. Plan Language Provisions

**What to Look For:**
- Reduction provisions
- Common fund language
- Discretionary authority
- "Reasonable" recovery language

## Plan Document Analysis

### Step 1: Obtain Documents

Request:
- Summary Plan Description (SPD)
- Full Plan Document
- Subrogation/Reimbursement provisions
- Any amendments

### Step 2: Review Key Sections

Look for:
- Definition of "recovery"
- Subrogation language
- Reimbursement provisions
- Attorney fee provisions
- Reduction clauses

### Step 3: Identify Favorable Language

**Favorable:**
- "Reasonable" language
- Discretionary reduction
- Common fund provisions
- "Make whole" requirements

**Unfavorable:**
- "First dollar" recovery
- No reduction provisions
- Explicit override of equitable doctrines
