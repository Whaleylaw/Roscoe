## Standard PI Instructions

### Burden of Proof

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: BURDEN OF PROOF

The Plaintiff has the burden of proving each element of the 
claim by a preponderance of the evidence.

"Preponderance of the evidence" means that you must be 
persuaded that a proposition is more probably true than not 
true. You should consider all the evidence bearing on every 
issue regardless of who produced it.
```

### Negligence

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: NEGLIGENCE DEFINED

Negligence is the failure to exercise ordinary care. Ordinary 
care is that degree of care which a reasonably careful person 
would use under similar circumstances. Negligence may consist 
either in doing something that a reasonably careful person 
would not do under similar circumstances, or in failing to do 
something that a reasonably careful person would do under 
similar circumstances.
```

### Proximate Cause

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: PROXIMATE CAUSE

A proximate cause is a cause which, in a natural and 
continuous sequence, produces the injury and without which 
the injury would not have occurred.

There may be more than one proximate cause of an injury. 
The negligence of the Defendant need not be the sole cause 
of the injury. It is sufficient if it is a proximate cause.
```

### Comparative Fault (Kentucky)

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: COMPARATIVE FAULT

If you find that both the Plaintiff and the Defendant were 
negligent, and that the negligence of each was a proximate 
cause of the injuries, you shall apportion fault between them.

You shall reduce the Plaintiff's total damages by the 
percentage of fault you attribute to the Plaintiff.
```

### Damages

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: DAMAGES

If you find for the Plaintiff, you shall award damages for:

(a) The reasonable value of medical expenses incurred as a 
    result of the injury;
    
(b) Lost wages and impairment of earning capacity;

(c) Physical pain and suffering, past and future;

(d) Mental anguish, past and future;

(e) Permanent impairment and disfigurement;

(f) Loss of enjoyment of life.

There is no fixed standard for measuring these damages. You 
shall use your sound judgment and award a sum that will fairly 
and reasonably compensate the Plaintiff.
```

## Special Instructions

### Future Damages

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: FUTURE DAMAGES

In determining future damages, you may consider only those 
damages that are reasonably certain to occur. You should not 
speculate about damages that may or may not occur.

Future damages should be reduced to their present cash value.
```

### Aggravation of Pre-Existing Condition

```
INSTRUCTION NO. [X]: PRE-EXISTING CONDITION

If you find that the Plaintiff had a pre-existing condition 
that was aggravated by the accident, the Defendant is liable 
for the full extent of the aggravation, even if the Plaintiff 
was more susceptible to injury than a normal person.

The Defendant is not liable for damages caused solely by the 
pre-existing condition itself.
