## Motion Structure

### I. Caption and Introduction

```
IN THE [COUNTY] CIRCUIT COURT
COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY

[PLAINTIFF NAME],
        Plaintiff,

v.                                          CIVIL ACTION NO. [NUMBER]
                                           DIVISION [X]
[DEFENDANT NAME],
        Defendant.

PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL DISCOVERY AND FOR SANCTIONS

Comes the Plaintiff, [Name], by counsel, and moves this Court pursuant to 
CR 37.01 to compel Defendant to provide complete responses to Plaintiff's 
discovery requests and to award Plaintiff reasonable expenses, including 
attorney fees, incurred in bringing this motion. In support, Plaintiff states:
```

### II. Certification of Meet and Confer Efforts

```
CERTIFICATION

Undersigned counsel certifies that counsel has in good faith conferred 
with counsel for Defendant in an effort to obtain the discovery sought 
without court action. [Detail efforts - letter, phone call, etc.]

Despite these efforts, the parties have been unable to resolve their 
dispute regarding the following discovery requests: [list specific requests].
```

### III. Factual Background

Brief procedural history:
- Date complaint filed
- Date discovery served
- Date responses received
- Meet and confer timeline
- Current status

### IV. Argument

#### A. Legal Standard

```
Under CR 37.01, when a party fails to answer interrogatories or respond 
to requests for production, the propounding party may move for an order 
compelling disclosure. The scope of discovery under CR 26.02(1) is broad, 
encompassing any matter "relevant to the subject matter involved in the 
pending action."

Evasive or incomplete responses are treated as failures to respond. 
CR 37.01(c). When the motion is granted, "the court shall, after opportunity 
for hearing, require the party or deponent whose conduct necessitated the 
motion... to pay to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in 
making the motion, including attorney's fees." CR 37.01(d).
```

#### B. Specific Deficiencies

For each deficient response:

```
1. INTERROGATORY NO. [X]

Plaintiff's Request: [Quote request]

Defendant's Response: [Quote response]

Why Deficient: [Explain deficiency]
   - Response is evasive because [reason]
   - Response fails to provide [what is missing]
   - Response improperly objects because [reason]

What Is Required: [Describe adequate response]
```

#### C. Defendant's Objections Are Invalid

Address specific objections:

```
Defendant's objection based on [ground] is invalid because:
   - [Legal argument]
   - [Case citation if available]
   - [Why objection does not apply here]
```

#### D. Sanctions Are Warranted

```
CR 37.01(d) mandates that the Court award reasonable expenses, including 
attorney fees, when a motion to compel is granted. Here, Plaintiff was 
forced to bring this motion due to Defendant's failure to provide adequate 
discovery responses despite Plaintiff's good faith efforts to resolve the 
dispute informally.

Plaintiff has incurred the following expenses in bringing this motion:
   - Attorney time: [X] hours at $[rate]/hour = $[amount]
   - Research and preparation: [X] hours = $[amount]
   - Total: $[amount]
```

### V. Conclusion

```
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

1. GRANT this Motion to Compel;

2. ORDER Defendant to provide complete responses to Interrogatory Nos. 
   [list] and Request for Production Nos. [list] within [X] days;

3. AWARD Plaintiff reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, in the 
   amount of $[X] incurred in bringing this motion;

4. GRANT such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,

[Attorney Name]
[Firm Name]
[Address]

[Bar Number]

## Common Arguments by Issue

### Evasive Answer

> "Defendant's response is evasive because it fails to directly answer the 
> question posed. Under CR 37.01(c), an evasive answer is treated as a 
> failure to answer. Defendant must provide a direct, complete response."

### Improper "Lack of Information"

> "Defendant claims to lack sufficient information to respond. However, 
> CR 33.02 requires that a party make reasonable inquiry before claiming 
> lack of knowledge. The information requested is [in Defendant's possession / 
> readily available to Defendant], and Defendant's claim of ignorance is 
> not credible."

### Overbroad Objection

> "Defendant's objection that the request is 'overbroad' is itself 
> conclusory. Defendant has not explained why the scope is unreasonable 
> or what limited scope would be appropriate. Moreover, even if some 
> limitation were warranted, Defendant was required to respond to the 
> extent the request is valid."

### Privilege Without Log

> "Defendant asserts privilege but has failed to provide a privilege log 
> as required. Without a log identifying the specific documents withheld 
> and the basis for each privilege claim, the Court cannot evaluate 
> whether the privilege applies."
