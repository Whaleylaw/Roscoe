# Defense Answer Review Workflow

## Purpose

This workflow analyzes defense answers to identify Rule 8(b) violations, frivolous denials, and opportunities to challenge deficient responses. Based on CR 8.01 requirements and strategic discovery principles.

---

## Overview

Under CR 8.01(b), a party must:
- **Admit** allegations that are true
- **Deny** allegations that are false (with specificity)
- **State lack of knowledge** only when genuinely lacking knowledge after reasonable inquiry

Improper denials and evasive responses create opportunities to:
1. File motions to strike
2. Deem facts admitted
3. Establish bad faith for sanctions
4. Narrow issues for trial

---

## Step 1: Obtain and Organize Documents

### Required Documents
- [ ] Plaintiff's Complaint (or Amended Complaint)
- [ ] Defendant's Answer
- [ ] Any responses to requests for admission
- [ ] Defendant's interrogatory responses
- [ ] Defendant's deposition transcript (if available)

### Create Comparison Table

| Complaint Paragraph | Allegation Summary | Defendant's Response | Type | Issue? |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------|--------|
| ¶1 | Plaintiff is resident of Jefferson Co. | Denied | General Denial | Likely frivolous |
| ¶2 | Defendant operates business at [address] | Admitted | Admission | No issue |
| ¶3 | Collision occurred on [date] | Denied | Specific Denial | Check evidence |

---

## Step 2: Categorize Each Response

### Response Types

| Response | CR 8.01 Requirement | Validity Check |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Admission** | Allegation admitted as true | Valid |
| **Specific Denial** | Specific facts denied | Valid if defendant has basis |
| **General Denial** | All allegations denied | Only valid if ALL allegations false |
| **Lack of Information** | Cannot admit or deny | Only valid after reasonable inquiry |
| **Evasive/Incomplete** | Neither admits nor denies | Treat as admission |

---

## Step 3: Identify Problematic Responses

### Red Flags for Frivolous Denials

1. **Denying Obvious Facts**
   - Plaintiff's name and residence
   - Date and location of incident
   - Defendant's identity or business address
   - Facts documented in police report or public records

2. **Inconsistent Denials**
   - Facts defendant admitted elsewhere (interrogatories, deposition)
   - Facts defendant's own documents confirm
   - Facts defendant's insurance company admits

3. **Improper "Lack of Information"**
   - Facts within defendant's own knowledge
   - Facts defendant should know from own records
   - Facts easily verifiable by defendant

4. **Blanket General Denials**
   - Denying all allegations without specificity
   - Only proper if defendant denies everything including own identity

---

## Step 4: Document Contradictions

### Create Contradiction Log

| Allegation | Answer Response | Contradicting Evidence | Source |
|------------|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| Defendant was driving | "Lacks information" | Police report names defendant | Exhibit A |
| Collision occurred at Main St. | "Denied" | Defendant's insurance claim states Main St. | Exhibit B |
| Plaintiff was injured | "Denied" | Defendant's adjuster's notes acknowledge injury | Exhibit C |

---

## Step 5: Evaluate Strategic Options

### Decision Matrix

| Issue Found | Options | Recommendation |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Frivolous denial of basic facts | Motion to strike, RFAs, deposition | File RFAs first, then depo |
| Inconsistent with prior statements | Deposition, impeachment prep | Document for cross-exam |
| Improper "lack of information" | Motion to compel admission | Send targeted RFAs |
| General denial improper | Motion to strike | May be overkill - use RFAs |

### Strategic Considerations

1. **Timing:** Early motions may educate defense; late challenges preserve surprise
2. **Cost-Benefit:** Motion practice is expensive—pick battles wisely
3. **Preservation:** Document issues even if not immediately challenging
4. **Trial Use:** Frivolous denials can support attorney fee awards

---

## Step 6: Prepare Follow-Up Discovery

### Targeted Requests for Admission

For each frivolous denial, prepare RFA targeting the specific fact:

```markdown
**REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. X:**
ADMIT that on [date], a motor vehicle collision occurred at [location].

**REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. X:**
ADMIT that [Defendant's Name] was operating [vehicle description] at the time of the collision.

**REQUEST FOR ADMISSION NO. X:**
ADMIT that [Plaintiff's Name] was injured in the collision.
```

### Targeted Interrogatories

```markdown
**INTERROGATORY NO. X:**
In your Answer, you denied [allegation]. State every fact supporting your denial.

**INTERROGATORY NO. X:**
In your Answer, you stated you lacked information to admit or deny [allegation]. 
Describe the reasonable inquiry you made before asserting lack of information.
```

---

## Step 7: Consider Formal Challenge

### Motion to Strike (CR 12.06)

**When to File:**
- Clear CR 8.01 violation
- Pattern of frivolous denials
- Strategic value outweighs cost

**Elements:**
1. Quote specific allegation
2. Quote defendant's response
3. Cite evidence contradicting denial
4. Cite CR 8.01 requirements
5. Request specific relief (deem admitted, strike answer)

### Motion to Compel (CR 37)

**When to File:**
- Evasive or incomplete responses
- Improper "lack of information" claims
- Failure to respond after deadline

---

## Step 8: Preserve for Trial

### Create Trial Folder

Document for use at trial:
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison of frivolous denials vs. evidence
- [ ] Deposition excerpts contradicting denials
- [ ] RFA responses (especially if later proven true for CR 36.02 costs)
- [ ] Timeline showing defendant knew facts when denying

### Attorney Fee Recovery

Under CR 36.02, if party denies RFA and requesting party later proves it true:
- Reasonable expenses of proof recoverable
- Including attorney fees
- Unless denial was reasonable or admission would be prejudicial
