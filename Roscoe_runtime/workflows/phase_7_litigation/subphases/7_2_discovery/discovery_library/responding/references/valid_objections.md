# Valid Discovery Objections Guide

## Overview

This guide explains when each type of discovery objection is valid under Kentucky law. Objections must be specific and made in good faith—boilerplate objections without basis may be deemed waived.

## Privilege Objections

### Attorney-Client Privilege

**When Valid:**
- Communication between attorney and client
- Made for purpose of obtaining legal advice
- Intended to be confidential
- Privilege not waived by disclosure to third parties

**Requirements:**
- Must create privilege log identifying withheld documents
- Privilege log must contain: date, author, recipients, subject matter, basis for privilege

**Waiver:**
- Disclosure to third parties (including testifying experts)
- Crime-fraud exception
- Putting privileged communications "at issue"

### Work Product Doctrine

**When Valid:**
- Documents or tangible things
- Prepared in anticipation of litigation
- By or for attorney or party's representative
- Two types:
  - **Ordinary work product:** Can be discovered on showing substantial need
  - **Opinion work product:** Mental impressions, conclusions, legal theories—nearly absolute protection

**Requirements:**
- Must demonstrate documents were prepared because of anticipated litigation
- Not documents prepared in ordinary course of business

### Other Privileges

| Privilege | Basis | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Physician-Patient | KRE 507 | Waived if patient puts condition at issue |
| Psychotherapist-Patient | KRE 507 | Similar to physician-patient |
| Spousal | KRE 504 | Two types: testimonial and confidential communications |
| Self-Incrimination | Fifth Amendment | Cannot be compelled to provide incriminating info |

## Scope Objections

### Overbroad

**When Valid:**
- Request encompasses information far beyond what is relevant
- Time period requested is unreasonably long
- Geographic scope is unreasonably broad
- Request could encompass thousands of documents without limitation

**How to Assert:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is overbroad in that it seeks [describe breadth]. 
Without waiving this objection, Defendant will respond with respect to 
[limited scope].
```

**Note:** Should still respond to reasonable portion of request.

### Unduly Burdensome

**When Valid:**
- Responding would require disproportionate time or expense
- Information available from less burdensome source
- Burden substantially outweighs likely benefit

**Requirements:**
- Must be prepared to demonstrate actual burden (affidavit may be required)
- Cannot merely assert "burdensome" without specifics
- Courts balance burden against need for information

### Irrelevant / Not Calculated to Lead to Discovery of Admissible Evidence

**When Valid:**
- Information has no bearing on any claim or defense
- No reasonable possibility it could lead to admissible evidence

**Caution:**
- Discovery standard is broader than admissibility
- "Relevant to subject matter" is very broad
- Rarely a complete defense to discovery

## Form Objections

### Vague and Ambiguous

**When Valid:**
- Key terms are undefined
- Request could reasonably be interpreted multiple ways
- Responding party genuinely cannot determine what is sought

**How to Handle:**
- Request clarification from propounding party
- If still unclear, object and state what interpretation was used

### Compound

**When Valid (Interrogatories Only):**
- Single interrogatory contains multiple discrete questions
- Used to circumvent interrogatory limits
- Kentucky allows 30 interrogatories including subparts

**Not Valid For:**
- Requests for production (single request can seek category of documents)
- Requests for admission

### Calls for Legal Conclusion

**When Valid:**
- Request asks for legal opinion or conclusion
- Requests party to apply law to facts

**How to Handle:**
- Object, but provide factual basis for claims/defenses
- "Contention interrogatories" asking for facts supporting claims are valid

---

## Other Valid Objections

### Already Answered

**When Valid:**
- Same information requested in prior discovery
- Information previously provided in this litigation

**Note:** Should reference where previously provided.

### Equally Available

**When Valid:**
- Information available from public records
- Information equally accessible to propounding party
- Not a valid objection for information uniquely in responding party's possession

### Third Party Privacy

**When Valid:**
- Request seeks confidential information of non-parties
- Medical records, financial records of third parties

**How to Handle:**
- May require protective order
- May require redaction of identifying information

### Trade Secret / Confidential Business Information

**When Valid:**
- Genuinely proprietary information
- Disclosure would cause competitive harm

**How to Handle:**
- Protective order is proper remedy, not refusal to produce
- May require confidentiality designation

## Invalid / Weak Objections

| Objection | Why Invalid |
|-----------|------------|
| "Irrelevant" (blanket) | Discovery is broader than admissibility |
| "Burdensome" (without specifics) | Must show actual burden |
| "Overbroad" (without limiting response) | Should respond to reasonable scope |
| "Fishing expedition" | Discovery is designed to allow fact-finding |
| "Already in your possession" | Not valid for information in responding party's control |
| "Subject to objection" (then full response) | Waives the objection |

---

## Consequences of Improper Objections

1. **Waiver:** Boilerplate objections may be deemed waived
2. **Sanctions:** CR 37 allows sanctions for improper objections
3. **Attorney's Fees:** May be ordered to pay propounding party's costs
4. **Compelled Response:** Court may order response over objection
5. **Adverse Inference:** In extreme cases, court may instruct jury

---

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific:** State exact grounds for each objection
2. **Object and Respond:** When possible, object but still respond
3. **Preserve Privileges:** Create privilege log immediately
4. **Meet and Confer:** Attempt to resolve disputes before motion practice
5. **Good Faith:** Only object where genuinely warranted
6. **Document Burden:** If claiming burden, be prepared to prove it
