## Standard General Objections Block

```markdown
## GENERAL OBJECTIONS

Plaintiff/Defendant makes the following general objections to Defendant's/Plaintiff's discovery requests. These objections are incorporated by reference into each specific response below as if fully stated therein.

1. **Scope Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any instruction, definition, or request that purports to impose obligations beyond those required by the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure.

2. **Privilege Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request to the extent it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege, or any other applicable privilege or protection. Plaintiff/Defendant does not waive any privilege by responding to these requests, and any inadvertent disclosure of privileged information shall not constitute a waiver.

3. **Reservation of Rights:** These responses reflect the current state of Plaintiff's/Defendant's knowledge, investigation, and understanding. Plaintiff/Defendant reserves the right to supplement, amend, clarify, or correct any response as additional information is obtained through discovery or otherwise.

4. **Non-Admission:** By providing information in response to these requests, Plaintiff/Defendant does not admit or concede that such information is relevant, material, or admissible for any purpose.

5. **Relevance Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request that is not relevant to the subject matter of this action or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

6. **Overbreadth Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request that is overly broad, unduly burdensome, or oppressive in scope or time frame.

7. **Vagueness Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request that is vague, ambiguous, or unintelligible such that Plaintiff/Defendant cannot reasonably determine what is being requested.

8. **Equal Availability Objection:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request that seeks information equally available to the propounding party from their own investigation or from public sources.

9. **Third Party Privacy:** Plaintiff/Defendant objects to any request that seeks confidential or private information of third parties who are not parties to this action.

## Individual Objection Language

### Privilege Objections

**Attorney-Client Privilege:**
```
OBJECTION: This request seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege. Specifically, the request calls for disclosure of confidential communications between Plaintiff/Defendant and counsel made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.
```

**Work Product:**
```
OBJECTION: This request seeks documents or information protected by the work product doctrine. The materials sought were prepared in anticipation of litigation by counsel or at counsel's direction.
```

**Combined Privilege:**
```
OBJECTION: This request seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or the work product doctrine. A privilege log is provided identifying documents withheld on this basis.
```

### Scope Objections

**Overbroad - Time:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is overbroad as to time. The request seeks information from [X] years [before/after] the incident, which is not relevant to any claim or defense in this action. Without waiving this objection, Plaintiff/Defendant will respond for the period [specific timeframe].
```

**Overbroad - Subject Matter:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is overbroad in scope. As written, the request could encompass [describe breadth]. Without waiving this objection, Plaintiff/Defendant will respond with respect to [limited scope].
```

**Unduly Burdensome:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is unduly burdensome. Responding would require [describe burden, e.g., "review of thousands of documents," "extensive computer searches," "disproportionate time and expense"]. The burden of responding substantially outweighs the likely benefit of the information sought.
```

### Form Objections

**Vague and Ambiguous:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is vague and ambiguous. The terms "[specific term]" are undefined and could be interpreted multiple ways. Plaintiff/Defendant cannot reasonably determine what information is being sought.
```

**Compound:**
```
OBJECTION: This interrogatory is compound in that it contains multiple discrete questions. Per CR 33.01, interrogatories must be answered separately, and compound questions improperly circumvent the limit on interrogatories.
```

**Calls for Legal Conclusion:**
```
OBJECTION: This request improperly calls for a legal conclusion. Plaintiff/Defendant is not required to state legal conclusions. Without waiving this objection, Plaintiff/Defendant will provide the factual basis for [claim/defense].
```

### Relevance Objections

**Not Relevant:**
```
OBJECTION: This request seeks information that is not relevant to any claim or defense in this action and is not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
```

**Proportionality:**
```
OBJECTION: This request is not proportional to the needs of this case. The burden and expense of responding outweighs the likely benefit of the information, considering the importance of the issues, the amount in controversy, and the parties' relative access to relevant information.

## Notes on Objection Strategy

### Do:
- State specific grounds for each objection
- Object where genuinely warranted
- Still respond to non-objectionable portions
- Preserve objections for appeal

### Don't:
- Assert boilerplate objections without basis
- Object to everything (invites motion to compel)
- Waive legitimate objections by responding fully
- Fail to create privilege log when asserting privilege
