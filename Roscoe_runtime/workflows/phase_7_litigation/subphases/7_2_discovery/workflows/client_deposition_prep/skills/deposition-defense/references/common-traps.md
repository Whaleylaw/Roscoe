## Trap Questions and How to Handle

### The "Always/Never" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: You always come to a complete stop at stop signs, don't you?
```

**Problem:** Nobody always does anything. A "yes" can be used to impeach.

**How to handle:**
```
A: I try to. I can't say I've never made a mistake.
```

### The Summarizing Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: So what you're saying is [incorrect summary of testimony]?
```

**Problem:** Defense is putting words in client's mouth.

**How to handle:**
```
A: No, that's not what I said. What I said was [correct version].
```

---

### The "Anything Else" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: Is there anything else you remember about the accident?
A: No.
Q: So your testimony is complete and you won't remember 
   anything else later?
```

**Problem:** Defense wants to lock client out of adding information.

**How to handle:**
```
A: That's everything I can remember right now.
```

---

### The Document Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: I'm showing you Exhibit 3. This says you were going 50 mph. 
   That's what you told the officer, right?
```

**Problem:** Client may not remember what they told officer.

**How to handle:**
```
A: I'd need to review the entire report. I told the officer 
   what I believed at the time.
```

### The "Impeachment Setup" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: Tell me everything about your neck problems before this accident.
A: I didn't have any.
Q: [Shows medical record with prior neck treatment]
```

**Problem:** Client forgot or didn't think it was relevant.

**How to handle:** Prepare client thoroughly on prior medical history.
```
A: I had some minor neck stiffness years ago that resolved 
   completely. This injury is completely different.
```

---

### The "Help Me Understand" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: Help me understand how you can have all these problems but 
   still go to work every day?
```

**Problem:** Sounds friendly but is trying to minimize injuries.

**How to handle:**
```
A: I have to work to pay my bills. That doesn't mean I'm not 
   in pain while I do it.
```

---

### The "Isn't It Possible" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: Isn't it possible you didn't see the light until after 
   the collision?
```

**Problem:** Anything is "possible."

**How to handle:**
```
A: No, I saw it before the accident. It was green.
```

---

### The "Feelings" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: How did you feel when you got home that day?
```

**Problem:** Vague question that can lead anywhere.

**How to handle:**
```
A: What do you mean - physically or emotionally?
```

---

### The "Would You Agree" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: Would you agree that a reasonable person would have seen 
   the defendant's car coming?
```

**Problem:** Leading question that assumes facts.

**How to handle:**
```
A: I can only tell you what I saw.
```

---

### The "Social Media" Trap

**Example:**
```
Q: I see on your Facebook you went to a concert. How could you 
   do that if you're in so much pain?
```

**Problem:** Activities may look inconsistent with claimed injuries.

**How to handle:**
Prepare client in advance. Be truthful.
```
A: I went because my daughter wanted me to. I was in pain the 
   whole time and had to sit most of the night.
```
