## Common Mistakes

1. **Too vague**: "Email regarding case" - doesn't establish privilege
2. **Reveals content**: Don't describe the actual advice given
3. **Missing elements**: Must show all privilege elements apply
4. **Blanket logs**: Each document needs individual entry

## Challenging Privilege Claims

If defendant's privilege log is deficient:
1. Meet and confer
2. Request more detail
3. Move to compel if insufficient
4. Request in camera review

## Waiver Considerations

Privilege may be waived by:
- Voluntary disclosure
- Failure to claim privilege timely
- Disclosure to third parties
- Putting privileged matter "at issue"

**To avoid waiver:**
- Assert privilege in timely response
- Maintain confidentiality
- Use proper log format
- Claw back inadvertent disclosures promptly
