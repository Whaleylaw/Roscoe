# Request for Admission Templates Reference

## Strategic Use of RFAs

RFAs are powerful because:
- If not answered in 30 days, deemed admitted
- Admitted facts can't be disputed at trial
- Reduce issues for trial

**Best Practices:**
- Focus on undisputed facts
- Request document authenticity
- Be specific and clear
- Don't ask for legal conclusions
