# Response Analysis Skill

## Overview

Systematically evaluate discovery responses to identify deficiencies requiring follow-up.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Reviewing defendant's discovery responses
- Need to identify evasive or incomplete answers
- Evaluating objections for validity
- Preparing meet and confer letter

DO NOT use if:
- Reviewing our own responses before service
- Analyzing deposition testimony

## Workflow

### Step 1: Catalog Each Response

For each response, note:
- Answer provided or objection only
- Completeness of answer
- Documents promised vs. produced

### Step 2: Evaluate Objections

Check if objection is:
- Properly stated
- Valid grounds
- Waiving answer entirely or answering subject to

**See:** `references/deficiency-checklist.md` for evaluation criteria.

### Step 3: Compare to Request

Did response actually answer what was asked?

| Issue | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Non-responsive | Asked for witnesses, got documents |
| Incomplete | Listed "some" witnesses |
| Evasive | "See documents" without identification |

### Step 4: Document Deficiencies

Create deficiency list for meet and confer.

**See:** `references/motion-to-compel.md` for escalation process.
