**Re: Your Personal Injury Claim - Upcoming Deposition**

**Deposition Date:** [DEPOSITION DATE]  
**Deposition Time:** [DEPOSITION TIME]  
**Location:** [DEPOSITION LOCATION]

Dear {{client.name}},

You have been scheduled for a deposition in your case. This letter explains what to expect and how to prepare.

## What is a Deposition?

A deposition is a sworn statement that you will give before a court reporter. The attorney for the opposing side will ask you questions about your case. We will be present with you at this deposition.

**A deposition is nothing to fear.** It is a normal part of a civil case and allows the opposing parties an opportunity to meet you and evaluate your testimony. They will also inquire about your background, the facts of the case, and the injuries and damages you have suffered.

## Pre-Deposition Meeting

Before your deposition, I need to meet with you to discuss your case and prepare you for your testimony.

**Please arrive thirty (30) minutes before the deposition is scheduled to begin** so that we may discuss your testimony and address any last-minute questions.

## Key Guidelines for Your Testimony

### Tell the Truth

In a lawsuit, as in all other matters, **honesty is the best policy**. You are under oath and must tell the truth, even with respect to details that may be unfavorable. Do not exaggerate.

Telling the truth means that you testify accurately about what you know. Any other witness is compelled to do the same.

### Professional Appearance

Your appearance and behavior at the deposition are very important, as they will make a strong impression on the opposing parties.

- Wear what you would normally wear to an important occasion (church, wedding, or important business meeting)
- Make sure what you wear is comfortable
- Maintain good posture

### Behavior and Demeanor

- **Do not lose your temper or get excited** during the deposition
- If you get angry, you will make a bad impression
- Always be polite to the opposing attorney
- Address the attorney properly ("Mr./Ms." or "sir/ma'am")

### Answering Questions

- **Listen carefully** to each question before answering
- Answer questions as completely and truthfully as you can
- **Do not try to anticipate** what the attorney is going to ask
- When answering, **look the attorney directly in the eye** - eye contact indicates sincerity and truthfulness

### If You Don't Know

- If you do not know the answer to a question, simply say **"I don't know"**
- **Do not guess** on your answers
- If you realize you gave an incorrect answer, **correct it immediately**

### Uncertain Answers

If you are not positive about an answer, qualify your response:
- "To the best of my knowledge..."
- "I believe..."

**Do not lock yourself into an answer if you are not certain.**

### Estimates

**Be careful** on questions involving distances and time. If you make an estimate, make sure everyone understands that you are estimating.

### Objections

If the attorney for the other side asks an improper question, we will object before you answer. This is normal procedure.

- **Follow our instructions exactly**
- Answer only the questions we advise you to answer
- Do not answer questions we advise you not to answer

### Speak Clearly

- Give **audible verbal answers** so the court reporter can record them
- Do not nod your head "yes" or otherwise answer with a nonverbal gesture
- Speak loudly enough so everyone can hear you
- Do not chew gum
- Keep your hands away from your mouth

### Take Your Time

If you need to:
- Stop the deposition to ask us a question - you have the right to do that
- Use the restroom or get something to drink - the deposition can be paused

**It is normal to be nervous before a deposition.**

### Our Role

In a discovery deposition, it is possible that we will not ask you any questions. However, if appropriate, we might ask you questions after the opposing attorney has finished questioning you.

## What to Bring

Please bring with you:
- A valid photo ID
- Any documents we have asked you to review
- Any notes or records that might help refresh your memory (we will discuss these beforehand)

## Questions

If you have any questions about the deposition or this letter, please do not hesitate to contact our office.

Sincerely,

**{{firm.name}}**
