# Form Objections Guide

## Overview

In discovery depositions, objections are limited to issues of **form**. Substantive objections (relevance, hearsay) are automatically preserved under CR 32.04 and need not be made.

**Key Principle:** Object to form issues or they are **waived forever**. Substantive objections are preserved even if not made.

## The Nine Core Form Objections

### 1. Leading

**Definition:** Question suggests the answer to the witness.

**Trigger:** Question contains the answer the examiner wants.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "You were going about 25 miles per hour, weren't you?"
- ✓ "How fast were you going?"
- ❌ "The light was green when you entered the intersection, correct?"
- ✓ "What color was the light when you entered the intersection?"

**Objection:** "Objection, leading."

---

### 2. Calls for Speculation

**Definition:** Question asks witness to guess about something they don't know.

**Trigger:** Question asks about matters beyond witness's knowledge or asks "what if" hypotheticals.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "What was the defendant thinking at that moment?"
- ❌ "What would have happened if you had turned left instead?"
- ❌ "Why do you think they did that?"

**Objection:** "Objection, calls for speculation."

---

### 3. Asked and Answered

**Definition:** Same question has already been asked and answered.

**Trigger:** Repetitive questioning, often in slightly different form.

**Examples:**
- Same question asked multiple times
- Slight rephrasing of already-answered question
- Badgering by circling back to same topic repeatedly

**Objection:** "Objection, asked and answered."

**Note:** Particularly important when pattern suggests harassment.

---

### 4. Argumentative

**Definition:** Question is designed to argue with or harass the witness rather than elicit facts.

**Trigger:** Questions that argue, accuse, or are designed to annoy/embarrass.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "If you had been paying attention, this never would have happened, would it?"
- ❌ "So you're saying everyone else is lying?"
- ❌ "How can you possibly expect anyone to believe that?"

**Objection:** "Objection, argumentative."

**Escalation:** Pattern of argumentative questions may trigger CR 30.04 motion.

---

### 5. Assumes Facts Not in Evidence

**Definition:** Question presumes facts that haven't been established.

**Trigger:** Question contains factual premise that witness hasn't testified to and isn't in evidence.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "After the defendant threw the bottle, what happened?" (no evidence of bottle-throwing)
- ❌ "When you ran the stop sign, how fast were you going?" (not established that witness ran stop sign)
- ❌ "What did you do with the money you received?" (not established that witness received money)

**Objection:** "Objection, assumes facts not in evidence."

---

### 6. Calls for Legal Conclusion

**Definition:** Question asks lay witness to give legal opinion.

**Trigger:** Question asks about legal standards, negligence, fault, rights, obligations.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Was the defendant negligent?"
- ❌ "Did the defendant breach their duty?"
- ❌ "Was that a violation of the law?"
- ❌ "Who was at fault for the accident?"

**Objection:** "Objection, calls for a legal conclusion."

---

### 7. Lacks Foundation

**Definition:** Question presumes facts or expertise not yet established.

**Trigger:** No factual predicate laid for the question.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "What is the standard of care for treating this condition?" (to lay witness)
- ❌ "What speed would be safe on that road?" (without establishing witness's knowledge)
- ❌ "Was the defendant intoxicated?" (without establishing how witness would know)

**Objection:** "Objection, lacks foundation."

---

### 8. Compound

**Definition:** Question contains multiple questions in one.

**Trigger:** Question uses "and" or "or" to combine multiple inquiries.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "What time did you leave and where were you going?"
- ❌ "Did you see or hear anything before the impact?"
- ❌ "Tell me about your medical treatment and lost wages."

**Objection:** "Objection, compound. Can you break that into separate questions?"

---

### 9. Calls for Narrative

**Definition:** Question is so broad it invites rambling, non-responsive answer.

**Trigger:** Open-ended question without boundaries.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Tell me everything that happened."
- ❌ "Describe your entire medical history."
- ❌ "What do you know about this case?"

**Objection:** "Objection, calls for a narrative."

**Note:** Not all open-ended questions are objectionable; this applies to excessively broad questions.

## When in Doubt

**Object.** It's better to make an unnecessary objection than to waive one that should have been made. Unnecessary objections are harmless; waived objections can permanently damage the case.
