## Closing Procedures

### Before Deposition Ends

- [ ] Confirm opposing counsel has no more questions

**Decision: Ask Questions?**

Generally in discovery depositions, we do NOT ask questions that would:

- Commit client to additional testimony

May ask questions to:
- Clarify a confusing answer
- Correct a clear misstatement
- Rehabilitate after damaging admission

### Transcript Handling

**Read and Sign Options:**

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Reserve right | Client can review and make corrections (errata sheet) |
| Waive | Transcript final as recorded |

**Generally:** Reserve the right to read and sign. This allows for correction of errors.
