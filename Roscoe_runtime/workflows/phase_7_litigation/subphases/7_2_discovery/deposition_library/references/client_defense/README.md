## Kentucky Rules Framework

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| CR 26.02(1) | Scope of discovery |
| CR 30.02(1) | Deposition notice requirements |
| CR 30.03(3) | Objection conduct and instructions not to answer |
| CR 30.04 | Motion to terminate for bad faith |
| CR 32.04 | Waiver rules for objections |
| KRE 503 | Attorney-client privilege |

## Key Principles

1. **Preparation is Everything** - A well-prepared client is confident and gives better testimony
2. **Form Objections Only** - In discovery depositions, only object to form; substantive objections are preserved
3. **Limited Instructions Not to Answer** - Only for privilege, court order, or CR 30.04 motion
4. **Protect the Record** - Timely objections preserve issues; missed objections are waived
