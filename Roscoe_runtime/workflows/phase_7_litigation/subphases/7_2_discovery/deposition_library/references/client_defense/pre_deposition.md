## Phase 2: Client Preparation Sessions

### Session 1: Process Overview and Rules

**Topics to Cover:**

1. **What is a Deposition**
   - Sworn testimony under oath
   - Transcript becomes evidence
   - Opposing counsel asking questions
   - We will be present but limited in involvement

2. **Who Will Be Present**
   - Client
   - Our attorney(s)
   - Opposing counsel
   - Court reporter
   - Videographer (if video deposition)

3. **Fundamental Testimony Rules**

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| Tell the truth | You are under oath; lying is perjury |
| Listen completely | Hear entire question before answering |
| Answer what is asked | Don't volunteer extra information |
| "I don't know" is okay | If you don't know, say so |
| Don't guess | Estimates are okay, guessing is not |
| Take your time | No rush; think before speaking |
| Ask for clarification | If question is confusing, ask |
| Verbal answers only | Court reporter can't record nods |

---

   - Prior medical conditions
   - Prior accidents or claims

3. **The Incident**
   - What happened (chronologically)
   - What client saw, heard, felt
   - What client did before, during, after

4. **Injuries and Treatment**
   - Initial symptoms
   - Medical treatment received
   - Current condition
   - Ongoing limitations

5. **Damages**

---

### Session 3: Problem Areas

**Address Difficult Topics:**

| Potential Problem | Preparation Strategy |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Prior injuries to same body part | Acknowledge honestly; explain difference |
| Gaps in treatment | Explain reasons (insurance, work, etc.) |
| Social media posts | Review and prepare to explain context |
| Criminal history | Prepare truthful, non-defensive response |
| Inconsistent prior statements | Review and prepare to clarify |
| Unfavorable facts | Acknowledge honestly; don't minimize |

**Practice Mock Questions:**
- Practice describing accident clearly and concisely
- Practice handling difficult questions
- Build confidence through repetition

---

## Phase 3: Privilege and Protection Issues

### Privileged Topics (CR 30.03(3))

**Instruction Not to Answer - Only These Three Bases:**

1. **Preserve Privilege**
   - Attorney-client communications
   - Work product materials
   - Example: "What did your attorney tell you about this case?"

2. **Enforce Court Limitation**
   - Any protective orders in place
   - Specific topics prohibited by court order

3. **Present CR 30.04 Motion**
   - When examination conducted in bad faith
   - When questions unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress

### Privilege Assertion Language

Prepare client to respond:
> "My attorney has instructed me not to answer that question."

Then wait for attorney instruction.

---

## Phase 4: Objection Preparation

### Form Objection Quick Reference

| Objection | Trigger | Example Question |
|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Leading | Suggests answer | "You started at 3pm, didn't you?" |
| Calls for Speculation | Asks to guess | "What if you had gone elsewhere?" |
| Asked and Answered | Repetitive | Same question multiple times |
| Argumentative | Harassing | "If you had paid attention, this wouldn't have happened?" |
| Assumes Facts Not in Evidence | Presumes unestablished facts | "After he threw the bottle..." (no bottle evidence) |
| Calls for Legal Conclusion | Legal opinion | "Was the defendant negligent?" |
| Lacks Foundation | No predicate | Expert questions without establishing expertise |
| Compound | Multiple questions | "Where were you going and what time did you leave?" |
| Calls for Narrative | Too broad | "Tell me everything that happened" |

### When We Object

- We will state "Objection" followed by the basis
- This preserves the issue for trial
- Client still answers UNLESS instructed not to
- Form objections only; substance preserved automatically
