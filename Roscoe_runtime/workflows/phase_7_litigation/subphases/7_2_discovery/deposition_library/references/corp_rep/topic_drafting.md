3. Corporation can adequately **prepare** the witness

## Good vs. Bad Topics

### ❌ Bad: Too Vague

```
"All information about the accident."
```
**Problem:** What "information"? No boundaries.

### ✓ Good: Specific

```
"All facts known to [Corporation] concerning the collision that occurred 
on [date] at [location], including the identity of all persons with 
knowledge of such facts."
```
**Why Better:** Specific event, date, location, defined scope.

---

### ❌ Bad: Overbroad

```
"All safety policies."
```
**Problem:** Which policies? What time period? What subject matter?

### ✓ Good: Limited

```
"[Corporation's] policies and procedures regarding floor maintenance 
and inspection in effect at [Store Location] on [date of incident]."
```
**Why Better:** Specific subject, location, time frame.

---

### ❌ Bad: Asks for Legal Conclusion

```
"Whether [Corporation] was negligent."
```
**Problem:** Asks for legal opinion, not facts.

### ✓ Good: Asks for Facts

```
"[Corporation's] actions and decisions regarding [subject] on [date], 
including who made such decisions and the basis therefor."
```
**Why Better:** Facts, not legal conclusions.

## Avoiding Common Objections

### Objection: "Vague and Overbroad"

**Prevention:**
- Add date ranges
- Specify locations
- Limit subject matter
- Include specific sub-elements

### Objection: "Unduly Burdensome"

**Prevention:**
- Focus on relevant time periods
- Limit to relevant locations/departments
- Avoid "all" without qualifiers
- Be reasonable in scope

### Objection: "Calls for Legal Conclusion"

**Prevention:**
- Ask for facts, not opinions
- Ask for "contention" not "whether negligent"
- Focus on what was done, not whether it was proper

## Coordinated Document Requests

**Best Practice:** Serve RFP at least 60 days before deposition with document categories aligned to deposition topics.

**Why:**
- Prevents document dump on deposition day
- Ensures documents reviewed before deposition
- Creates clear record of what was/wasn't produced

**Alignment Example:**

| Deposition Topic | Corresponding RFP Request |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| "Policies regarding floor maintenance" | "All policies regarding floor maintenance" |
| "Training on safety procedures" | "All training materials on safety procedures" |
| "Investigation of incident" | "All investigation reports and notes" |
