# Handling "Know-Nothing" Witnesses

## Overview

A "know-nothing" witness is a corporate representative who cannot answer questions on topics listed in the deposition notice. This is often **more valuable** than a prepared witness because it demonstrates corporate failure to comply with discovery obligations.

## Recognizing the "Know-Nothing" Witness

### Warning Signs

| Sign | Example |
|------|---------|
| Claims lack of knowledge | "I don't know" to basic questions |
| Unable to explain documents | "I've never seen this before" |
| Defers to others | "You'd have to ask someone else" |
| Limited preparation | "I only reviewed a few documents" |
| Wrong department | Witness is from unrelated area |

## Strategic Response

### Do NOT Get Frustrated

A know-nothing witness is a **strategic opportunity**, not a problem.

**Why This is Valuable:**
1. Documents corporation's failure to comply with CR 30.02(6)
2. Creates record for motion to compel
3. May support sanctions motion
4. Demonstrates corporate indifference at trial
5. May support adverse inference at trial

## Building the Record

### Step 1: Establish Designation

```
Q. You are here today as the corporate representative of [Corporation], correct?
Q. You were designated by [Corporation] to testify on its behalf today?
Q. You understand your testimony will bind [Corporation]?
Q. You were designated to testify on the topics listed in the deposition notice?
```

### Step 2: Confirm Preparation (or Lack Thereof)

```
Q. How did you prepare for this deposition?
Q. Who did you speak with to prepare?
Q. What documents did you review?
Q. How much time did you spend preparing?
Q. Were you provided with documents related to [topic]?
Q. Did anyone at [Corporation] explain [topic] to you?
```

### Step 3: Document the Failure Topic by Topic

For each topic where witness lacks knowledge:

```
Q. Topic [#] of the notice asks about [topic]. Are you prepared to testify 
   on that topic?
Q. [If no] So [Corporation] is unable to answer questions about [topic] today?
Q. Despite receiving notice of this deposition with that topic listed?
Q. Did [Corporation] make any effort to identify someone who could answer 
   questions about [topic]?
Q. Is there anyone at [Corporation] who has knowledge of [topic]?
Q. [If yes] Why wasn't that person designated to testify?
```

### Step 4: Establish Corporate Failure

```
Q. So [Corporation's] position is that it simply doesn't know [information]?
Q. [Corporation] maintains no records regarding [topic]?
Q. No one at [Corporation] has knowledge of [topic]?
Q. Is this information that [Corporation] should have?
```

## Red Flags for Escalation

| Red Flag | Escalation Action |
|----------|-------------------|
| Witness designated on no topics | Stop; demand proper designation |
| Witness from wrong department | Document; consider adjournment |
| Pattern across multiple topics | Build record for motion |
| Witness coached to "not know" | Document carefully; consider sanctions |
| Corporation produced no witness | Motion to compel; sanctions |

## Sample Exchange

```
Q. You are here as the corporate representative of ABC Company?
A. Yes.

Q. You were designated to testify on the topics in our notice?
A. Yes.

Q. Topic 3 asks about ABC's policies for inspecting floors. 
   Are you prepared to testify about that?
A. I'm not really familiar with those policies.

Q. Did ABC make any effort to prepare you on that topic?
A. Not really, no.

Q. Is there someone at ABC who knows about floor inspection policies?
A. I assume so, probably someone in facilities.

Q. Why wasn't that person designated to testify?
A. I don't know.

Q. So ABC chose to send you, knowing you couldn't answer questions 
   about floor inspection policies?
A. I guess so.

Q. And ABC's position is that it simply doesn't know its own floor 
   inspection policies?
A. I can only tell you what I know.

Q. Which is nothing about floor inspection policies?
A. That's correct.
