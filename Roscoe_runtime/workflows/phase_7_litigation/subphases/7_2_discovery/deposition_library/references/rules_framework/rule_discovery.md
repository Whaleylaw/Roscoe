**How to Extract Rules:**

## The Four-Part Test

For each candidate rule, verify it meets ALL four criteria:

### 1. Understandable

- [ ] Plain language
- [ ] Short and concise
- [ ] Immediately comprehensible to laypersons
- [ ] No jargon or technical terms

### 2. Undeniable

- [ ] So fundamental that disagreement damages credibility
- [ ] Would a reasonable person instantly agree?
- [ ] Does denial make witness look unreasonable?

### 3. Violated

- [ ] Clear evidence defendant breached this standard
- [ ] Specific conduct that violated the rule
- [ ] Evidence available to prove violation

### 4. Important

- [ ] Violation directly linked to client's harm
- [ ] Causation connection established
- [ ] Violation matters to outcome

## Rule Framing Guidelines

### Convert Permissive to Mandatory

**Before:** "Drivers should stop at stop signs."
**After:** "Drivers must stop at stop signs."

### Use Active Voice

**Before:** "Stop signs should be obeyed by all drivers."
**After:** "All drivers must obey stop signs."

### Keep It Simple

**Before:** "The operator of a motor vehicle approaching an intersection controlled by a stop sign shall bring the vehicle to a complete cessation of movement before proceeding."
**After:** "A driver must come to a complete stop at a stop sign."

### State as Affirmative Duty

**Before:** "Not following safety procedures is problematic."
**After:** "Employees must follow safety procedures."

## Rule Inventory Template

Create a table for all identified rules:

| Rule ID | Rule Text | Source | Citation | Applies To | Violation Evidence |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| R-001 | [Verbatim rule] | [Type] | [Specific cite] | [Case facts] | [Evidence] |
| R-002 | | | | | |
| R-003 | | | | | |

## Example: MVA Case

| Rule ID | Rule Text | Source | Citation |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|
| R-001 | A driver must come to a complete stop at a stop sign | Statute | KRS 189.330 |
| R-002 | A driver must yield to traffic already in the intersection | Statute | KRS 189.330 |
| R-003 | Before pulling into oncoming traffic, a driver should look left, right, and left again | Common Sense | |
| R-004 | A driver must maintain a proper lookout at all times | Jury Instruction | PJI 24.01 |
| R-005 | Drivers of commercial vehicles have a higher duty of care | Industry/Law | FMCSA |

## Organizing Rules for Deposition

### By Subject Matter

Group rules by topic for logical questioning flow:
- General safety principles
- Specific duty rules
- Company policy rules
- Industry standard rules

### By Strength

Prioritize:
1. Undeniable common sense (hardest to dispute)
2. Defendant's own policies (bound by own rules)
3. Industry standards (peer expectations)
4. Legal requirements (strongest authority)

### By Witness

Different witnesses may address different rules:
- Corporate rep: Company policies
- Employee: Training and procedures
- Manager: Supervision and enforcement
- Expert: Industry standards
