# Rules-Based Examination Framework Reference

## Overview

The rules-based examination framework is a strategic approach to deposition questioning that establishes general principles ("rules") before applying them to case-specific facts.

## Files in This Section

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `rule_discovery.md` | Finding and cataloging rules from authoritative sources |
| `question_frameworks.md` | Question templates by case type |
| `transcript_extraction.md` | Extracting rules from completed depositions |

## Workflow Integration

This reference supports the `party_depositions` workflow and the `rules-based-examination` skill.

## The Core Concept

### Traditional Approach (Less Effective)

1. Ask about facts of incident
2. Ask about policies
3. Hope witness makes damaging admission

### Rules-Based Approach (More Effective)

1. Establish general safety principles **in a vacuum**
2. Get agreement to common-sense rules
3. **Then** apply to case facts
4. Witness is trapped by prior agreements

## Why It Works

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Common sense first | Principles stated abstractly are hard to deny |
| No anticipation | Witness doesn't see where questions are going |
| Locked in | Once agreed, witness can't credibly backtrack |
| Closing ready | Creates ready-made argument structure |
| Credibility | Denial of common sense damages witness |

## The Four Characteristics of Effective Rules

Every rule you establish should be:

1. **Understandable** - Plain language, immediately comprehensible
2. **Undeniable** - So fundamental that disagreement damages credibility
3. **Violated** - Clear evidence defendant breached this standard
4. **Important** - Violation directly linked to client's harm
