## Key Principles

### Philosophy: Trial Testimony, Not Discovery

Expert depositions should be conducted as if they are trial testimony:
- Video recording for trial use
- Trial-use language in notice
- KRE 804 preservation notice
- Obtain admissions usable at trial

### Strategic Goals

| Goal | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Conflict Creation | Establish contradictions for impeachment |
| Credential Framing | Use expert's credentials against them |
| Rules of the Road | Establish principles expert cannot deny |
| Squaring Up | Confront with prior inconsistent testimony |
| Snap Judgment | Expose premature opinion formation |

### Kentucky Rules Framework

| Rule | Application |
|------|-------------|
| CR 26.02(4) | Expert disclosure requirements |
| CR 32.01 | Deposition use at trial criteria |
| KRE 803(18) | Learned treatise hearsay exception |
| KRE 804 | Former testimony hearsay exception |
| Miller v. Marymount | Right to use adverse expert's deposition |
