# Trial Preservation for Expert Depositions

## Overview

Expert depositions should be conducted with trial use in mind. This guide covers the procedures to ensure deposition testimony can be used at trial under KRE 804 and CR 32.01.

---

## KRE 804 - Former Testimony Exception

### The Rule

KRE 804(b)(1) allows use of former testimony if:
1. Declarant is **unavailable** as a witness
2. The testimony was given at a prior proceeding
3. The party against whom it's offered (or predecessor) had **similar motive** to develop the testimony

### "Similar Motive" Requirement

**The Problem:** Defense may argue they didn't have "similar motive" at discovery deposition vs. trial.

**The Solution:** KRE 804 Trial Designation Notice

---

## KRE 804 Trial Designation Notice

### What It Is

A written notice sent **before** the deposition stating:
- Intent to use deposition testimony at trial under KRE 804
- Puts defense on notice to examine with trial-like motive
- Neutralizes "similar motive" objection

### Timing

Send **3-5 days before** the deposition.

### Sample Notice Language

```
NOTICE OF INTENT TO USE DEPOSITION AT TRIAL UNDER KRE 804

Please take notice that pursuant to KRE 804(b)(1), Plaintiff intends 
to offer the deposition testimony of [Expert Name] as evidence at 
the trial of this matter.

Defense counsel is hereby placed on notice to conduct examination 
of this witness with the same motive and opportunity as would be 
available at trial. This notice is provided to ensure defense 
counsel cannot later claim lack of "similar motive" under 
KRE 804(b)(1).

This notice supplements the deposition notice served on [date], 
which stated the deposition would be taken "for any and all purposes 
permitted by the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure, including use 
as evidence at the trial in this matter."
```

### Effect

- Creates record that defense was on notice
- Defense cannot claim surprise
- Defense had full opportunity to examine
- Eliminates "similar motive" objection

---

## CR 32.01 - Use of Depositions at Trial

### General Rule

Depositions may be used at trial for:
- Impeachment of any witness
- As admission of party-opponent
- As substantive evidence (if criteria met)

### Use Against Adverse Party

Deposition of a party (or party's officer, director, managing agent) may be used for **any purpose**.

### Use of Expert Deposition

Under CR 32.01(a)(3), deposition may be used if witness is:

| Criterion | Application to Experts |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Witness is dead | Unlikely |
| Witness more than 100 miles away | Common for out-of-state experts |
| Witness unable to attend due to illness, infirmity, imprisonment | Less common |
| Witness cannot be compelled to attend | May apply to out-of-state experts |
| Party unable to procure attendance despite diligence | Document efforts |
| Witness is a practicing physician | **Common - most DME/IME doctors qualify** |

### "Practicing Physician" Exception

CR 32.01 specifically allows use of a **practicing physician's** deposition at trial. This is the most common basis for using defense medical expert depositions.

**Verify at Deposition:**
```
Q. You are currently a practicing physician?
A. Yes.

Q. You maintain an active medical practice?
A. Yes.

Q. You see patients regularly?
A. Yes.
```

## Miller v. Marymount Medical Center

### The Holding

The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the right to call an adverse party's expert witness via deposition at trial.

### Significance

- You can **affirmatively use** defense expert's deposition
- Not limited to impeachment
- Can present favorable testimony from defense expert
- Defense cannot prevent you from using their own expert

### When to Cite

Include reference in trial designation notice or in response to any motion to exclude deposition:

> "The Kentucky Supreme Court has affirmed the right to use an adverse 
> party's expert witness deposition at trial. Miller v. Marymount 
> Medical Center, 125 S.W.3d 274 (Ky. 2004)."

## Deposition Notice Requirements

### Required Trial-Use Language

Include in every expert deposition notice:

```
Said deposition will be taken by stenographic and video methods and 
for any and all purposes permitted by the Kentucky Rules of Civil 
Procedure, including use as evidence at the trial in this matter. 
Said deposition shall be considered ongoing in nature and shall 
continue from day to day until completed, Sundays and holidays excepted.
```

### Why This Matters

1. **"Stenographic and video"** - Preserves maximum evidentiary options
2. **"Any and all purposes"** - Broadest possible use
3. **"Including use as evidence at trial"** - Explicit trial use notice
4. **"Ongoing in nature"** - Prevents premature termination
