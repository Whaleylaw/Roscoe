# Expert Dossier Compilation Guide

## Overview

Before deposing a defense expert, compile a comprehensive dossier to identify conflict opportunities, prior inconsistent statements, and impeachment material.

## Phase 1: Pre-Deposition Discovery

### Step 1.1: Expert Interrogatory (CR 26.02(4))

Serve interrogatory requesting:
- Expert's specific specialty
- Complete list of materials reviewed
- Summary of each opinion with grounds/basis

**Timing:** Serve early in discovery to establish clear disclosure record.

### Step 1.2: Document Request for Expert's File

Request these categories comprehensively:

**File Materials:**
- [ ] Complete copy of all file materials and notes
- [ ] All correspondence between expert and defense counsel
- [ ] All draft reports created
- [ ] Materials obtained from other experts or consultants

**Publications and Authorities:**
- [ ] All publications relied upon
- [ ] Applicable statutes, best practices, or standards
- [ ] Demonstrative exhibits or animations

**Compensation:**
- [ ] Fee agreement
- [ ] Invoices for this case
- [ ] Total compensation received

### Step 1.3: Strategic Timing

**60-Day Rule:**
- Serve RFP at least 60 days before deposition
- This provides: 30-day response + 30-day buffer for motion to compel
- Calendar response deadline and follow-up

### Step 1.4: Privilege Log Interrogatory

Ask:
1. Have any materials been withheld on privilege grounds?
2. If so, provide privilege log with:
   - Each withheld item
   - Date
   - Author(s) and recipient(s)
   - Specific privilege asserted

**Waiver Opportunity:** Failure to provide proper privilege log = potential waiver argument under *Baptist Healthcare v. Goodman*.

## Phase 2: Database and Records Searches

**Document for Each Appearance:**

- Court
- Date of testimony
- Parties
- Expert's role (defense/plaintiff)

### Step 2.2: Publications and Academic Materials

| Source | What to Find |
|--------|--------------|
| PubMed | Peer-reviewed articles |
| JSTOR | Academic articles |
| Google Scholar | Publications, citations |
| Institution repositories | University publications |
| Amazon/Library | Books authored |

**Flag:** Any position that conflicts with anticipated testimony.

### Step 2.3: Professional Records

| Source | What to Find |
|--------|--------------|
| State licensing board | Disciplinary actions, complaints |

|------|-------|------|------|---------------|-----------|
| | | | | | |

**4. Publications Analysis**

| Publication | Date | Key Positions | Conflicts Current Case? |
|-------------|------|---------------|------------------------|
| | | | |

**5. Credibility Issues**
- Disciplinary actions
- Prior exclusions or sanctions
- Controversial statements
- Bias indicators

**6. Digital Presence Summary**

## Phase 4: Discoverability Analysis

### Federal Court (FRCP 26(b)(4))

**Protected:**
- Draft reports (26(b)(4)(B))
- Attorney-expert communications regarding trial prep (26(b)(4)(C))

**Exceptions:** Communications regarding:
- Compensation
- Facts/data provided to expert
- Assumptions counsel asked expert to make

### Kentucky State Court

**Open Question:** Kentucky has not definitively ruled.

**Relevant Cases:**
- *Newsome v. Lowe*: Work-product for consulting expert reports
- *Palmer v. Abedi*: Work-product (not privilege) for draft disclosures

**Strategy:** Push for production in Kentucky courts given lack of clear protection.

### Privilege Log Waiver Arguments

If privilege log deficient or untimely:
- Cite *Baptist Healthcare v. Goodman*
- Argue failure to properly assert = waiver
- Request in camera review if appropriate
