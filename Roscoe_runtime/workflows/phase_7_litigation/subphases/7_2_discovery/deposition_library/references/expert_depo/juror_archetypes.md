# Juror Archetype Targeting for Expert Depositions

## Overview

Based on the AAJ/Wenner-Cusimano research, different juror types respond to different types of conflicts. Target your expert deposition conflicts to the jurors most likely to be on your panel.

## The Three Juror Archetypes

### Tribal Jurors (~30% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Anti-establishment, anti-corporate
- Skeptical of "experts"
- Value common sense over credentials
- Distrust authority figures
- More likely in rural venues, blue-collar areas

**What Persuades Them:**
- Evidence expert is a "hired gun"
- Snap judgments (conclusion before evidence)
- Common sense violations
- "Too good to be true" testimony
- Brief examination vs. treating physician relationship

**Most Effective Conflicts:**
1. Hired gun evidence (compensation, defense-only work)
2. Snap judgment exposure
3. Common sense violations
4. Credential vs. actual effort contradiction

---

### Moderate Jurors (~40% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Trust authority and institutions
- Defer to experts by default
- Believe in "the system"
- Value credentials and formal qualifications
- More likely in suburban areas, professional occupations

**What Persuades Them:**
- Violations of **published** standards
- Contradictions with **authoritative** sources
- Disagreement with **textbooks**
- Prior inconsistent testimony (under oath = serious)
- Expert disagreeing with their own field

**Most Effective Conflicts:**
1. Learned treatise contradictions (KRE 803(18))
2. Prior inconsistent testimony ("squaring up")
3. Violation of published protocols
4. Disagreement with medical literature
5. Failure to follow accepted methodology

---

### Progressive Jurors (~30% of population)

**Characteristics:**
- Pro-science, value data
- Identify with healthcare workers
- Respect expertise and education
- Value methodology and process
- More likely in urban areas, educated demographics

**What Persuades Them:**
- Scientific methodology flaws
- Failure to consider all data
- Cherry-picking favorable findings
- Peer disagreement
- Study limitations not acknowledged

**Most Effective Conflicts:**
1. Methodology criticism
2. Failure to review all records
3. Ignoring contradictory data
4. Lack of peer support for position
5. Overreach beyond expertise

## Conflict Selection by Venue

### Venue Analysis

Before deposition, assess likely jury composition:

| Venue Type | Dominant Archetype | Primary Conflict Focus |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Rural | Tribal | Hired gun, snap judgment |
| Suburban | Moderate | Treatise, prior testimony |
| Urban | Progressive | Methodology, data |

### Mixed Venue Strategy

For venues with mixed demographics:
1. **Always develop**: Hired gun evidence (works for tribals, doesn't hurt with others)
2. **Always develop**: At least one treatise contradiction (convinces moderates)
3. **Layer conflicts**: Build from most universal to most archetype-specific

## Conflict Development by Archetype

### For Tribal Jurors: "Hired Gun" Package

**Questions to Ask:**

```
Q. What are you being paid for your work in this case?
Q. What's your hourly rate?
Q. How many hours have you billed?
Q. What percentage of your income comes from litigation work?
Q. In the last four years, how many times for plaintiffs? Defendants?
Q. Who are your top referral sources?
Q. You make more money when defense lawyers are happy with your work?
```

**Closing Argument Point:**
"This expert makes [X] per year testifying for insurance companies. Who do you think he's trying to help?"

---

### For Moderate Jurors: "Published Standards" Package

**Questions to Ask:**

```
Q. Are you familiar with [Authoritative Text]?
Q. Is it considered authoritative in your field?
Q. [Read contradictory passage]
Q. You gave different testimony in [Prior Case]?
Q. [Read prior testimony]
Q. The accepted protocol is [X]. You didn't do that?
```

**Closing Argument Point:**
"Even the textbooks he says are authoritative disagree with him. His own prior testimony contradicts what he said here."

---

### For Progressive Jurors: "Methodology" Package

**Questions to Ask:**

```
Q. What methodology did you use to reach your conclusions?
Q. Did you review all of the medical records?
Q. Did you consider [contradictory finding]?
Q. Why didn't you perform [standard test]?
Q. Are there peer-reviewed studies supporting your position?
Q. Have you published on this topic?
```

**Closing Argument Point:**
"He didn't follow proper methodology. He ignored data that contradicted his conclusion. That's not science—that's advocacy."

## Building a Complete Conflict Portfolio

### Recommended Distribution

For any expert deposition, develop conflicts targeting all three archetypes:

| Priority | Conflict Type | Target Archetype |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 1 | Hired gun evidence | Tribal |
| 2 | At least one treatise conflict | Moderate |
| 3 | Methodology concern | Progressive |
| 4 | Prior inconsistent testimony | Moderate |
| 5 | Snap judgment | Tribal |
| 6 | Rules of the Road violation | All |

### Sequencing at Deposition

**Opening:** Establish credentials (for later use)

**Early:** Rules of the Road questions (get agreements)

**Middle:** Case-specific opinions and facts

**Middle-Late:** Conflict development (treatise, prior testimony)

**Late:** Compensation and bias

**Closing:** "Any mistakes?" gambit
