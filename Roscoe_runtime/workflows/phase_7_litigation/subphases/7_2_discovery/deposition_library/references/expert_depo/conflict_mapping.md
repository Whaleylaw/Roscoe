# Conflict Mapping for Expert Depositions

## Overview

The goal of expert deposition is to create "conflicts" - contradictions, admissions, and credibility issues that can be exploited at trial. This guide covers the primary conflict creation techniques.

## Conflict Type 1: Rules of the Road

### Concept

Establish general principles the expert cannot deny, then show how the defendant violated those principles.

### Technique

1. Ask about general standards **in a vacuum** (not case-specific)
2. Get agreement to common-sense principles
3. **Then** apply to case facts

### Example Sequence

```
Q. A doctor should take a complete patient history before reaching a diagnosis. 
   Do you agree?
A. Yes.

Q. Including asking about all current symptoms?
A. Yes.

Q. A doctor who fails to take a complete history might miss important information?
A. That's possible.

Q. In this case, Dr. Smith did not ask about [symptom], correct?
A. I'm not sure he did.

Q. So he violated the principle you just agreed to?
```

### Key Elements

- Simple, undeniable principles
- Phrased as mandatory ("should," "must")
- Get agreement before applying to facts
- Creates closing argument foundation

## Conflict Type 2: Squaring Up

### Concept

Confront expert with their own prior testimony that contradicts their current position.

### Technique

1. Establish the prior testimony is authentic
2. Read exact quote into record
3. Ask if testimony was under oath
4. Ask if still their opinion
5. Force reconciliation or contradiction

### Example Sequence

```
Q. You testified in the case of Smith v. Jones in 2022?
A. Yes.

Q. Let me read from page 45, lines 10-15: "[exact quote]"
   Did I read that correctly?
A. Yes.

Q. You were under oath when you gave that testimony?
A. Yes.

Q. Is that still your opinion today?
A. Well, in that case...

Q. My question is: is that still your opinion?
```

### Key Elements

- Use exact verbatim quotes
- Have transcript available as exhibit
- Force yes/no on whether opinion changed
- If changed, explore why

## Conflict Type 3: Snap Judgment Exposure

### Concept

Reveal that expert formed opinion before reviewing all materials, suggesting bias.

### Technique

1. Establish timeline of retention and opinion formation
2. Document what was reviewed at each stage
3. Show opinion locked before key materials reviewed

### Example Sequence

```
Q. When were you first contacted about this case?
A. March 15.

Q. When did you first form an opinion?
A. Probably within a few weeks.

Q. What materials had you reviewed by April 1?
A. The defense summary and some records.

Q. Had you reviewed the treating physician's notes?
A. Not yet.

Q. The MRI report?
A. I don't think so.

Q. But you had formed an opinion?
A. A preliminary one.

Q. When you received those additional materials, did your opinion change?
A. No.

Q. So your opinion was essentially fixed before you saw the key medical evidence?
```

### Key Elements

- Document exact timeline
- Identify what was NOT reviewed initially
- Show opinion didn't change with new information
- Suggests pre-formed conclusion

## Conflict Type 4: Credential Framing

### Concept

Use the expert's own credentials and experience to make their failures more damaging.

### Technique

1. Establish impressive credentials
2. Use credentials to set high expectations
3. Show failure to meet those expectations

### Example Sequence

```
Q. You've been practicing for 30 years?
A. Yes.

Q. You've treated thousands of patients with this condition?
A. Easily.

Q. A doctor with your experience would know that [basic fact], correct?
A. Of course.

Q. Yet in your examination of [Plaintiff], you didn't [basic step]?
A. I didn't think it was necessary.

Q. A doctor with 30 years of experience didn't think [basic step] was necessary?
```

### Key Elements

- Build up credentials first
- Then identify failure to meet own standards
- More damaging from qualified expert than unqualified one

## Conflict Type 5: Ten Questions Method

### Concept

For multiple defense experts, ask identical questions to each and exploit inconsistencies.

### Technique

1. Develop 10 foundational questions capturing case essence
2. Ask **exactly the same questions** to each expert
3. Document responses in matrix
4. Identify and exploit disagreements

### Example Matrix

| Question | Expert 1 | Expert 2 | Expert 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Q1: [Standard X applies] | Agree | Agree | Disagree |
| Q2: [Defendant should have...] | No | Yes | No |
| ... | | | |

### Key Elements

- Questions must be identical
- Track responses carefully
- Exploit: "Your co-expert disagrees with you on this..."

## Conflict Type 6: Learned Treatise Confrontation

### Concept

Use authoritative texts (KRE 803(18)) to contradict expert's opinions.

### Technique

1. Establish treatise is authoritative in field
2. Read passage contradicting expert's opinion
3. Ask expert to reconcile or concede

### Example Sequence

```
Q. Are you familiar with [Authoritative Textbook]?
A. Yes.

Q. Is it considered authoritative in your field?
A. It's well-regarded.

Q. Let me read from page 342: "[passage contradicting expert's opinion]"
   Do you agree with that statement?
A. Not entirely.

Q. So your opinion differs from this authoritative text?
A. I have a different view.

Q. How do you explain that the leading textbook contradicts your opinion?
```

### Key Elements

- Establish authority of text first
- Use exact quotes
- Force explicit disagreement
- Effective with moderate jurors

## Conflict Type 7: Hired Gun Evidence

### Concept

Establish bias through compensation, frequency of defense work, and financial dependence.

### Technique

1. Document total compensation in this case
2. Establish percentage of income from litigation
3. Show pattern of defense-only work
4. Connect income to incentive to please defense

### Key Questions

```
Q. What are you being paid for your work in this case?
Q. What is your hourly rate for deposition testimony?
Q. What is your hourly rate for trial testimony?
Q. Approximately what percentage of your professional income comes from 
   medical-legal work?
Q. In the last four years, how many times have you testified for plaintiffs?
Q. How many times for defendants?
Q. Who are your most frequent referral sources?
```

### Key Elements

- Document specific numbers
- Compare plaintiff vs. defense work
- Calculate effective hourly rate
- Most effective with tribal jurors

## Conflict Mapping Template

For each identified conflict:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| Conflict Type | [Which of the 7 types] |
| Specific Conflict | [What is the contradiction/issue] |
| Source | [Prior testimony/treatise/document] |
| Exact Quote/Citation | [Verbatim with page:line] |
| Target Juror Archetype | [Tribal/Moderate/Progressive] |
| Question Sequence | [Draft questions to establish conflict] |
| Exhibit Needed | [What document to mark] |

---

## Priority Ranking

Rank conflicts by likely impact:

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| High | Direct contradiction of current testimony |
| High | Violation of admitted principles |
| Medium | Methodology concerns |
| Medium | Bias indicators |
| Lower | Minor inconsistencies |
