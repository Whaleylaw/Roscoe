## Priority by Scenario

### Liability Denied - Focus On:
1. Police report (citations, fault indicators)
2. Witness statements
3. Physical evidence (skid marks, damage photos)

### Comparative Fault - Focus On:
1. Evidence showing client's actions were reasonable
2. Evidence of at-fault party's violations
3. Expert opinion if complex

### Word vs Word - Focus On:
1. Independent witness statements
2. Video/camera footage
3. Physical evidence consistent with client's account

## Timeline Considerations

| Evidence Type | Preservation Window |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Traffic camera | 30-90 days typically |
| Business surveillance | 7-30 days typically |
| Witness memory | Degrades over time |
| Physical scene evidence | May change quickly |
| Vehicle damage | Before repairs |

**Act quickly** - request preservation letters for any footage that may be overwritten.
