## Agent Instructions

### Required Language

The following language MUST appear in all defense expert deposition notices:

> "Said deposition will be taken by stenographic and video methods and for any and all purposes permitted by the Kentucky Rules of Civil Procedure, including use as evidence at the trial in this matter. Said deposition shall be considered ongoing in nature and shall continue from day to day until completed, Sundays and holidays excepted."

### KRE 804 Notice

For experts who may not appear at trial (e.g., out-of-state, busy practice), send a separate **KRE 804 Trial Designation Notice** 3-5 days before the deposition. This notice:
- States intent to use deposition testimony at trial under KRE 804
- Puts defense on notice to examine with trial-like motive
- Neutralizes "similar motive" objections

### Strategic Timing

- Serve **RFP to expert** at least 60 days before deposition
- This allows: 30-day response + 30-day buffer for motion to compel
- Serve deposition notice per CR 30.02(1) reasonable notice requirements
