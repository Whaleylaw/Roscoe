## Agent Instructions

### Topic Drafting Requirements

Each topic must meet the "reasonable particularity" standard under CR 30.02(6):

1. **Specific enough** that the corporation can identify the scope of inquiry
2. **Clear enough** that the corporation can select an appropriate witness
3. **Defined enough** that the corporation can adequately prepare the witness

### Topic Template Examples

**Document/Policy Identification:**
```
"Defendant's policies, procedures, and/or practices related to [SUBJECT] 
during the time period from [START DATE] to [END DATE]."
```

**ESI/Electronic Data:**
```
"All email systems used by Defendant from [START DATE] to [END DATE], 
including software, retention policies, and search methodology."
```

**Incident-Related:**
```
"All facts known to Defendant concerning the incident on [DATE], 
including investigations conducted and conclusions reached."
```

**Training and Supervision:**
```
"The training provided to [EMPLOYEE TYPE] regarding [SUBJECT] 
in effect on [DATE]."
```

### Avoid These Pitfalls

- ❌ "All information about X" (too broad)
- ❌ Topics without date ranges (overbroad)
- ❌ Asking for legal conclusions
- ❌ Seeking privileged information
