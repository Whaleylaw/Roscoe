<!-- AGENT: Include if sidewalk defect - KRS 411.110 notice -->
7. Appropriate statutory notice was timely provided to the City of Louisville of this dangerous condition pursuant to KRS 411.110.

### FACTS

8. On or about [incident.date], Plaintiff was lawfully present at [incident.location] in Louisville, Kentucky.

<!-- AGENT: Describe the dangerous condition -->
9. [AGENT: Describe the dangerous condition - e.g., "The sidewalk was grossly defective and uneven, with a raised section creating a tripping hazard," "The public walkway had a dangerous hole/crack," etc.]

<!-- AGENT: Describe the injury -->
10. [AGENT: Describe how the injury occurred]

11. Plaintiff's damages far exceed the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

### COUNT I: NEGLIGENCE

12. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 11 as if fully set forth herein.

13. Defendants, jointly and individually, were negligent, by and through their employees, agents, and assigns, acting in their individual and/or official capacities, in performing ministerial acts assigned to them including but not limited to:

    a. Failing to perform routine maintenance, inspection, and repair of potentially dangerous conditions;
    
    b. Failing to have in place appropriate policies and procedures for sidewalks, curbs, and roadways;
    
    c. Failing to inspect the premises for dangerous conditions;
    
    d. Failing to remedy known dangerous conditions within a reasonable time;
    
    e. Failing to warn the public of dangerous conditions;
    
    f. Other ministerial duties, all of which resulted in a significantly dangerous condition for individuals including the Plaintiff.

14. Defendants, jointly and individually, were per se negligent in violating the Codes and Manuals established by and to be enforced by the Defendants. Pursuant to the Louisville Metro Complete Streets Manual, "Sidewalks, shared-use paths, street crossings (including over- and undercrossings), pedestrian signals, signs, street furniture, transit stops and facilities, and all connecting pathways shall be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so that all pedestrians, including people with disabilities, can travel safely and independently."

15. Said Defendants' joint and/or individual negligence, through the actions and inactions of their employees, agents, and assigns, acting ministerially in their individual and/or official capacities, equated to negligence per se, as well as gross and wanton negligence, which could not be anticipated by Plaintiff and was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injury.

16. Said Defendants knew or should have known of the dangerous condition and failed to inspect and warn the public of the dangerous condition, which was a direct and proximate cause of Plaintiff's injury.

17. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants' negligence, Plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer:

    a. Temporary and permanent bodily injuries;
    
    b. Past and future medical expenses;
    
    c. Past and future wage loss;
    
    d. Past and future pain and suffering;
    
    e. Loss of enjoyment of life;
    
    All in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this Court.

---

## WHEREFORE

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests as follows:

1. Compensatory damages for past and future medical bills, past and future wage loss, past and future pain and suffering, against the Defendants jointly and/or individually, all in an amount in excess of the jurisdictional limits of this Court;

2. Compensatory and Exemplary damages against Defendants jointly and/or individually;

3. Costs of this action;

4. Trial by jury on all issues so triable; and

5. Any and all other damages to which Plaintiff may appear entitled.

Respectfully submitted,
