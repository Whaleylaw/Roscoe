basis for such dispute. If you dispute them with a qualified expert opinion from 
a doctor willing to testify, then please provide us with a copy of his or her report. 
If not, please confirm in writing that you dispute the bills as an adjuster and not 
a qualified medical professional. If you do not respond in writing to this report, 
we will assume you do not dispute the amount of medical bills.

## Future Medical Expenses

<!-- 
Optional section - include only if there's documented future care needs.
If client will need ongoing treatment, include projection.
Base on physician recommendations or life care plan.
-->

[Client] continues to experience pain and symptomatology as a result of the injuries

including, but not limited to, [type of care]. A conservative estimate of future medical 
care for [Client] is **$[AMOUNT]**.

<!-- If you have a detailed projection table: -->
| Procedure | Years | #/Year | Cost | Total |

of the incident, [Client] earned [hourly rate/salary] as a [job title]. [He/She] has 
[not been able to return/returned to work on X date] since the [DATE] incident.

<!-- Show calculation if applicable -->

## Loss of Household Services

The injuries that [Client] sustained on [DATE] caused [him/her] a great deal of 
physical and emotional pain and suffering. As a result of your insured's negligence, 
[Client] suffered serious injuries that affected [his/her] entire life. [Client] 
experienced difficulty and pain when trying to complete simple daily activities that 
[he/she] used to be able to complete with ease prior to this incident.

[Continue with specific impacts: unable to exercise, sleep disruption, difficulty 
caring for children, emotional distress, strain on relationships, etc.]

To this day, [Client] continues to experience residual symptoms from [his/her] injuries. 
As [his/her] injuries interfered with [his/her] physical abilities, [he/she] was unjustly 
imposed with a direct impediment that significantly impacted [his/her] ability to go about

mentally.
