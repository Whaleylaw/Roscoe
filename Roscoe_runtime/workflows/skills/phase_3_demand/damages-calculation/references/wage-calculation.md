# Lost Wage Calculation Guide

## Required Documentation

Before calculating lost wages, gather:

| Document | Source | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Off-work notes | Medical records | Physician authorization |
| Pay stubs | Client (3-6 months pre-accident) | Income verification |
| W-2 or tax returns | Client | Annual income verification |
| Employer letter | Employer HR/supervisor | Confirm dates missed |

## Calculation Methods

### Method 1: Hourly Employees

**Formula**:
```
Daily Rate = Hourly Rate × Hours per Day
Weekly Rate = Hourly Rate × Hours per Week
Lost Wages = Days Missed × Daily Rate
```

**Example**:
```
Hourly Rate: $20.00
Hours per Day: 8
Daily Rate: $160.00
Days Missed: 30

Lost Wages: 30 × $160 = $4,800.00
```

### Method 2: Salaried Employees

**Formula**:
```
Daily Rate = Annual Salary / 260 working days
   OR
Daily Rate = (Annual Salary / 52 weeks) / 5 days

Lost Wages = Days Missed × Daily Rate
```

**Example**:
```
Annual Salary: $65,000
Daily Rate: $65,000 / 260 = $250.00
Days Missed: 45

Lost Wages: 45 × $250 = $11,250.00
```

### Method 3: Self-Employed

**Documentation Needed**:
- Tax returns (Schedule C or business return)
- Bank statements
- Lost contracts/jobs documentation

**Calculation**:
```
Average Daily Income = (Previous Year Net Income) / 365
   OR
Lost Contracts = Sum of documented lost opportunities
```
