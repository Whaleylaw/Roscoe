## Fee Agreement Verification

**ALWAYS check the actual fee agreement for:**
- Specific percentage(s)
- Staged or sliding scale rates
- Any modifications or addenda
- Special provisions

### Common Fee Structures

**Flat Rate:**
```
Fee = Gross × [Agreed Percentage]
```

**Staged Rate:**
```
If settled before filing: 33.33%
If settled after filing but before trial: 40%
If settled during/after trial: 45%
```

**Sliding Scale:**
```
First $100,000: 33.33%
$100,001 - $500,000: 30%
Over $500,000: 25%
```

---

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Pre-Litigation

```
Settlement: $50,000
Rate: 33.33%

Fee = $50,000 × 0.3333 = $16,665
```

### Example 2: Standard Post-Litigation

```
Settlement: $150,000
Rate: 40%

Fee = $150,000 × 0.40 = $60,000
```

### Example 3: Staged Rate

```
Settlement: $75,000
Complaint filed: Yes
Trial: No

Rate applies: 40%
Fee = $75,000 × 0.40 = $30,000
```

### Example 4: Sliding Scale

```
Settlement: $200,000
Rate structure:
  - First $100K at 33.33%
  - Next $100K at 30%

Fee = ($100,000 × 0.3333) + ($100,000 × 0.30)
Fee = $33,333 + $30,000 = $63,333
```

---

## Multiple Claim Settlements

### Single Carrier, Multiple Claims

When BI and UM settled together:
```
BI Settlement: $50,000
UM Settlement: $25,000
Total: $75,000

Fee = $75,000 × [rate] = Total fee
```

### Multiple Carriers

When settled with multiple insurers:
```
Carrier A (BI): $50,000 @ 33.33% = $16,665
Carrier B (UM): $25,000 @ 40% = $10,000
Total Fee: $26,665
```

**Note:** Different claims may have different litigation status and thus different rates.

---

## Referral Fee Splits

If case was referred:

### Standard Split
```
Total Fee: $30,000
Referring attorney: 33.33% = $10,000
Handling attorney: 66.67% = $20,000
```

### Other Splits
- 25/75
- 40/60
- Per written agreement

**Document the split agreement and ensure client approved.**

---

## Costs vs. Fees

| Type | Treatment |
|------|-----------|
| Attorney Fee | Percentage of gross |
| Case Costs | Separate reimbursement from gross |

**Costs are NOT calculated as percentage.**

```
Gross Settlement:         $100,000
Less Attorney Fee (33%): -$33,333
Less Case Costs:          -$5,000
Available for liens/client: $61,667
```

---

## Fee on Liens

**Kentucky Rule:**
- Fee typically calculated on gross settlement
- NOT reduced by lien amounts

**Some states/agreements:**
- Allow fee on net (after liens)
- Check specific agreement

---

## Documentation Required

For each settlement:
- [ ] Original fee agreement
- [ ] Any modifications
- [ ] Referral agreement (if applicable)
- [ ] Fee calculation worksheet
- [ ] Client approval of distribution

---

## Ethical Considerations

Kentucky KRPC 1.5:
- Fee must be reasonable
- Must be in writing
- Client must understand
- Contingency agreements require specific disclosures

**Always verify fee reasonableness and client understanding before distribution.**
