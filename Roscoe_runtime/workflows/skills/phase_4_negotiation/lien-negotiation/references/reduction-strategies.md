## Medicare Lien Reduction

### Legal Framework

- Medicare Secondary Payer Act (42 U.S.C. § 1395y(b))
- Medicare is always entitled to reimbursement
- BUT entitled to reduction for procurement costs

### Procurement Cost Argument

**Formula:**
```
Reduction = Attorney Fee Percentage + (Costs / Recovery)

Example:
- Recovery: $100,000
- Attorney Fee: 33.33%
- Costs: $5,000 (5%)
- Procurement Cost: 38.33%

Medicare Lien: $20,000
Reduced Amount: $20,000 × (1 - 0.3833) = $12,334
```

### Process

1. **Obtain Final Demand**
   - Contact MSPRC: 1-855-798-2627
   - Request final conditional payment amount
   - Dispute unrelated charges in writing

2. **Challenge Unrelated Items**
   - Review each charge
   - Identify pre-existing or unrelated treatment
   - Submit documentation with dispute

3. **Request Reduction**
   - Submit settlement information
   - Provide fee agreement
   - Request procurement cost reduction

### Timeline

- Request final demand: 2-4 weeks
- Dispute resolution: 4-8 weeks
- Final agreement: 2-4 weeks

## Medicaid Lien Reduction

### Legal Framework

- State law controls
- Kentucky: KRS 205.608
- Must satisfy before distribution

### Kentucky-Specific Rules

**Formula-Based Reduction:**
```
Kentucky allows reduction based on attorney fees and costs
Reduction = (Lien × Recovery) / Total Damages

If recovery is less than damages claimed, 
lien is reduced proportionally.
```

### Process

1. **Obtain Lien Amount**
   - Contact Kentucky Medicaid Third Party Liability
   - Request itemized statement

2. **Challenge Unrelated Charges**
   - Review for pre-existing conditions
   - Document accident-related treatment only

3. **Apply Reduction Formula**
   - Calculate per KRS 205.608
   - Submit settlement details
   - Request written reduction agreement

## ERISA Plan Subrogation

### Legal Framework

- Federal ERISA preempts state law
- Plan language controls rights
- But equitable defenses may apply

### Key Arguments

**Make Whole Doctrine:**
- If plan is silent on subrogation
- Client must be "made whole" first
- Plan gets remainder, if any

**Common Fund Doctrine:**
- Plan must share in attorney fees
- Typically 1/3 reduction
- Plan benefited from legal work

**Equitable Defenses:**
- Plan didn't help with recovery
- Reduction is fair and equitable

### Process

1. **Obtain Plan Documents**
   - Request Summary Plan Description (SPD)
   - Request full plan document
   - Review subrogation language

2. **Analyze Plan Language**
   - Does it address attorney fees?
   - Does it require "make whole"?
   - Is language ambiguous?

3. **Negotiate**
   - Start at 50% reduction
   - Cite case law supporting arguments
   - Be prepared to compromise at 30-40%

### Key Cases to Cite

- *US Airways v. McCutchen*, 569 U.S. 88 (2013)
- *Sereboff v. Mid Atlantic Medical*, 547 U.S. 356 (2006)

## Hospital Statutory Liens

### Legal Framework

- Kentucky: KRS 205.715
- Hospital lien attaches to recovery
- Limited to hospital charges only

### Negotiation Approach

**Arguments for Reduction:**

1. **Limited Recovery Available**
   - "Settlement limited by policy limits"
   - "Client's net recovery insufficient"

2. **Proportionate Reduction**
   - All creditors taking reduction
   - Fair distribution argument

3. **Relationship Maintenance**
   - Future referrals possible
   - Goodwill consideration

### Process

1. **Verify Lien Validity**
   - Properly filed?
   - Timely perfected?
   - Accurate amount?

2. **Request Reduction**
   - Send reduction request letter
   - Explain settlement circumstances
   - Propose specific reduction (30-50%)

3. **Negotiate**
   - Hospital counsel usually authorized
   - Start high, expect compromise
   - Get written agreement

### Sample Request Language

```
"Given the limited settlement recovery and our client's 
significant outstanding medical obligations, we respectfully 
request that [Hospital] accept $X in full satisfaction of 
its $Y lien, representing a [Z]% reduction."
```

## Provider Liens (Contractual)

### Overview

- Based on contract with client
- Most flexible to negotiate
- Often deeply reduced or waived

### Leverage Points

1. **No Recovery, No Pay**
   - Many providers signed LOP
   - They agreed to wait for settlement
   - They assume collection risk

2. **Goodwill**
   - Provider wants referrals
   - Maintaining relationship matters

3. **Partial Payment Now**
   - Better than waiting for Medicare/Medicaid
   - Certainty of payment

### Reduction Expectations

| Provider Type | Typical Reduction |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Chiropractor | 40-60% |
| Physical Therapy | 30-50% |
| Imaging Center | 30-50% |
| Specialist | 20-40% |
| Primary Care | 20-40% |

### Process

1. **Compile Provider List**
   - Total each provider's balance
   - Note any LOP agreements

2. **Make Initial Offers**
   - Start at 40-50% of balance
   - Emphasize prompt payment
   - Note limited recovery

3. **Negotiate as Needed**
   - Most providers counteroffer
   - Expect final 60-70% of original
   - Get releases in writing

## Documentation Requirements

### For All Lien Reductions

Record:
- Original lien amount
- Reduction negotiated
- Final payment amount
- Date of agreement
- Authorization/release obtained

### Settlement Statement

Include in final accounting:
```
Lien Resolutions:
  Medicare (original $15,000)     $10,500
  ERISA Plan (original $8,000)     $5,000
  Hospital (original $12,000)      $8,000
  Providers (original $10,000)     $6,000
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Liens (reduced from $45,000): $29,500
  Savings from Negotiation: $15,500
```

## Timeline Summary

| Lien Type | Typical Resolution Time |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Medicare | 4-12 weeks |
| Medicaid | 2-6 weeks |
| ERISA | 2-8 weeks |
| Hospital | 2-4 weeks |
