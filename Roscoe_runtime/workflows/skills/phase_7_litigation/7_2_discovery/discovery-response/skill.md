# Discovery Response Skill

## Overview

Prepare complete, timely responses to defendant's discovery requests while protecting privileged information.

## When to Use

Use when:
- Responding to interrogatories
- Responding to requests for production
- Responding to requests for admission
- Need to assert objections

DO NOT use if:
- Propounding discovery (use discovery-drafting skill)
- Responding to subpoena (different process)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Review Each Request

For each request, determine:
- Is it objectionable?
- What information is required?
- Are documents responsive?

### Step 2: Identify Valid Objections

Common objections:
- Vague and ambiguous
- Overly broad
- Unduly burdensome
- Privileged

**See:** `references/common-objections.md` for objection language.

### Step 3: Draft Responses

- Answer fully subject to objections
- "Subject to and without waiving" objections
- Don't volunteer extra information

### Step 4: Prepare Privilege Log

If withholding documents on privilege:
- Document date, author, recipient
- Nature of document
- Privilege claimed

**See:** `references/privilege-log.md` for format.

## Output Format

```markdown
## Response to [Discovery Type]

**From:** [Defendant Name]
**Received:** [Date]
**Response Due:** [Date]
**Served:** [Date]

### Response to Request No. [X]
[Objection if any]
