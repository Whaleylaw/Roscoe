# Deposition Preparation Checklist

## The Five Fundamental Rules

### Rule 1: Listen to the Entire Question

**Tell the client:**
- Wait for the complete question before answering
- Make sure you understand what is being asked
- Ask for clarification if unclear
- Don't anticipate where the question is going

**Practice:**
- Ask long questions, see if client waits
- Ask unclear questions, see if client asks for clarification

---

### Rule 2: Answer Only What Is Asked

**Tell the client:**
- A "yes" or "no" is a complete answer
- Don't volunteer additional information
- Don't explain your answer unless asked
- Don't try to convince the other lawyer

**Examples:**
```
Q: Were you injured in the accident?
A: Yes. [NOT: "Yes, my neck was killing me and I couldn't 
   sleep for weeks..."]

Q: What color was the light?
A: Green. [NOT: "Green, and I always stop for red lights, 
   I'm a very careful driver..."]
```

### Rule 3: Tell the Truth

**Tell the client:**
- Always tell the truth - they're under oath
- If you don't know, say "I don't know"
- If you don't remember, say "I don't remember"
- Don't guess or estimate unless asked to
- It's okay to say you don't know

**Practice:**
- Ask questions where answer is unknown
- See if client guesses vs. admits not knowing

---

### Rule 4: Take Your Time

**Tell the client:**
- There's no rush
- Pause before answering to think
- It's okay to think before speaking
- The transcript doesn't show pauses
- If you need a break, ask for one

### Rule 5: Watch for Tricks

**Common tricks to warn about:**

| Trick | How to Handle |
|-------|---------------|
| Leading questions | Answer only what you know |
| "Isn't it true that..." | Don't agree just because asked |
| Compound questions | Ask them to break it up |
| Assumes facts | Correct the assumption |
| "Always" / "Never" | Rarely true - qualify |
| Summarizing wrong | Correct the summary |
