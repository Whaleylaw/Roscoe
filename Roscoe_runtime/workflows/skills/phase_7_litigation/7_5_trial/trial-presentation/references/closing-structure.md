## Standard PI Closing Structure

### 1. Introduction (2-3 minutes)

Return to theme:
```
"Members of the jury, when we started this case I told 
you it was about [theme]. The evidence has proven that."
```

### 2. Review the Evidence (10-15 minutes)

Walk through key evidence:
- Liability facts
- Injury evidence
- Damage proof

**Be specific:**
```
"You heard [Witness] testify that [specific testimony]. 
You saw Exhibit [X] which shows [specific evidence]."
```

### 3. Apply the Law (5-10 minutes)

Connect evidence to instructions:
```
"The Judge will instruct you that negligence is [definition]. 
The evidence shows defendant was negligent because [facts]."
```

Address each element:
- Duty
- Breach
- Causation
- Damages

### 4. Address Weaknesses (3-5 minutes)

Don't ignore problems:
```
"Defense counsel will tell you [weakness]. Here's why 
that doesn't change the result: [explanation]."
```

### 5. Damages (5-10 minutes)

Be specific and justify:
```
"Medical bills: $[X]. Every penny documented. You've 
seen every bill.

Lost wages: $[X]. [Employer] confirmed the time missed.

Pain and suffering: This is where your judgment comes in. 
[Client] has suffered [specific suffering] for [duration]. 
What is that worth? I suggest $[X] is fair because [reason]."
```

### 6. Conclusion (2-3 minutes)

Clear request:
```
"I ask you to return a verdict of $[total] to fully 
compensate [Client] for all the harm caused by the 
defendant's negligence. That is justice. That is what 
the evidence demands. Thank you."
```

## Damages Argument Techniques

### Per Diem

```
"That's [X] days of pain. If you value each day at $[Y], 
that's $[total]."
```

### Multiplier

```
"Medical bills are $[X]. The injuries justify [multiplier] 
times that for pain and suffering."
```

### Anchoring

```
"What would you pay to avoid [specific suffering]? 
$[X]? $[Y]? That's what [Client] is entitled to."
```
