## Response Tactics

### Bracketing

**How it works:**
- Identify defense offer and your target
- Propose range that includes your target as midpoint
- Example: Defense at $100K, target $300K → Demand $500K

**Communication:**
```
"If you can get them to $200K, I can work with my client 
to move to $400K. We can work toward a number in the middle."
```

### Splitting the Difference

**When to use:** Close to resolution, need final push.

**Caution:** Don't suggest too early.

### Conditional Moves

**How it works:**
```
"I'll move to $X if they move to $Y."
```

**Purpose:** Creates momentum, tests other side's flexibility.

## Impasse-Breaking Tactics

### Mediator's Proposal

**How it works:**
1. Mediator develops number they believe will settle case
2. Both sides accept or reject confidentially
3. If both accept → Settlement
4. If either rejects → No one knows who rejected

**When to suggest:** Parties close but stuck.

### New Information

**Approach:** Share something defendant didn't know:
- New medical development
- Strong witness
- Comparable verdict research

### Take a Break

**When to use:**
- Emotions running high
- Client needs to think
- Strategy needs adjustment

### Focus on Interests

**Move from positions to interests:**
- What does defendant really need? (Closure, confidentiality, payment terms)
- What does client really need? (Money, acknowledgment, certainty)

## Client Management

### Keeping Client Engaged

- Regular updates during caucuses
- Explain what's happening
- Involve in decisions

### Managing Expectations

- Remind of case weaknesses
- Show net-to-client calculations
- Discuss trial risks and costs

### Getting Authority to Move

**Questions to ask client:**
- "If they came to $X, would you settle?"
- "What's more important: X amount or certainty?"
- "Do you want to risk trial for the difference?"

## Defense Tactics to Anticipate

| Tactic | Response |
|--------|----------|
| Lowball opening | Don't overreact; steady progress more important |
| "Take it or leave it" | Usually not true; call the bluff |
| Delay/stall | Ask mediator to push |
| Attack plaintiff | Stay calm; focus on facts |
| Claim no authority | Should have been confirmed pre-mediation |

## Post-Impasse Options

If mediation fails:

1. **Leave door open**: "We're $X apart. If your client moves, call me."
2. **Schedule follow-up**: Another session in 30 days
3. **Mediator's proposal**: Try after cooling off
4. **Proceed to trial**: Sometimes necessary to get fair value
