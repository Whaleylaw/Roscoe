## Search Strategy

### Step 1: Define Search Terms

For a cervical disc herniation case:
```
"cervical herniation" OR "cervical disc" OR "neck injury"
AND
"motor vehicle" OR "car accident" OR "rear-end collision"
AND
Kentucky OR Jefferson OR Louisville
```

### Step 2: Filter Results

- Date range: Last 5-10 years
- Verdict range: $X to $Y
- Case type: Personal injury
- Exclude outliers

### Step 3: Analyze Results

For each comparable, note:
- Case name/citation
- Verdict/settlement amount
- Injury description
- Special damages amount
- Liability situation
- Trial vs. settlement

## Comparison Framework

### Create Comparison Table

| Factor | Our Case | Comparable 1 | Comparable 2 |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Injury | Cervical herniation | Cervical herniation | Lumbar herniation |
| Surgery | No | No | Yes |
| Specials | $25,000 | $22,000 | $45,000 |
| Verdict | ? | $85,000 | $150,000 |
| Venue | Jefferson | Jefferson | Fayette |

### Calculate Multipliers

```
Comparable 1 Multiplier = $85,000 / $22,000 = 3.86×
Comparable 2 Multiplier = $150,000 / $45,000 = 3.33×
Average Multiplier = 3.6×

Our Case Estimate = $25,000 × 3.6 = $90,000
```
