## Counter-Offer Fundamentals

### Purpose of Counter-Offer

1. Reject their current offer
2. State your new position
3. Justify the counter amount
4. Move toward resolution
5. Maintain leverage

### Key Elements

Every counter should include:
- Acknowledgment of their offer
- Clear statement of counter amount
- Justification for your position
- Call to action / timeline

## Calculating Counter Amount

### First Counter (After Their First Offer)

**Rule of Thumb:**
- If offer < 25% of demand: Counter at 85-90% of demand
- If offer 25-40% of demand: Counter at 75-85% of demand
- If offer 40-60% of demand: Counter at 65-75% of demand
- If offer > 60% of demand: Evaluate for acceptance

### Subsequent Counters

**Decreasing Movement Pattern:**

| Round | Your Movement | Their Expected Movement |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|
| 2 | 10-15% reduction | 20-30% increase |
| 3 | 8-12% reduction | 15-25% increase |
| 4 | 5-8% reduction | 10-15% increase |
| 5+ | 2-5% or final | Converging |

### Example Calculation

```
Demand: $100,000
Their Offer: $20,000 (20% of demand)

Analysis: Very low offer, counter strongly

Counter: $85,000 (15% reduction from demand)
Movement: $15,000

Justification: "While we've reduced our demand to show 
good faith, we cannot accept less than this given the 
documented $30,000 in medical expenses and clear liability."
```

## Counter-Offer Letter Structure

### Format

```
RE: [Client Name] v. [Defendant]
    Claim No: [Number]
    Date of Loss: [Date]

Dear [Adjuster]:

[Opening - acknowledge their offer]

[Body - justify your position]

[Counter statement]

[Call to action]

[Closing]
```

### Section Details

**Opening:**
> "Thank you for your offer of $25,000 dated [date] on behalf of [insured]. While we appreciate the movement from your initial position, this offer remains insufficient to resolve our client's claim."

**Body (Justification):**
> "As detailed in our demand, our client sustained [injuries] requiring [treatment]. Medical expenses total $X, and treatment is [ongoing/complete]. Liability is clear as evidenced by [police report/admission/etc.]."
>
> "Recent verdicts in [venue] for similar injuries support a case value of $X to $Y. See [case citations if available]."

**Counter Statement:**
> "After careful consideration with our client, we are prepared to resolve this matter for $65,000. This represents a $20,000 reduction from our demand and reflects [reason for reduction]."

**Call to Action:**
> "Please respond within [timeframe]. If we cannot reach resolution, we will proceed with filing a lawsuit."

## Situation-Specific Counters

### Low First Offer Counter

**Situation:** Their offer is < 25% of demand

**Strategy:**
- Counter at 85-90% of demand
- Emphasize case strength
- Request explanation for their low offer
- Signal willingness to litigate

**Sample Language:**
> "Your offer of $15,000 represents only 15% of our demand and fails to cover even our client's documented medical expenses. We are at a loss to understand the basis for such an offer given the clear liability established by the police report. Please explain your valuation. In the meantime, we counter at $90,000."

### Stalled Negotiation Counter

**Situation:** Minimal movement over multiple rounds

**Strategy:**
- Provide new information
- Suggest specific settlement range
- Offer to discuss directly
- Mention litigation preparation

**Sample Language:**
> "We have now exchanged [N] offers without meaningful progress. Your current position of $35,000 remains far from any reasonable settlement range. To break this impasse, we are prepared to recommend settlement to our client at $55,000 if you can meet that number. Please consider this carefully, as we are preparing a complaint for filing."

### Near-Settlement Counter

**Situation:** Gap is small, settlement in sight

**Strategy:**
- Make modest final movement
- Use specific (odd) number
- Indicate this is final
- Facilitate quick resolution

**Sample Language:**
> "After consulting with our client, we are prepared to resolve this claim for $47,500, representing our final position. This accounts for [specific justification]. Please confirm acceptance by [date] so we can prepare settlement documents."

## Counter Justification Strategies

### Economic Arguments

- Medical expenses documented at $X
- Lost wages calculated at $Y
- Future medical estimated at $Z
- Economic loss totals $X+Y+Z minimum

### Legal Arguments

- Liability is clear (police report, admission, etc.)
- Damages are documented and supported
- Venue is favorable for plaintiff
- Similar cases resulted in [verdicts]

### Practical Arguments

- Client is prepared to litigate
- Litigation costs exceed settlement gap
- Quick resolution benefits all parties
- Reasonable position deserves reasonable response

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Countering Too Low

**Problem:** Large early concession signals weakness
**Solution:** Move moderately, especially early

### Countering Without Justification

**Problem:** Arbitrary numbers lack persuasion
**Solution:** Always explain why this is your number

### Countering Too Quickly

**Problem:** Appears desperate or unprepared
**Solution:** Take time to "consider" even if you know your counter

### Splitting Too Early

**Problem:** Leaves money on table
**Solution:** Reserve split for closing stages only

### Revealing Bottom Line

**Problem:** Eliminates negotiating room
**Solution:** Never state your true minimum
