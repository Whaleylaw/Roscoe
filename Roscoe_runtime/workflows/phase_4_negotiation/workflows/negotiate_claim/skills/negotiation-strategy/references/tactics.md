# Negotiation Tactics

## Overview

This reference provides detailed negotiation tactics for personal injury settlement discussions. Understanding these techniques helps maximize client recovery.

---

## Core Negotiation Principles

### 1. Preparation is Everything

Before any negotiation:
- Know your case value (high, low, likely)
- Understand their position/constraints
- Have documentation ready
- Know your BATNA (Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement)

### 2. Information is Power

- Never reveal true bottom line
- Ask questions to understand their position
- Listen more than talk
- Document everything

### 3. Patience Wins

- Don't rush to settle
- Time often works in plaintiff's favor
- Insurance companies have settlement budgets/timelines

---

## Anchoring

### Concept

The first number mentioned heavily influences negotiation outcome. Higher anchors lead to higher settlements.

### Application

**Our Demand (High Anchor):**
- Start with justified but aspirational demand
- Support with documentation
- Creates negotiating room

**Their Offer (Low Anchor):**
- Recognize it as strategic
- Don't accept premise
- Counter based on case value, not their anchor

### Example

```
Our Demand: $100,000 (anchors high)
Their First Offer: $15,000 (anchors low)
Psychological Midpoint: $57,500

Without anchoring awareness, parties drift toward $57,500.
With anchoring awareness, we can pull settlement higher.
```

## Bracketing

### Concept

Each pair of offers creates a bracket suggesting eventual settlement zone.

### Tracking Brackets

| Round | Their Offer | Our Counter | Bracket Midpoint |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | $15,000 | $85,000 | $50,000 |
| 2 | $25,000 | $70,000 | $47,500 |
| 3 | $35,000 | $55,000 | $45,000 |

### Strategic Use

- Watch for their implied bracket
- Control midpoint movement
- Use to predict settlement range

## Concession Patterns

### Concept

How you make concessions signals your flexibility and final position.

### Decreasing Concessions Pattern

| Round | Concession | Signal |
|-------|------------|--------|
| 1 | $15,000 | "Room to negotiate" |
| 2 | $10,000 | "Moving toward position" |
| 3 | $5,000 | "Getting close to limit" |
| 4 | $2,000 | "Near final number" |

### What Concessions Signal

**Large Concession:**
- "I have more room"
- "I'm flexible"
- "Keep negotiating"

**Small Concession:**
- "I'm near my limit"
- "This is getting serious"
- "Final number approaching"

**No Concession:**
- "This is my position"
- "Take it or leave it"
- (Use sparingly)

## Response Strategies

### To Lowball Offers

**Don't:**
- React emotionally
- Make large counter-concession
- Accept their framing

**Do:**
- Acknowledge receipt calmly
- Question their analysis
- Restate case value
- Counter strongly

**Sample Response:**
> "I've received your offer of $15,000. Given that medical specials alone are $25,000, and liability is clear per the police report, I'm having difficulty understanding the basis for this offer. My client is prepared to resolve this matter for $85,000."

### To "Final Offer" Claims

**Reality Check:**
- First "final offer" rarely is final
- Insurance adjusters have authority ranges
- Supervisors can approve more

**Response:**
- Acknowledge their position
- Provide new information or argument
- Request supervisor review if appropriate

### To No Response

**Follow-Up Schedule:**
- 1 week: Email check-in
- 2 weeks: Phone call
- 3 weeks: Letter to supervisor
- 4 weeks: Evaluate litigation

---

## Communication Techniques

### Framing

Present information favorably:

**Weak:** "We'd accept $50,000"
**Strong:** "Given the documented $25,000 in medical expenses and our client's ongoing symptoms, $50,000 represents a significant concession from our supported demand."

### Justification

Always justify your position:

**Weak:** "Our counter is $70,000"
**Strong:** "Based on comparable verdicts in Jefferson County for similar cervical injuries, we are countering at $70,000, which reflects a 30% reduction from our demand in recognition of [specific factor]."

### Silence

Strategic silence:
- After stating position, wait
- Let them fill the silence
- Often reveals information

---

## Closing Techniques

### Recognizing Closing Opportunity

**Signs They're Ready:**
- Smaller concessions
- Asking about settlement terms
- Discussing liens/distribution
- Tone shift from adversarial to collaborative

### Splitting the Difference

**When to Use:**
- Gap is small ($5-10K)
- Both parties have moved significantly
- Time pressure exists

**When to Avoid:**
- Early in negotiation
- Gap is large
- They haven't moved enough

### Final Number Presentation

**Make It Credible:**
- Round numbers seem negotiable ($50,000)
- Odd numbers seem calculated ($48,750)
- Explain why this is final
- Don't bluff if you'll move

---

## Documenting Negotiations

### After Each Communication

Record:
- Date/time of communication
- Method (phone, email, letter)
- Their position stated
- Our position stated
- Any new information
- Agreed next steps
- Follow-up date

### Example Note

```
Date: 2024-06-15
Method: Phone call with adjuster Jane Smith
Duration: 20 minutes

Their Position: Increased offer from $25K to $32K
Reasoning: "Reviewed records again, willing to move"

Our Position: Countered at $55K (down from $70K)
Reasoning: Cited comparable Smith v. Jones verdict

New Information: Adjuster mentioned supervisor review 
for anything over $40K

Next Steps: 
- They will call back by 6/22
- I will prepare litigation analysis if no movement

Follow-up: 6/24 if no response
```
