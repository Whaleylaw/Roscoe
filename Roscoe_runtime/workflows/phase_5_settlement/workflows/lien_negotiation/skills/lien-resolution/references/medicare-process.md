## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Register Case with Medicare

If not already done:
1. Call BCRC at 1-855-798-2627
2. Provide case information
3. Get case reference number

### Step 2: Request Conditional Payment Letter

1. Contact MSPRC
2. Request current conditional payment amount
3. Review itemized charges
4. Note any unrelated charges

### Step 3: Dispute Unrelated Charges

If charges include unrelated treatment:
1. Prepare written dispute
2. Include:
   - Case information
   - Specific charges disputed
   - Explanation why unrelated
   - Supporting documentation
3. Submit to MSPRC
4. Allow 30-45 days for review

### Step 4: Submit Settlement Information

After settlement reached:
1. Complete settlement information form
2. Include:
   - Settlement amount
   - Attorney fee percentage
   - Itemized costs
   - Settlement date
3. Submit to MSPRC

### Step 5: Request Procurement Cost Reduction

**Procurement Cost Formula:**
```
Attorney Fee Rate + (Costs ÷ Settlement) = Procurement %

Example:
33.33% + ($5,000 ÷ $100,000) = 38.33%

Medicare Lien: $20,000
Reduction: $20,000 × 0.3833 = $7,666
Final Lien: $20,000 - $7,666 = $12,334
```

### Step 6: Receive Final Demand

1. MSPRC issues final demand letter
2. Verify amount reflects:
   - Dispute resolutions
   - Procurement cost reduction
3. If incorrect, dispute in writing

### Step 7: Pay Lien

1. Pay within 60 days of final demand
2. Send payment to address specified
3. Include case reference number
4. Request satisfaction letter

1. Complete hardship waiver request
2. Document financial hardship
3. Submit to MSPRC
4. Waiver rarely granted but available

### Compromise

If client would receive nothing:
1. Request compromise consideration
2. Document that client needs funds
3. Show good faith effort to pay
4. Propose reduced amount
