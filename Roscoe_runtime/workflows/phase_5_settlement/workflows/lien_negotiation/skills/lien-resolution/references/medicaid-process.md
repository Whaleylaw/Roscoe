## Kentucky Statutory Framework

### KRS 205.608 - Key Provisions

1. Medicaid has automatic subrogation right
2. Lien attaches to any recovery
3. Must be repaid from settlement
4. Reduction formula applies

### Reduction Formula

Kentucky allows reduction based on:
- Attorney fees
- Litigation costs
- Proportionate recovery

**Basic Formula:**
```
Reduction % = (Attorney Fees + Costs) ÷ Gross Settlement

Adjusted Lien = Original Lien - (Original Lien × Reduction %)

Example:
Settlement: $50,000
Fees (33.33%): $16,665
Costs: $2,500
Reduction: ($16,665 + $2,500) ÷ $50,000 = 38.33%

Original Lien: $15,000
Reduction: $15,000 × 0.3833 = $5,750
Final Lien: $15,000 - $5,750 = $9,250
```
