# Medicaid Lien Reference

## Overview

Medicaid liens arise when state Medicaid programs pay for injury-related treatment. Unlike Medicare, Medicaid liens are governed primarily by state law.

## Governing Law

- **State Law**: Each state has specific Medicaid recovery statutes
- **Kentucky**: KRS 205.608 - Department for Medicaid Services (DMS)
- Federal anti-lien provisions limit recovery methods but allow subrogation

## Identification

Medicaid involvement exists when:
- Client currently receives Medicaid benefits
- Client received Medicaid at time of accident/treatment
- Client has pending Medicaid application

## Kentucky Medicaid Process

1. **Send Notice**: Notify DMS of representation
2. **Request Lien Amount**: DMS will provide itemized statement
3. **Verify Charges**: Confirm payments are accident-related
4. **Negotiate**: DMS typically reduces for attorney fees

## Reduction Potential

Kentucky Medicaid is often significantly negotiable:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Attorney fees | Typically reduced by 1/3 |
| Limited settlement | May reduce proportionally |
| Client hardship | Additional reduction possible |
| Disputed liability | Can argue for reduction |

**Typical Reduction**: 50% or more is common

## Timeline

| Stage | Timeframe |
|-------|-----------|
| Initial lien letter | 2-3 weeks |
| Dispute/negotiation | 30-60 days |
| Final amount | Before settlement disbursement |

## Common Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Lien exceeds settlement | Request hardship reduction |
| Unrelated charges | Dispute with medical records |
| Delayed response | Follow up every 2 weeks |
| Client still on Medicaid | Coordinate to avoid benefit disruption |

## Negotiation Arguments

- Limited settlement amount
- Client's ongoing medical needs
- Comparative fault reduced recovery
- Multiple liens competing for limited funds
- Client will remain on Medicaid (hardship)
