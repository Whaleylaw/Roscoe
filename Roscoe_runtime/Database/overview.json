According to the police report, Ms. Cristobal was struck when Hamilton merged into her lane, forcing her into the guardrail. She sustained a fractured left clavicle, chest pain, and shoulder pain, requiring emergency treatment at UofL Health - Mary & Elizabeth Hospital via EMS transport.\n\nMs. Cristobal has received extensive medical treatment including: emergency care at UofL hospitals, imaging at Heartland Imaging confirming the clavicular fracture, ongoing treatment at Aptiva Health (4/2/24-9/18/24), and chiropractic care at Starlite Chiropractic. Total medical expenses exceed $24,000, with approximately $9,540 paid through PIP benefits (Kentucky Farm Bureau claim #4943385, adjuster Lauren Baker) which are now exhausted.\n\nA lawsuit was filed in Jefferson County Circuit Court (24-CI-004728) with active litigation ongoing. Defense counsel Aletha Thomas (Kopka Pinkus Dolin) represents Crete Carrier Corporation, which initially denied liability through their BI coverage (claim #2024346878, adjuster Brenna Rine) on 4/4/24. \n\nDiscovery has been contentious, with multiple rounds of supplemental requests served regarding the commercial vehicle's Electronic Data Recorder (EDR) information. Defendant Hamilton claimed during deposition that no collision occurred while he was driving, alleging any damage happened later while parked - a position we dispute based on physical evidence. Defense counsel has been non-responsive to supplemental discovery requests about EDR data, leading to multiple follow-up communications from April through July 2025. A motion to compel discovery has been drafted and is ready for filing if defense responses are not received promptly.",

In doing so, she turned\ndirectly in front of Mr. Neltner\u2019s vehicle, which was traveling straight in the left eastbound lane.\nMr. Neltner had no time to react and struck Ms. Cohara\u2019s vehicle. The police narrative confirms\nthat the defendant failed to yield and crossed lanes improperly, causing the crash. The defendant\ncontinued onto the ramp and stopped partway down.\nCecelia sustained minor burn-like injuries, believed to be from airbag deployment, which\ncaused redness, blistering, and rash-like symptoms. She was prescribed topical treatment but has\nsince recovered, and there is no indication of ongoing issues or permanent injury.",
