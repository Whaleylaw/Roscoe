## Important Context for Claude Code

**Training Data Cutoff:** January 2025
**Current Date:** November 2025

Significant changes have occurred in the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem since the training cutoff. When working with LangChain or LangGraph code, **always reference** mcp server "langchain-docs" for the most current documentation links and implementation patterns.




Given the knowledge cutoff mismatch, always check this reference file for current APIs, best practices, and migration guides.
