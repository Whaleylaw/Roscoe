NARRATIVE DIAGRAM
I was a passenger on a party bus when we stopped
suddenly and slid causing people on the bus to
suddenly come out of their seat and some falling to
the floor. I was one of the people that fell on the floor
with 2 people landing on my leg. My foot and knee is
hurting and extremely swollen. When I went to the
ER and had X rays it showed that I have a fracture in
my knee and I was told to go to a orthopedic doctor.
