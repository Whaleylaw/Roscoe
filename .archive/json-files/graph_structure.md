So here's what I'm thinking, and what should have already happened, but I think we got some corruption in it, so it doesn't quite always work.   


/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/directory.json: This is the overall directory of every contact, so every person we deal with, every client, every insurance adjuster, every insurance company, every medical provider, doctor, expert, lawyer, or anybody who's ever been a contact with the office should be in here. So these should all be entities.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/case_relationship.json: now this has all of the people that are currently related somewhere in the case and how they relate to the case and the ID in each one should correlate to the UUID in the directory. For some reason, the UUIDs in the directory are not always in order. I don't know how that happened, but for example, Debra Marshall listed as a client and she is. It lists her case that she's attached to and it lists her ID as 2075, which in the directory matches the UUID that she has in the directory. This defines the relationship of some of the entities to some of the cases, but not all.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/clients.json: now this is a list of all the clients and their information which is duplicated from the directory to an extent but it has more information because they're clients. We don't keep track of date of birth or social security number for non-clients but when they become a client we track that. For example, for Cora Hall we have all of her information in here but we also have her date of birth and social security number and we have the project name for the relationship so we can see Cora Hall WC 1205 2022 is what she's related to. The UUID number I think should correspond to case numbers if we had those on there but we don't, so the UUID on this JSON is meaningless.  So these are all directory entries that would get a client classification or, you know, is client, you know, something like that.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/case-list.json: This is an accurate list of all the cases and the associated client with the case.As the current phase that the workflows are attuned to.And these are all the cases or projects. Projects would have you know as client or if you're for client or something and it would be the link to the client. Then it would be like has or you know associated with or linked to I don't know what how you would call the relationship to all of the other parts of the case like insurance. You know has insurance and then you know PIP You know has PIP coverage or PIP claim and then PIP claim would be like PIP is provided by Kentucky Farm Bureau. Kentucky Farm Bureau provides PIP. The link goes both ways. Then Kentucky Farm Bureau would be just an entity that's in the directory and then it would be like you know has insurance adjuster. And again, it's in the directory. It has claim number. So like the cases would have associations with insurance companies and clients and medical providers and lawyers and lien holders and expenses. 

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/insurance.json: These are all of the insurance companies by type and the case that they're associated with, plus information about the claim. The insurance company name and the insurance adjuster name. So, the insurance company should be associated with an entity in the directory just like the insurance adjuster.Now the case_relationships.json has the insurance adjusters, for some reason it doesn't have the insurance companies, but they should be matched to a, like on a graph, it would point to, you know, the directory for Farm Bureau, for example.So, the graph would take the entity Farm Bureau and say it is an insurance company and for the XYZ case provides PIP coverage.Or provides by Lanier coverage or provides UIM coverage or workers' comp coverage or whatever coverage they're providing.Then the adjuster would be James Osborne, which would be a directory entry. He would be his insurance adjuster for Kentucky Farm Bureau and his PIP adjuster for XYZ client or whatever they are.I don't know where you put the claim numbers. If the claim numbers are entities, then you have pip claim as claim number. Or pip claim has insurance company as adjuster is associated with or provides coverage for client is associated with project. And we'll need to make sure we are linking the insurance companies and the adjusters to their directory entries because that's where we'll get the contact information from.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/liens.json: These are liens. It has the project that they're associated with, and then it'll have the lien holder, which should correspond to an entry in the directory.The liens are linked to projects, liens are linked to lien holders, and they're linked to the directory.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/medical-providers.json: These are all of the medical providers for the client or for the cases. It doesn't list the clients, but each project or case only has one client. So it's obvious which ones they're treating, but there's different relationships here as well. And each medical_provider should be an entry in the directory, and we'll need to link those because the medical_providers just have the names and so the link in you know so the reference needs to be the directory because that's gonna have the contact information.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/litigation_contacts.json: And these are again just directory entries that are attorneys and so forth, usually for cases in litigation. 

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/overview.json: This can almost certainly just be an episode. So each overview, have the LLM read it. Read the summary and the status and when it started, and just the information that's in here as the overview. This could be the first episode that it adds for every case.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/notes.json: This is obviously just episodes, We may need to go over this, and a lot of it can be normalized like a lot of phone voice messages that have all this Ring Central jargon that's always attached at the end. We probably come up with a script to normalize all those whenever we add in a new insurance company or medical provider that always copies over as a note. Understanding what that content pattern is so that we can maybe just change all those to a more natural language note of what it is.But maybe look through it, find things with patterns, and then ask me, "Okay, what is this?" We can get a good natural language explanation or something to apply to the pattern to make it not quite so messy.Make it easier for the LLM when we run it through the episodes.We figure out which ones can be skipped or deleted.

/Volumes/X10 Pro/Roscoe/json-files/pleadings.json: These are probably just episodes. So let's probably not do anything with these until we decide to do something with the documents in a later run through.
