The email also carried a standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the information may be privileged and confidential, and outlining the steps to take if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 8:53 AM, Vittitow had written to Sarena Tuttle informing her that the faxed request for Michael Johnston did not include the medical release form. She instructed Sarena to refax the request with the medical release attached, and she noted that if chartswap was being used, Sarena should call the KORT Medical Records Department at 833-909-4044 to learn how to proceed with chartswap.

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Johnston-WC-05-03-2023\nClient: Michael Johnston\n\nNarrative:\n\nOn September 30, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, sent an email to Dana Ballinger at Ford Motor Company regarding WC Claim# 841603 for Michael Johnston, noting the topic as Outstanding Bills. The message, which carried Sarena\u2019s firm contact information and carried the new email address notice, was addressed to Mrs. Ballinger with Bryce Koon CC\u2019d. In this initial email, Sarena stated: \u201cGood morning Mrs. Ballinger, Please find attached medical billing that our client, Micheal Johnston, has been receiving. Please issue payment directly to the providers billing remittance and please forward an updated payment ledger reflecting payments made to our office. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\u201d The message also included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard signature block, showing the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and Sarena\u2019s direct line (502) 357-9971, main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note reading (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS). The body of the email included a warning line: \u201cWARNING: This message originated outside of Ford Motor Company. Use caution when opening attachments, clicking links, or responding.\u201d\n\nLater that same day, around 2:29 PM (the record shows the line as \u201cOn Mon, Sep 30, 2024 at 2:29?PM Ballinger, Dana (D.) wrote:\u201d indicating the time with a question mark), Dana Ballinger replied: \u201cThis one was paid. Attached is the EOB. The other 2 were never sent. I will call.\u201d Ballinger\u2019s note indicated that one of the three charges had been paid and that the EOB was attached, while the other two bills had not been sent, and she would follow up with a call.\n\nSubsequently, at 2:30 PM (the note shows the timestamp as 14:30:43 -0400), Sarena responded to Ballinger with: \u201cThank you so much for following up on those. Unfortunately, the EOB was not attached.\u201d Her reply echoed the chain of communication and requested resolution, also including her standard signature block for The Whaley Law Firm (same address and contact details as above) and again reiterating her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager. The thread also includes the earlier content from Sarena\u2019s initial message, in which she described the attached medical billing and requested payment to the providers\u2019 remittance and a forwarded updated payment ledger reflecting payments made to her office. Throughout the correspondence, the spelling in the 9:40 AM message referred to the client as \u201cMicheal Johnston,\u201d a variant of the name used in that attachment.\n\nIn summary, the exchange on September 30, 2024, centered on WC Claim# 841603 for Michael Johnston, with Sarena Tuttle requesting direct payments to providers and an updated ledger, Ballinger noting that one bill had been paid with the EOB attached and that the other two had not been sent, and Sarena later reporting that the EOB had not, in fact, been attached. The communications included Sarena\u2019s firm signature, the new email address notice, and standard contact details for both parties.",
