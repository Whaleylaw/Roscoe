      "natural_language": "Case: Owen-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024. Client: Owen Lindsey.\n\nIn this matter involving the Lindsey family and a motor vehicle accident dated December 1, 2024, communications circulated in early February and March of 2025 regarding medical treatment status and lien payments. On February 4, 2025, Chandler Wolfe, a branch claims representative for the Kentucky/Pennsylvania regional PIP office, sent an email asking for updates on any additional medical treatment or directions for Jeremy Lindsey, Elizabeth Lindsey, Chase Lindsey, and Owen Lindsey. He noted that, to date, the only medical bills received were for Ms. Elizabeth Lindsey. Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm replied later that morning, indicating that they were working on the matter.\n\nLater in February, Jessa\u2019s communication reiterated the ongoing effort to obtain updates on the Lindsey family\u2019s medical treatment and directions, with Jessa signing off as all the best from the Whaley Law Firm. Chandler Wolfe followed up again in this period, and his message referenced the firm\u2019s Customer Center, which would allow access to claim information anytime, anywhere.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, a forward was sent from Jessa Galosmo to attorneys Aaron Whaley and Justin Chumbley regarding file 300-0793616-2024 for Jeremy C. Lindsey. The forwarded message, from Chandler Wolfe, asked whether he should issue payments on the liens that had been received for Owen Lindsey and Chase Lindsey. Wolfe\u2019s contact details were provided: he is with the Kentucky/PIP team, with a phone number 800.346.0346 ext. 54628, fax 517.886.8754, and email KentuckyPIP.clm@aoins.com, operating from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST. The message also included Wolfe\u2019s professional signature and standard firm branding.\n\nIn response, Jessa informed Chandler that \u201cJeremy and Owen are already done treating,\u201d while \u201cElizabeth and Chase are still getting treatment.\u201d This status update was part of the March 7 exchange, following Chandler\u2019s inquiry about lien payments and the prior February email thread in which only Elizabeth\u2019s medical bills had been received.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the firm noted the existence of a Customer Center to enable claim information access at any time, and Jessa\u2019s communications consistently closed with courteous regards and the Whaley Law Firm contact information, including phone and fax numbers.",

Client: Owen Lindsey.\n\nIn the matter titled Re: #300-793616-2024, communications between Whaley Law Firm and Emily Pernice of AO Insurance were recorded in May 2025 regarding subrogation and settlement allocations. On May 7, 2025 at 11:52:30 AM (Eastern Time), Aaron Whaley emailed Emily Pernice, with Owen Lindsey\u2019s Filevine project address and the SouthCentralBodilyInjury.clm inbox CC\u2019d, to summarize the settlement allocations: Jeremy would receive $2,000; Owen Lindsey would receive $16,000; Chase would receive $16,000; and Elizabeth would receive $16,000. The message was titled Re: #300-793616-2024.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on May 6, 2025 at 2:13 PM, Emily Pernice asked Aaron to confirm the amounts allocated to each person\u2014Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, and Chase\u2014so the allocations could be finalized.\n\nThe thread also shows prior back-and-forth in late April 2025. On April 29, 2025, Aaron Whaley sent a message to Emily Pernice asking whether Auto Owners had made a decision about permitting settlement with the at-fault party. Later that day, at 10:46 AM, Emily Pernice replied that the matter was still under review for subrogation potential and that a full Coots Notice had been received by email on April 22, 2025. The thread includes subsequent May 6 emails in which Aaron and Emily continued to correspond about the same issue, with Aaron sending a follow-up on May 6 and Emily reiterating the need to confirm the allocation details.\n\nAcross the exchanges, the case involves a motor vehicle accident (MVA) related matter for Owen Lindsey, with subrogation considerations and a potential settlement with the at-fault party being explored in relation to Auto Owners, and a final allocation of the settlements among four individuals\u2014Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, and Chase\u2014being established as described above.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Owen-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024. Client: Owen Lindsey.\n\nOn May 7, 2025, an internal email forward was sent regarding the Owen Lindsey motor vehicle accident case. The message to Jennifer Howard at Progressive and to Owen Lindsey\u2019s Filevine project address noted that UIOM is waiving subrogation, and asked what else was needed to cut the checks. This forward was part of the thread labeled \u201cFwd: #300-0793616-2024.\u201d\n\nIn the forwarded chain, Emily Pernice, a Bodily Injury claims specialist with South Central Bodily Injury, replied that subrogation would be waived. Her reply stated simply, \u201cWe are waiving subrogation,\u201d and included her professional signature with contact information. This exchange followed a prior series of messages beginning several days earlier.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on April 29, 2025, Aaron Whaley asked Emily Pernice whether Auto Owners had decided to permit settlement with the at-fault party. Emily had responded that the matter was still under review for subrogation potential, and she noted that a full Coats (Coots) Notice had been received on April 22, 2025 by email, promising an immediate update once the review was complete.\n\nOver the course of the first week of May 2025, allocation details were discussed. On May 6, 2025 at 10:58 AM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Emily, copying Owen Lindsey and others, asking for confirmation of the amounts allocated to each person: Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, and Chase. The proposed allocations at that time were Jeremy: $2,000; Owen: $16,000; Chase: $16,000; Elizabeth: $16,000. Emily followed up later that day at 2:13 PM with a request to confirm the amounts allocated to each person (Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, Chase).\n\nOn May 7, 2025, a separate exchange reiterated the allocations, with Aaron listing: Jeremy: $2,000; Owen: $16,000; Chase: $16,000; Elizabeth: $16,000. At 11:56 AM, Emily wrote that she had thought the total underlying amount for the Lindsays was $49,500 and requested reconfirmation. In a subsequent note, she added, \u201cit is sorry I forgot. Do $1500 for Jeremy.\u201d This indicated a proposed adjustment to Jeremy\u2019s allocation from $2,000 to $1,500, while the other three allocations remained at $16,000 each, though the thread also shows the competing total of $49,500 versus the sum of the line-item allocations.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the thread consistently reflects the ongoing process of subrogation review, the status of a settlement with the at-fault party, and the allocations among involved parties (Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, and Chase). The May 7, 2025 correspondence confirms that UIOM was to waive subrogation and seeks to finalize the necessary details to proceed with issuing checks. The Filevine and email records also include the relevant contact details and references to claim centers and notices, as described in the messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case information: This record concerns the Owen-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024 case, with client Owen Lindsey.\n\nOn May 9, 2025, at 11:45:38 AM Eastern Time, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email about handling and hold-harmless matters, addressed to Jennifer Howard of Progressive Direct Insurance and cc\u2019d to the Owen Lindsey Filevine project email address. In that message, Whaley stated, \u201cI will handle and hold harmless.\u201d His firm\u2019s contact details were included: Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.\n\nEarlier, on May 9, 2025, at 11:16 AM, Jennifer Howard replied to the external thread. She confirmed receipt of the email and then asked to confirm the proposed breakdown of the client\u2019s bodily injury (BI) settlements: Jeremy Lindsey $1,500; Elizabeth Lindsey $16,000; Chase Lindsey $16,000; Owen Lindsey $16,000. She noted that she had been placed on notice of health insurance liens on the Lindsey family and asked whether these liens should be addressed by Progressive or deducted from the settlement proceeds. Howard provided her title as Claims Specialist-Sr. for Progressive Direct Insurance Company and supplied her contact information: P.O. Box 94670, Cleveland, OH 44101-9919, 859-629-4740 (W) and 833-905-1745 (F).\n\nThe email chain also shows the prior progression of communication about subrogation and settlement, beginning with a May 7, 2025 exchange. On May 7, 2025 at 12:10 PM, Aaron Whaley forwarded to Jennifer Howard and the Owen Lindsey Filevine address a message from himself to Jennifer, noting, \u201cJennifer, see below. UIOM is waiving subrogation. What else do you need to get the checks cut? Thanks.\u201d That same day, Emily Pernice of South Central Bodily Injury (AIC) replied at 12:07 PM, confirming, \u201cWe are waiving subrogation.\u201d Pernice\u2019s signature block identified her as AIC, AIC-M, AINS, and included her contact details: p: 800.346.0346 ext. 55169; f: 517.327.2391; e: pernice.emily@aoins.com, with hours 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST, plus a note about a Customer Center for claim access.\n\nThe thread shows earlier May 7 communications detailing allocation amounts. At 11:53 AM on May 7, Aaron Whaley wrote to Pernice and CC\u2019d Owen Lindsey and the SouthCentralBodilyInjury.clm address with a proposed distribution: Jeremy $2,000; Owen $16,000; Chase $16,000; Elizabeth $16,000, in response to an earlier inquiry about the allocations for the Lindsey parties. At 11:56 AM, Emily Pernice replied that she thought the total underlying amount for the Lindseys was $49,500 and asked for reconfirmation. Whaley replied, \u201cit is sorry I forgot. Do $1,500 for Jeremy.\u201d Pernice then reiterated her request to reconfirm the total, and Whaley again referenced the allocations: Jeremy $1,500, Owen $16,000, Chase $16,000, Elizabeth $16,000.\n\nBetween May 6 and May 7, Pernice sent multiple requests for confirmation of allocations. On May 6, 2025 at 2:13 PM, Pernice asked for confirmation of the amounts allocated to each person (Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, Chase), with a proposed distribution that initially listed: Jeremy $2,000, Owen $16,000, Chase $16,000, Elizabeth $16,000. Earlier that day, she had sent a similar inquiry, and at 10:58 AM Whaley had written to Pernice with a courtesy check-in about the matter. The chain shows ongoing discussion about subrogation potential and references to a \u201cfull Coots Notice\u201d that was received on April 22, 2025 by email.\n\nThe record notes that, on April 29, 2025, Whaley emailed Pernice to inquire whether Auto Owners had decided whether to permit settlement with the at-fault party. Pernice replied on April 29 that the matter was still under review for subrogation potential and that, once the review was complete, they would update, noting that the full Coots Notice had been received.\n\nIn sum, the communications reflect a process from late April through early May 2025 in which the subrogation potential was reviewed, UIOM indicated it would waive subrogation, and a proposed BI settlement breakdown for the Lindsey family was discussed and revised multiple times. By May 9, 2025, the parties had arrived at a proposed BI distribution of Jeremy Lindsey $1,500 and Elizabeth Lindsey, Chase Lindsey, and Owen Lindsey each at $16,000, with a direct acknowledgment from Progressive about the need to address health insurance liens. Jennifer Howard\u2019s May 9 response confirmed the breakdown and reiterated the lien concern, asking whether the liens should be addressed by Progressive or deducted from settlement proceeds. The May 9 exchange also confirms the ongoing involvement of Aaron Whaley on behalf of the Lindsey family and underscores that the matter remains coordinated among Whaley Law Firm, Progressive Direct Insurance Company, Emily Pernice of South Central Bodily Injury, and Owen Lindsey\u2019s file.",

On May 15, 2025, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent a forwarding note noting \u201cNo medicare\u201d and that Elizabeth Lindsey would sign the affidavits. This message accompanied the external thread regarding settlement with the Lindsey family related to file #300-0793616-2024.\n\nEarlier, on May 12, 2025 at 10:32 a.m., Jennifer Howard, a claims specialist for Progressive Direct Insurance, asked via email which parent should be named on the notarized affidavits for Chase and Owen, since their settlements would require affidavits. She also inquired whether any member of the Lindsey family might be eligible to receive Medicare benefits, and she attached the settlement releases for the Lindsey family.\n\nIn the days prior, communications circulated about subrogation and settlement structure. On May 9, 2025 at 11:46 a.m., Aaron Whaley replied that he would handle and hold harmless. His message included his contact information and indicated that he would take responsibility for that aspect of the matter. Earlier that same day, Jennifer Howard had engaged in a back-and-forth about the settlements\u2019 composition and the handling of health insurance liens. On May 9 at 11:16 a.m., she confirmed the need to verify the breakdown for the Lindsey clients\u2019 bodily injury settlements and asked for confirmation of the following allocations: Jeremy Lindsey, $1,500; Elizabeth Lindsey, $16,000; Chase Lindsey, $16,000; Owen Lindsey, $16,000. She also noted that health insurance liens had been placed on the Lindsey family and asked whether she should address them from settlement proceeds or handle them another way. She signed off with her Progressive contact information.\n\nThe discussion continued on May 7 and May 6, with multiple updates about subrogation and settlement allocations. On May 7 at 12:10 p.m., Aaron Whaley told Jennifer, \u201cJennifer, see below. UIOM is waiving subrogation. What else do you need to get the checks cut? Thanks.\u201d The same day, Emily Pernice of South Central Bodily Injury (AIC) replied, \u201cWe are waiving subrogation.\u201d Emily provided her contact information and noted standard business hours. Earlier that morning, at 11:59 a.m., Aaron advised, \u201cit is sorry I forgot. Do $1500 for Jeremy.\u201d At 11:56 a.m., Emily asked for reconfirmation, stating she believed the total underlying amount for the Lindsey family was $49,500 and requested confirmation. At 11:53 a.m., Aaron had provided a proposed allocation: Jeremy $2,000; Owen $16,000; Chase $16,000; Elizabeth $16,000. Emily reaffirmed with a follow-up later in the day about the total underlying amount and the need to reconfirm.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Emily asked Aaron to confirm the amounts allocated to each person (Jeremy, Elizabeth, Owen, Chase). Aaron replied at 10:58 a.m. with a brief check-in, and later that afternoon at 2:13 p.m. Emily requested confirmation of the allocations again, consistent with the prior discussion.\n\nThe thread traces further back to April 29, 2025. At 10:46 a.m., Emily indicated that the matter was still under review for subrogation potential and advised that full Coots Notice had been received by email on 04/22/2025. She promised updates once the review was complete. Prior to that, at 10:39 a.m., Aaron had followed up with Emily to see whether Auto Owners (insurer) had decided whether to permit settlement with the at-fault party.\n\nSummary of key points preserved in the correspondence:\n- The Lindsey family\u2019s settlement structure was under negotiation, with proposals for Jeremy Lindsey, Elizabeth Lindsey, Chase Lindsey, and Owen Lindsey.\n- The preliminary allocations circulated included Jeremy receiving amounts in the range of $1,500 to $2,000, and Elizabeth, Chase, and Owen each receiving approximately $16,000, with totals discussed around $49,500 as the underlying settlement pool.\n- Subrogation was a central issue: UIOM was noted as waiving subrogation, and Emily Pernice confirmed the waiver from the subrogation perspective.\n- Health insurance liens were identified as needing addressal, with questions about whether Progressive should handle them or deduct from settlement proceeds.\n- Notarized affidavits were required for Chase and Owen, and it was necessary to decide which Lindsey parent should be named on those affidavits.\n- Medicare eligibility was considered for the Lindsey family, with Jennifer asking who, if anyone, might qualify.\n- Elizabeth Lindsey was identified as the person who would sign affidavits, and a directive noted \u201cNo medicare\u201d in the May 15, 2025 message.\n\nOverall, the communications reflect a coordinated effort among counsel and the insurer to finalize the Lindsey settlements, confirm subrogation waivers, allocate settlement amounts among family members, prepare the necessary affidavits, and address health insurance liens and Medicare considerations, with the intent to issue settlement checks once all conditions, including notarization and lien resolution, were satisfied.",
