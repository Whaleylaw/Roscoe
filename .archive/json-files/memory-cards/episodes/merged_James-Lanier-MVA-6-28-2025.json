At this stage, the bodily injury (BI) limits of the other party are unknown.\n\nOn August 20, 2025, Justin from the Whaley law firm emailed Aaron Whaley with a note about the orthopedist. He observed that the orthopedic doctor is apparently willing to prepare a narrative report for the client, who has two labral tears, but that the doctor appears to want to charge for the report. Justin asked whether it is worth pursuing the narrative report or if a normal request for medical records should be sent instead. He also noted the Alabama accident and that BI limits were still unclear.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 8:56 AM, Jim Lanier replied to Justin with Dr. Schertzinger’s response to Lanier’s prior letter requesting medical bills, treatment, diagnosis, and recommendations. Lanier relayed Dr. Schertzinger’s reply: “Yes during office hours at a time convenient for you is best for documentation.

I'm sure that you are aware that in Alabama, the scene of the accident, “shared fault” in rear-end collision claims are governed by the legal doctrine of contributory negligence, meaning that if you are even 1% at fault for the accident, you are barred from recovering any damages whatsoever, even if the other driver was primarily responsible, according to legal resources. This strict standard makes proving fault in rear-end collisions crucial for obtaining compensation in Alabama.\nI can prove that I provided enough time and space to responsibly stop in a manner to remain safe and not collide with the car in front of me. The car behind me cannot say the same nor can they prove that they were prudent in providing the same level of care as I did to provide enough time and space to successfully avoid hitting me. Hence, they were clearly negligent.\nWe were traveling at about 50 mph. If the driver had provided 5 car lengths of distance between my car and theirs, then they could have successfully avoided hitting me and my family from behind.\nThe indisputable fact is that the driver’s speed, lack of distance between their car and mine, and lack of good judgement left the driver negligent from doing everything possible to successfully avoid hitting me and my family from behind.\nThe other indisputable fact is that if the driver did use good judgement, and the driver did leave enough time and space, and the driver did do everything possible to avoid a collision, then there would have been zero chance of the driver ever hitting me.\nBest Regards,\nJim Lanier\n513-288-8834",

Client: James Lanier.\n\nIn an email dated Tuesday, August 19, 2025 at 5:19 PM, from Jim Lanier to Justin (Attorney), the subject line RE: Progressive knows that in Alabama it’s all or nothing…, Lanier discusses Progressive’s position in a motor vehicle accident case. He notes that Progressive is arguing that their client was 100% not at fault. He reminds that in Alabama, the scene of the accident, “shared fault” in rear-end collision claims is governed by the doctrine of contributory negligence, meaning that if you are even 1% at fault, you are barred from recovering any damages whatsoever, even if the other driver was primarily responsible, according to legal resources. He explains that this strict standard makes proving fault in rear-end collisions crucial for obtaining compensation in Alabama.\n\nLanier states that he can prove he provided enough time and space to responsibly stop in a manner to remain safe and not collide with the car in front of him. He asserts that the car behind him cannot say the same nor can they prove that they were prudent in providing the same level of care as he did to provide enough time and space to successfully avoid hitting him. Hence, he contends, they were clearly negligent. They were traveling at about 50 mph. If the driver behind had provided five car lengths of distance between his car and theirs, then they could have successfully avoided hitting Lanier and his family from behind.\n\nLanier presents what he calls indisputable facts: the driver’s speed, lack of distance between their car and his, and lack of good judgement left the driver negligent for not doing everything possible to successfully avoid hitting him and his family from behind. He also states another indisputable fact: if the driver had used good judgement, left enough time and space, and done everything possible to avoid a collision, there would have been zero chance of the driver ever hitting him.\n\nBest regards,\nJim Lanier\n513-288-8834",

Given my age, the success rate for repairable surgery is under 40%. Therefore, my doctor recommends debridement surgery to remove dead tissue from the torn labrum, which will aid in the growth of healthy tissue and improve shoulder function. My doctor is also concerned about my ongoing severe neck muscle spasms and has scheduled an MRI to assess my neck. The MRI results will dictate the timing of my shoulder surgery. The cost estimate provided by my doctor shows that this type of surgery will cost approximately $17,000 and will provide you with that documentation.\n\nI would like to set up a brief call with you to discuss further.",
