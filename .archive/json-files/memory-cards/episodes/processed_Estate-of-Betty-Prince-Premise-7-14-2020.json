      "natural_language": "On October 27, 2021, the Estate of Betty Prince received an email statement from Robert Prince, forwarded by Jayme Larrison, who is not computer savvy. The statement details the events of the day in question regarding Betty Prince. Robert explains that before leaving the house to go to Norton\u2019s Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, he assisted Betty with bathing and dressing, and walked beside her from the house to his car. They then drove more than 60 miles to Norton\u2019s Hospital and parked in the guest parking lot. Betty was unable to walk into the facility without help, so Robert walked beside her for stability and direction. Upon entering the hospital, they both completed Covid screening procedures, including a temperature check and answering a few questions, with Betty standing during the screening while holding Robert\u2019s arm. Betty then walked to the admitting area with his assistance. \n\nWhen they reached the registration office, Betty had become weaker, with her pace and endurance diminished and her breathing shallower and more labored. In the waiting room of the registration area, Betty was seated in a chair. After a short interval, the office employee called her name and Robert helped her stand. Betty remained weak and short of breath. As they approached the doorway, Robert was told that, due to Covid regulations, he could not enter the office area, and no assistance or safety aids (such as a wheelchair, walker, or direct personal help) were offered to the patient. After a short period, the office staff member opened the door and Betty followed, but again no assistance to ensure her safety was provided. \n\nAs Betty stepped into the waiting room, she fell backward and hit her head on the floor, resulting in a large cut to the back of her head. Robert Prince immediately went to her side; she was lying on her back in a puddle of blood. At that time, no one offered assistance to address her injury, nor was anyone monitoring her vitals. Robert asked a staff member for a towel, and after receiving it he applied pressure to the bleeding area on her head. Two calls were made to the ER. After about 10 minutes, two medical staff arrived and transported Betty Prince to the ER. She received nine stitches in her head, and a CT scan revealed active bleeding in her brain. Betty was admitted to the hospital and placed in the Intensive Care Unit. After thirty-six hours she was moved to a private room, where she remained for an additional thirty-six hours before being released. An appointment was scheduled to return in two weeks for another CT scan to monitor her progress. \n\nThese are the events to the best of my knowledge that occurred on the day in question.

An email from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle notified her that medical discovery production had been added to the Dropbox folder related to Prince v. Norton Hospitals. The message stated that a link, provided in a previous email, grants access to the medical and billing records received regarding Betty Prince, and it invited any questions or issues and offered to be contacted for assistance.\n\nThe forwarded message was originated by Anthony Luken, a paralegal at Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, and was dated Friday, July 29, 2022, at 1:19 PM.

Robert asked that, if we need anything in writing, we call him and go over it on the phone while we write for him, and I advised that would be fine moving forward.\n\nHe again expressed his belief that Norton\u2019s killed his wife. After S/F she was being treated at Kings\u2019 Daughter for dialysis to remove fluid. Kings\u2019 Daughter was not able to pull soft enough and was causing a strain on her heart. They sent her back to Norton's where the orders for a slow, soft pull were ignored and her pressure dropped extremely low. They unhooked her from the machine around 7 p.m. She had trouble breathing and ultimately died at 4 a.m. The client wants this to be included in the current case. I advised I would reach out to Associate and make sure he is aware. #cc",

The forwarded email also contained the standard confidentiality disclaimer identifying the email as intended for the recipients and instructing that any unauthorized use should be avoided.\n\nLater, at 11:46 a.m. that same day, Joseph M. Effinger, Esq., of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, LLP, forwarded the prior message to Andrea Higgins. Effinger\u2019s signature listed his firm\u2019s contact information: 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202; telephone (502) 583-9900; facsimile (502) 587-1927. The forwarded message again bore the firm\u2019s confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAt 4:01 p.m. on July 21, 2023, Andrea L. Higgins, the Legal Assistant to Joseph M. Effinger, Matthew A. Piekarski, Ryan D. Nafziger, and Blake Gerstner, sent an email to Sarena Tuttle. In her message, Higgins requested: \u201cPlease provide the Plaintiff's executed Medical and Social Security authorizations as indicated in the Responses to Defendant's discovery requests.\u201d Higgins\u2019 signature identified her as the Legal Assistant to the named attorneys and provided her contact information: ahiggins@ppoalaw.com and (502) 560-9982. The signature also repeated the firm\u2019s address and contact details, including 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202, and the firm\u2019s main phone and fax numbers (P 502.583.9900 | F 502.587.1927). The email also reproduced the confidentiality notice customary to correspondence from Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, indicating the message is for the sole use of the intended recipients and should not be copied or forwarded to unauthorized persons, with instructions to contact the sender if the message was received in error and to destroy all copies.\n\nAdditionally, Sarena Tuttle\u2019s original email carried the firm\u2019s standard letterhead and disclaimers, including the note to contact the sender if not the intended recipient and the instruction to destroy any copies if misdirected. The correspondence reflects a coordinated effort among the lawyers and staff at The Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC to obtain the plaintiff\u2019s executed Medical and Social Security authorizations as part of the discovery responses in the 21-CI-003798 matter.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the correspondence in the Estate of Betty Prince\u2019s case (Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020) regarding the matter 21-CI-003798, Robert Prince v Norton Hospital, specifically the Plaintiff\u2019s Responses to the Defendant\u2019s discovery requests and the related medical and social security authorizations.\n\nOn July 21, 2023, at 11:23 a.m., Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Andrea L. Higgins at Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, with copies to Joseph Effinger and Ryan Nafziger and with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon CC\u2019d. The message stated that attached were the client\u2019s Responses to Norton Hospital\u2019s Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents, and it included Sarena\u2019s signature and her contact information, noting her new email address. The email also contained the standard confidentiality notice typical of correspondence from PPOA.\n\nEarlier that same morning, at 11:46 a.m., Joseph M. Effinger, Esq., on behalf of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, forwarded the email chain to Andrea Higgins (the Legal Assistant to several PPOA attorneys) at PPOA, including the firm\u2019s contact information and reiterating the message thread.\n\nAt approximately 12:01 p.m. on July 21, 2023, Andrea Higgins responded, notifying Sarena that the Plaintiff\u2019s executed Medical and Social Security authorizations were to be provided as indicated in the discovery responses. Higgins\u2019s message included her own contact details and the firm\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAround 12:55 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied that Mr. Prince is not able to receive or execute documents electronically. The Authorizations/Releases had been forwarded to Mr. Prince via USPS for execution and would be supplemented upon receipt. Her message also reiterated her role and provided her contact information, including the note to use her new email address.\n\nApproximately two minutes later, at 12:57 p.m., Andrea Higgins replied with, \u201cSarena, Please provide the Plaintiff\u2019s executed Medical and Social Security authorizations as indicated in the Responses to Defendant\u2019s discovery requests,\u201d followed by her signature block and the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nThe thread continued with the same day\u2019s exchanges, including the earlier messages from Sarena and the PPOA staff, which collectively documented the process and expectations regarding the plaintiff\u2019s execution of the requested authorizations.\n\nFinally, on August 2, 2023, at 10:44 a.m., Sarena Tuttle sent another email to Andrea Higgins apologizing for the delayed delivery of the requested authorizations and attaching the documents. She again provided her contact information and noted her new email address. The August 2 message reflects the ongoing effort to obtain the necessary medical and social security authorizations for the case, acknowledging that Mr. Prince could not receive or sign electronically and that the authorizations had been mailed or would be supplemented upon receipt. The message includes the same standard confidentiality notices common to PPOA communications and reiterates the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s representation of the Estate of Betty Prince in the Robert Prince v Norton Hospital matter.",

Norton Hospital, focused on the Plaintiff\u2019s responses to discovery requests and the processing of medical and social security authorizations.\n\nOn Friday, July 21, 2023, at 11:23 AM, Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Andrea Higgins of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, with copies to Matthew Piekarski, Joseph Effinger, and Ryan Nafziger, and with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon in the CC line. The message stated that attached were the client\u2019s Responses to Norton Hospital\u2019s Interrogatories and Request for Production of Documents. Sarena signed the email with her contact information and noted her new Whaley Law Firm email address.\n\nAt 11:46 AM that same day, Joseph Effinger, Esq., forwarded Sarena\u2019s email to Andrea Higgins at PPOA, including his own firm contact details. The forwarded message reiterated the contents of Sarena\u2019s email regarding the discovery responses.\n\nAt 12:01 PM, Andrea Higgins replied to Sarena, requesting that the Plaintiff\u2019s executed Medical and Social Security authorizations be provided as indicated in the responses to the defendant\u2019s discovery requests. Andrea\u2019s signature block identified her as Legal Assistant to Joseph M. Effinger, Esq.; Matthew A. Piekarski, Esq.; Ryan D. Nafziger, Esq.; and Blake Gerstner, Esq., with the PPOA contact information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer present at the bottom of the message.\n\nAt 12:55 PM, Sarena responded that Mr. Prince is not able to receive or execute documents electronically, and that the Authorizations/Releases had been forwarded to Mr. Prince via USPS for execution and would be supplemented upon receipt. She again signed with her Whaley Law Firm title and updated contact details, including her new email address.\n\nAt approximately 12:57 PM, Andrea Higgins replied to Sarena with a brief \u201cOkay. Thank you,\u201d concluding that portion of the exchange.\n\nSeveral days later, on Friday, August 2, 2023, at 10:45 AM, Sarena wrote again to Andrea Higgins: she apologized for the delayed delivery of the requested authorizations and advised that the authorizations were attached to the email. Her message included her standard signature blocks and newly noted email address.\n\nThat same day, the line item \u201cReceived. Thank you!\u201d appeared in an email from Andrea Higgins at 14:57:35 UTC, confirming receipt of the attached materials.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the correspondence repeatedly bears the standard confidentiality and privileged-information disclaimers typical of the Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC firm signatures, including the firm\u2019s address at 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, phone and fax numbers, and the firm\u2019s website. In several messages, Sarena notes the new Whaley Law Firm email address used for professional contact, and the discussions center on providing and timing the Plaintiff\u2019s executed Medical and Social Security authorizations, the Plaintiff\u2019s inability to receive electronic documents, and the transmission of the required authorizations via USPS with supplementation upon receipt.",

He warned that if responses were not provided very soon, he would be forced to file a Motion to Compel. He asked for a response.\n\nEarlier still, on August 17, 2023, at 10:52 a.m., Koon wrote to rnafziger@ppoalaw.com and jeffinger@ppoalaw.com (cc\u2019ing BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). He observed that they had received responses to their Requests for Admission some time earlier, but the emails indicated that there had been no responses to Interrogatories or document requests. He noted that he had sent a letter a few weeks prior and had received no response. He asked when they could expect answers to these discovery requests.\n\nIn summary, the estate\u2019s counsel faced delayed discovery responses in the Norton Hospital case and sought confirmation of the identity of the deposition subject identified only by initials LV, along with proposed deposition dates. They also communicated a willingness to allow additional time for discovery responses but pressed for timely responses or the possibility of a Motion to Compel if such responses were not forthcoming. The timeline shows a pattern of repeated requests and responses across mid-to-late August 2023, with the most recent August 28 message seeking to move forward with scheduling and identifying the LV individual.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Hospital, Inc., Jefferson Circuit Court case 21-CI-003798, discovery has been the subject of ongoing correspondence between the Estate\u2019s counsel and opposing counsel. The case is titled Estate of Betty Prince, with the client listed as the Estate of Betty Prince, and the case file reference includes Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. The communications flow from mid-August through September 2023 and involve the discovery schedule for Interrogatories, Documents requests, and Requests for Admission, as well as a deposition relevant to an identified individual.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to opposing counsel (rnavziger@ppoalaw.com and jeffinger@ppoalaw.com, cc\u2019ing BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). He noted that the defendants\u2019 Responses for Admission had been received earlier, but no answers had been provided to the Interrogatories or the Document Requests. He indicated that he had emailed a letter a few weeks prior on the matter and asked for an advisory on when answers could be expected. The message included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nTwo days later, on August 22, 2023, Bryce Koon sent two separate messages. At 2:32 PM, he again pressed that he had not heard back regarding his previous email and letter. He stated that it had been an inordinate amount of time since the discovery requests were propounded and that no responses had been received to date. He warned that if responses were not forthcoming very soon, he would be forced to file a Motion to Compel. The email carried the same attorney-client privilege disclaimer and contact details for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 2:46 PM the same day, Ryan Nafziger replied. He said he was in the process of completing the discovery requests and would have them to Bryce Koon by the end of the following week. He recalled that it had previously taken almost a year and a-half of emailing to obtain complete responses to their requests and thanked Bryce for his patience. This message also included the standard privilege disclaimer and the familiar contact information for the parties.\n\nOn August 28, 2023, Bryce Koon replied to Nafziger and Effinger. He indicated that they were certainly willing to grant additional time for the responses. He asked to proceed with scheduling the deposition for the individual identified in an attached document. He noted that the only information available about this individual appeared to be initials \u201cLV,\u201d and that the name itself was not provided. He requested identification of the individual and suggested providing potential deposition dates. The communication again carried the standard privilege disclaimer and the Whaley Law Firm contact details.\n\nFinally, on September 15, 2023, Bryce Koon sent a follow-up email to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with the subject Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospital, Inc. (Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798) - Discovery. He wrote in the body: Good afternoon counsel, it has been a few weeks since their previous discussions. He asked when they could expect responses to the discovery requests and whether the opposing side had identified the individual previously referenced. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address, telephone, and fax numbers, and again included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nAcross all exchanges, the emails repeatedly included standard disclaimers stating the message was intended only for the named recipient and could contain attorney-client privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient was instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to disclose or forward the contents. The correspondences also reflect the ongoing effort to resolve discovery responses, to schedule the deposition for the individual identified only by initials LV, and to obtain clarity on the identity of that person, all within the procedural context of the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Hospital, Inc.",

      "natural_language": "In the estate case titled Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospital, Inc. ( Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798 ), the Estate of Betty Prince is the client. The case involved ongoing discovery disputes, and a chain of email communications from August through September 2023 shows the efforts of counsel for the estate to obtain responses, schedule depositions, and identify an individual referenced in discovery.\n\nOn August 17, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, emailed the opposing counsel (Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger) noting that while responses to the Requests for Admission had been received, there did not appear to be responses to the Interrogatories or the Document Requests. He said a letter had been sent a few weeks prior and asked for guidance on when the remaining discovery responses would be provided.\n\nSeveral days later, on August 22, 2023, Koon sent two emails. In the first, at 2:32 p.m., he stated that he had not heard back regarding his previous email and that it had been an inordinate amount of time since the requests were propounded; he warned that if responses were not received very soon, he would be forced to file a Motion to Compel. He also asked whether the individual referenced in the attached document could be identified. Later that same day, at 2:46 p.m., Nafziger replied that he was in the process of completing the discovery and would have the materials to Koon by the end of the following week; Nafziger also recalled prior experience of nearly a year and a half of emailing to obtain complete responses and thanked Koon for his patience. The exchange included reference to a file or link titled BettyPrinceSFZ954585.\n\nAlso on August 22, 2023, there was a second message from Koon to Nafziger and Effinger (with BettyPrinceSFZ954585 in copy) indicating that he would continue to work toward obtaining the discovery responses, while acknowledging the ongoing effort required.\n\nOn August 28, 2023, Koon emailed again, indicating that the opposing side could have additional time to provide the discovery responses if needed. He also asked to proceed with scheduling the deposition of the individual identified in the attached document. He noted that the person\u2019s name was not known, only initials \u201cLV,\u201d and he requested identification of that individual along with potential deposition dates.\n\nOn September 15, 2023, Koon followed up by asking when the discovery responses could be expected and whether the individual referenced earlier could be identified.\n\nFinally, on September 22, 2023, Koon wrote that he had not heard back regarding the outstanding discovery responses and that he needed the client\u2019s answers by Wednesday, September 27, 2023. He warned that if the responses were not provided by that date, he would be forced to file the attached motion. The message reiterated the same contact information and included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer common to The Whaley Law Firm emails, which states that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, avoid waiving any privilege, and not use the information or forward it to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nAcross the sequence, the emails repeatedly documented the pursuit of discovery responses to Interrogatories and Document Requests, the status of Responses to Requests for Admission (which had been received), the attempt to identify the individual referenced by initials (LV), and the scheduling of a deposition, all while noting the need to preserve privilege and confidentiality through standard email notices. The communications reflect a persistent effort by the Estate of Betty Prince\u2019s counsel to move the discovery process forward and to enforce timely responses under the court\u2019s expectations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. Client: Estate of Betty Prince. Re: Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798).\n\nIn December 2023, counsel from The Whaley Law Firm coordinated deposition dates in the case Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798). The exchanges center on whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom may be deposed and on scheduling a deposition for Mr. Robert Prince, the latter being referenced as Mr. Prince in the emails. The correspondence involves W. Bryce Koon, Esq., the Whaley Law Firm, and colleagues including Sarena M. Tuttle, Ryan Nafziger, Blake Gerstner, Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, and Aaron Whaley. The note set captures four email communications, spanning December 7, 11, 12, and 26, 2023, with standard confidentiality and privilege notices included in each message.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, at 3:50 PM, Bryce Koon sent the initial request. He asked counsel to confirm whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom, identified in the Safety and Security Report provided in the opposing party\u2019s discovery production, is still employed by Norton and, if so, to provide potential deposition dates. His message concluded with his contact information: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone (502) 365-5043, fax (502) 237-3207. The email included the customary attorney-client privileged disclaimer indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and outlining the precautionary steps if received in error.\n\nThree days later, on December 11, 2023, at 4:48 PM, Ryan Nafziger replied. He indicated his understanding that Ms. Vinsom remained a Norton employee and that he was checking with her to obtain deposition dates. He also stated an additional desire to request Mr. Robert Prince\u2019s deposition if Bryce Koon could check with him for dates. This message was addressed to Bryce Koon, with copies to Blake Gerstner and Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, and Sarena Tuttle, and it carried the same standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, at 10:08 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded to Nafziger. She informed him that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability, and she noted that they had confirmed Mr. Prince currently does not have any standing appointment to work around. She requested that Nafziger\u2019s office provide dates for deposing Mr. Prince. This reply was sent to Ryan Nafziger with copies to Bryce Koon, Blake Gerstner, Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, and Aaron Whaley, and she also included a note that Mr. Prince\u2019s information reflects a new email address for the sender. The message ended with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard disclaimer about confidentiality and privilege.\n\nFinally, on December 26, 2023, at 3:15 PM (\u22120500), Bryce Koon followed up with the group. He asked, \u201cDo we have any potential dates yet for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition?\u201d The email was sent to the same recipients listed in the first message, with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s confidentially disclaimer included.\n\nAcross these communications, the core issues being pursued were (1) whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom is currently employed and available for deposition, with counsel seeking potential deposition dates, and (2) whether Mr. Robert Prince\u2014described as retired and with open availability\u2014could be deposed, with the opposing side asked to propose dates. The exchanges also record the evolving understanding of Mr. Prince\u2019s status (retired with no standing work commitments) and the ongoing effort to coordinate deposition scheduling, all within the case captioned Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798). The messages consistently include the standard attorney-client privilege/confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. Client: Estate of Betty Prince. This note records a series of internal emails regarding the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (case number 21-CI-003798), focusing on scheduling depositions of two individuals identified in discovery: Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom and Mr. Robert Prince.\n\nThe exchange began on December 7, 2023, when W. Bryce Koon, an attorney with The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Ryan Nafziger and others asking for potential deposition dates for Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom, who was identified in the Safety and Security Report provided in the discovery production. Bryce also asked whether Ms. Vinsom remained a Norton employee and requested potential dates for her deposition.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied to Bryce (and copied others) that his understanding was that Ms. Vinsom was still a Norton employee. He said he would check with her to obtain deposition dates and added that he would also like to request Mr. Robert Prince\u2019s deposition if Bryce could check with him for dates.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded. She stated that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability, and that he currently does not have any standing appointment to work around. She asked that dates be sent for deposing Mr. Prince.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, Bryce Koon followed up via email to Sarena Tuttle and Ryan Nafziger, asking whether there were any potential dates yet for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied that he was still working on obtaining dates and would get back to Bryce the following week, wishing everyone a Happy New Year. This exchange was part of a forwarded thread that Bryce later circulated, which included Bryce\u2019s earlier inquiry about Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition dates and Ryan\u2019s ongoing efforts to secure dates.\n\nThe emails include standard attorney-client privilege disclosures and signatures. Bryce\u2019s messages show the Whaley Law Firm contact details (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) and note that the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com is a new contact. The messages also list other recipients who were copied, including Blake Gerstner, Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, and Aaron Whaley, among others. The overarching topic is coordinating deposition dates for Lucretia Vinsom, a Norton employee identified in discovery, and for Mr. Robert Prince, a party associated with the estate who was described as retired and available for deposition.",

Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address), responded to Ryan Nafziger. She thanked him and confirmed that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability. She noted that Mr. Prince does not have any standing appointment to work around, and she asked that dates be sent for depositing Mr. Prince.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, Bryce Koon sent another email regarding the case. Addressed to Sarena Tuttle and Ryan Nafziger with the same recipients in CC, he asked whether there were any potential dates yet for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. The message again referenced the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798) and included the standard privilege disclaimer and attachments customary to such communications.\n\nFinally, on December 29, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied to Bryce and Sarena, noting that he was still working on obtaining deposition dates and would get back to them the following week. He concluded with New Year wishes. This message also carried the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the parties consistently referenced deposing Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom as identified in the Safety and Security Report from discovery, and Mr. Robert Prince (the estate\u2019s related party) as a potential deponent. They discussed whether Ms. Vinsom remained a Norton employee and the availability of Mr. Prince, who is retired, with no current standing appointment, and thus potentially available for a deposition. The exchanges also included formal signatures and standard privilege notices typical of this type of litigation communication.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. Client: Estate of Betty Prince. This note concerns the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (case number 21-CI-003798). The correspondence below reflects efforts by counsel for the Estate to schedule depositions in the Norton Hospitals matter, specifically deposition dates for Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom, as identified in Norton\u2019s discovery materials, and a potential deposition of Mr. Robert Prince.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to counsel at PPOA and to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, requesting potential deposition dates for Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom, who is identified in the Safety and Security Report included in the discovery production. He asked to confirm whether Ms. Vinsom remains a Norton employee and to provide dates for her deposition.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied that Ms. Vinsom is still a Norton employee and that he was checking with her to obtain deposition dates. He also stated an interest in requesting Mr. Robert Prince\u2019s deposition if dates could be arranged.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied. She stated that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability, with no standing appointment to contend with. She asked that the offices send dates for deposing Mr. Prince.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, in a separate thread, Bryce Koon had also asked whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom could be deposed and requested potential dates for that deposition, referencing Vinsom\u2019s identification in the Safety and Security Report.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, Bryce Koon again asked whether there were any potential dates for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition.\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Ryan Nafziger responded that he was still working on obtaining dates and would get back next week, and he extended holiday wishes for a Happy New Year.\n\nOn January 8, 2024, Bryce Koon sent a follow-up to Ryan Nafziger asking whether there had been progress on obtaining dates for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition.\n\nAll of these messages include customary attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notices: the electronic messages are intended only for the named recipients; they may contain privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient is instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to use or forward the information, as no waiver of privilege applies.\n\nAdditional context from the thread includes contact details and identifiers for the parties. The Whaley Law Firm is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with Bryce Koon\u2019s phone number listed as (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 364-9363 (some messages reflect a fax number of (502) 237-3207). Sarena Tuttle\u2019s contact information is listed as D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noted as the new email address). The correspondence to and from Ryan Nafziger and other recipients includes the PPOA firm addresses and the other participants: Blake Gerstner, Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, and Aaron Whaley.\n\nIn short, between early December 2023 and early January 2024, counsel pursued scheduling for Lucretia Vinsom\u2019s deposition (and discussed Mr. Prince\u2019s deposition as well). It was established that Ms. Vinsom remains a Norton employee and that Mr. Prince is retired with open availability and no scheduling conflicts due to standing appointments. No deposition dates were provided in these messages, and the parties continued to seek available dates for both depositions.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, docket number 21-CI-003798, the Estate of Betty Prince (the client) and The Whaley Law Firm were coordinating depositions related to the case. The communications, occurring between December 2023 and February 2024, sought to schedule depositions of two witnesses: Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom and Mr. Robert Prince (the decedent\u2019s father). The principal participants were W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and counsel for Norton Hospitals, including Ryan Nafziger and litigation paralegal Sarena M. Tuttle. (Sarena\u2019s signature notes a new email address, and the signature block for Bryce includes the Whaley firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact numbers.)\n\nThe scheduling effort began on December 7, 2023, when Bryce Koon asked whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom could be deposed, noting that Vinsom was identified in the Safety and Security Report provided in Norton\u2019s discovery production, and requesting potential deposition dates if she remained with Norton. In reply on December 11, 2023, Ryan Nafziger indicated his understanding that Ms. Vinsom was still a Norton employee and that he was checking with her to obtain deposition dates; he also expressed a desire to request Mr. Robert Prince\u2019s deposition if dates could be found. On December 12, 2023, Sarena Tuttle, Norton\u2019s litigation paralegal, replied that Mr. Prince was retired and had open availability, with no standing appointment to work around, and she asked that dates be provided for deposing Mr. Prince.\n\nBryce followed up on December 26, 2023, asking for potential dates for Lucretia Vinsom\u2019s deposition. On December 29, 2023, Nafziger replied that he was still working on obtaining dates and would get back next week, and he wished everyone a happy new year. The same day, Bryce had earlier communications with the group regarding the search for dates, including availability inquiries for Ms. Vinsom.\n\nIn early January 2024, Nafziger provided an update on Ms. Vinsom\u2019s availability: she was available January 29 and 30, and February 1, 2, and 5\u20139; she would be unavailable the week of February 12\u201316, but could be scheduled after that if needed. Nafziger noted that he could host the depositions at his office and that they could potentially be scheduled on the same day for both witnesses. Bryce responded on January 8, 2024, asking whether progress had been made on obtaining dates for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. A follow-up exchange occurred on January 9, 2024, when Bryce wrote that he had spoken with Mr. Prince and that Tuesday, February 6 would work best for all parties. He closed with his customary contact information.\n\nThus, the record reflects a coordinated effort across December 2023 and early January 2024 to schedule depositions of Lucretia Vinsom and Mr. Robert Prince, with the parties ultimately aiming to conduct both depositions on a single day (Tuesday, February 6, 2024) at the office of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, in Louisville, Kentucky.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798). Client: Estate of Betty Prince.\n\nIn the binders for the Estate of Betty Prince, counsel began a series of email exchanges in December 2023 and January 2024 concerning depositions of two Norton witnesses in the matter. The first request, dated December 7, 2023, came from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm. He asked whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom, identified in the Safety and Security Report produced in discovery, would be available for deposition and requested potential dates for scheduling her deposition.\n\nOn December 11, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied that Ms. Vinsom is apparently still a Norton employee and that he would check with her to obtain deposition dates. He also indicated a desire to request the deposition of Mr. Robert Prince, asking Bryce Koon to check with Mr. Prince for possible dates.\n\nThe following day, December 12, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded. She stated that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability, and that he currently does not have any standing appointments to work around. She advised sending dates for Mr. Prince\u2019s deposition.\n\nLater in December, on December 26, 2023, Bryce Koon asked whether there were any potential dates yet for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. Ryan Nafziger did not provide dates at that time but indicated on December 29, 2023, that he was still working on obtaining dates and would follow up the next week, wishing everyone a Happy New Year.\n\nAs January 2024 began, Ryan provided a concrete window for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. On January 8, 2024, he informed Bryce that Ms. Vinsom was available January 29, 30 and February 1, 2 and 5\u20139. He noted that she would be unavailable the week of February 12\u201316, but could be available afterward if those dates did not work. He offered to host the depositions at his office and suggested that both depositions could be completed on the same day.\n\nBryce followed up the same day, January 8, 2024, asking whether any progress had been made on scheduling Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition.\n\nIn subsequent exchanges on January 9, 2024, the parties refined the plan. Ryan noted that February 6 would be the date and asked for a preferred time, proposing the first deposition at 10:00 and the second at noon or thereafter. Bryce confirmed that Tuesday, February 6 would work best for all involved. He included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and a standard attorney-client privilege notice commonly attached to emails. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address listed was 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 364-9363. The communications also carried the customary disclaimer about privileged information and the instruction to contact the firm if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Bryce\u2019s December 7, 2023 request to depose Lucretia Vinsom had sought dates for her deposition, and Ryan\u2019s December 11, 2023 reply confirmed his belief that she remained a Norton employee and that he would check with her about deposition dates, while also noting an interest in deposing Mr. Prince if possible. By December 12, 2023, Sarena Tuttle had clarified that Mr. Prince was retired but available, and instructed the team to propose dates for his deposition. The communications reflect Ryan Nafziger\u2019s role in coordinating depositions and hosting arrangements, while Bryce Koon and Sarena Tuttle interacted with respect to who would be deposed and when.\n\nAcross these communications, the objective remained clear: schedule two depositions\u2014one for Lucretia Vinsom and one for Mr. Robert Prince\u2014on a single day to be determined, with February 6, 2024 as the proposed date, and to commence with the first deposition at 10:00 and the second at 12:00 or thereafter, with the depositions to be hosted at Ryan Nafziger\u2019s office if feasible. The notes also reflect the evolving availability: Ms. Vinsom\u2019s availability windows (January 29, 30; February 1, 2; and February 5\u20139) and her unavailability the week of February 12\u201316, and Mr. Prince\u2019s status as retired with open schedules.\n\nFor completeness, the communications include standard attorney-client privilege notices and new email address references for Sarena Tuttle, who signs as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, 21-CI-003798. The client is the Estate of Betty Prince. The correspondence centers on scheduling depositions of two potential witnesses: Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom and Mr. Robert Prince (the latter described as retired with open availability). The exchanges spanned December 2023 through January 2024 and involved counsel from The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce W. Koon, Esq.; Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager) and counsel from PPOA Law (Ryan Nafziger, Esq.; Joseph Effinger, Esq.; Andrea Higgins, Esq.), with the Whaley firm\u2019s contact details and the PPOA firm\u2019s contact details listed in the signatures. The messages also included standard attorney-client privilege disclosures in every electronic transmission, and Sarena Tuttle noted a new email address in her signature.\n\nThe discussion began on December 7, 2023, when Bryce Koon asked whether Norton employee Lucretia Vinsom remained with Norton and requested potential deposition dates. On December 11, 2023, Ryan Nafziger replied that Ms. Vinsom was still a Norton employee and that he would check with her to obtain deposition dates; he also indicated an interest in deposing Mr. Robert Prince if dates could be found. The following day, December 12, 2023, Sarena Tuttle responded that Mr. Prince is retired and has open availability, with no standing appointment to work around, and requested dates for deposing Mr. Prince.\n\nFurther scheduling back-and-forth continued through December 2023. On December 26, 2023, Bryce again asked for potential dates for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition, and on December 29, 2023, Ryan noted he was still working on obtaining dates and would respond the following week, wishing everyone a Happy New Year. By December 12, 2023, Sarena had already indicated that Mr. Prince\u2019s deposition could be scheduled given his retirement and available windows.\n\nIn early January 2024, the parties narrowed the window for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. On January 8, 2024, Ryan stated that Ms. Vinsom was available January 29, 30 and February 1, 2 and February 5\u20139, with a week of February 12\u201316 unavailable but the witness could be available afterward; he suggested arranging both depositions on the same day and hosting at his office. Bryce Koon replied later that day, asking for progress on securing dates for Ms. Vinsom\u2019s deposition. Ryan reaffirmed Ms. Vinsom\u2019s availability and again offered to host at his office, asking whether any of the listed dates would work for the client and whether both depositions could be done on the same day.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, Bryce indicated that Tuesday, February 6 would work best for all involved. Ryan then sought preference on the time for the day, proposing the first deposition at 10:00 a.m. and the second at noon or thereafter. The following day, January 10, 2024, Sarena replied that starting the day at 10:00 a.m. was perfect for their office and provided her contact information, including a new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and the firm\u2019s full contact details. The message also carried the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nIn summary, the parties settled on scheduling two depositions for Tuesday, February 6, 2024, with the planned sequence to begin at 10:00 a.m. for the first deposition and the second at 12:00 p.m. or later, to be conducted on the same day at Ryan Nafziger\u2019s office, pending confirmations of Ms. Vinsom\u2019s and Mr. Prince\u2019s availabilities. The correspondence repeatedly confirms Ms. Vinsom\u2019s status as a Norton employee and Mr. Prince\u2019s retirement with open availability, and all communications include the customary privilege notices and firm signatures.",

Norton Hospitals, docket number 21-CI-003798, in which the plaintiff is the Estate of Betty Prince.\n\nBetween October 16 and October 25, 2023, a series of email communications took place between counsel representing the Estate and counsel for Norton Hospitals regarding discovery and a protective order, with documents and records to be produced under that order. On Monday, October 16, 2023, at 3:01 p.m., Blake Gerstner of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC wrote to Bryce Koons of The Whaley Law Firm. He apologized for the delay and stated that attached please be found the defendant\u2019s discovery responses. He said they would forward a OneDrive link the next day containing the referenced medical records and bills, as well as a signed verification page, and that once the Agreed Protective Order had been entered they would forward the applicable documents. He concluded by inviting any questions or concerns, and his email included the customary confidentiality notice.\n\nLater the same afternoon, at 3:08 p.m., Bryce Koon responded: \u201cThank you for getting back to me. You may sign on our behalf.\u201d He signed off with his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm, including his Louisville address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone and fax numbers, and his electronic signature block. The message also contained the firm\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier that day, at 3:01 p.m., Blake had also noted in a separate message that they were in receipt of the outstanding discovery responses, had been diligently working on them, and would have the responses by the end of the day. He reiterated that some documents were confidential and reiterated the preference that Bryce execute the attached Agreed Protective Order to protect their client\u2019s interests; he added that if Bryce could not agree to the proposed order, they would still produce the documents with an agreement to keep them confidential while the Protective Order was litigated. This message also carried the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 5:06 p.m. on October 16, 2023, Blake sent another message reiterating that they had received the request for discovery responses and that they would have them by the end of the day. He explained that some of the documents were confidential and that they would prefer Bryce to execute the attached Agreed Protective Order; he also offered to e-sign for Bryce with permission. He confirmed that they had been diligently working on the responses and that once the Agreed Protective Order had been entered, they would forward the applicable documents. The email again included Blake\u2019s signature block and the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nMore than a week later, on Monday, October 16, 2023, at 3:01 p.m., Blake sent another message in the thread indicating that the parties were awaiting the protective order\u2019s entry and that the documents to be produced were confidential, with a proposed protective order to govern access. The tone throughout this sequence was to secure a protective order before sharing the confidential materials.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 25, 2023, at 10:01 a.m., Blake Gerstner again wrote to Bryce Koons regarding the same Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals matter. He apologized for the delay and attached the documents referenced in his previous email, produced pursuant to the agreed protective order, along with a one-drive link containing the Plaintiff\u2019s medical and billing records. He asked Bryce to review and to contact him if there were questions or concerns. The body of this email included the standard signature for Blake Gerstner, Associate Attorney, Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address (716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202), telephone and fax numbers, and the website w ppoalaw.com. It also included the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nThe emails also show the broader context of the correspondence, including the presence of standard confidentiality language in each message and the logistical details of production under the protective order. The subject line on these communications consistently read: \u201cEstate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798).\u201d The October 25 exchange was forwarded within the team: Bryce Koon forwarded Blake\u2019s October 25 message as \u201cFW: Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals (21-CI-003798)\u201d to Sarena Tuttle at sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, with a cc to bettyprincesfz954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, dated October 25, 2023, 10:37:03 -0400.\n\nAttachments and materials referenced across the chain included documents produced under the Agreed Protective Order, along with a one-drive link containing the Plaintiff\u2019s medical and billing records, and, in one message, a signed verification page. The communications also recorded the ongoing use of a protective order to govern the sharing and handling of confidential information, with the expectation that the protective order would be entered before full production of the documents.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects a coordinated discovery process in the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, centered on compliance with an Agreed Protective Order, the production of defendant discovery responses, and the provision of medical and billing records via a one-drive link to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, all within a sequence of dated emails from October 16 through October 25, 2023, including professional signatures and confidentiality notices typical of this practice.",

      "natural_language": "In the case captioned Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit Court, 21-CI-003798), the Estate of Betty Prince is the client. The matter concerns ongoing discovery disputes between counsel for the estate and counsel for Norton Hospitals. The principal participants in the email thread include Ryan Nafziger of PPOA Law, representing the estate, and Bryce Koon, Esq. of The Whaley Law Firm, along with Joseph Effinger (also of PPOA Law). The CC list across the exchanges includes the filevine email account for bettyprincesfz954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nThe communications unfolded as follows. On March 19, 2024, at 12:35 p.m., Bryce Koon sent an email to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with the subject referencing Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798). In that message, he stated that Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests were attached and asked to let him know if anything else was needed. A follow-up message shortly thereafter, at 12:36 p.m., from Bryce Koon contained the line, \u201cApologies \u2013 forgot to attach them!\u201d indicating an attachment issue. A separate prior message also appeared in the chain at 12:35 p.m. where Mr. Koon again advised that the Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests were attached and invited any further input, followed by the brief 12:36 p.m. follow-up noting the attachment oversight, with the standard attorney-client confidentiality disclaimer included in each email.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, at 10:43 a.m., Bryce Koon again wrote to counsel, this time advising, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just writing to follow up on the below requests. Please advise when we may expect responses in this regard.\u201d His signature block identified him as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with Louisville contact details, and a standard confidentiality notice was included in the message.\n\nThere is another April 22, 2024 entry at 10:43 a.m. that repeats the confidentiality language and the attorney contact information, consistent with the firm\u2019s email footer.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., Bryce Koon sent a further follow-up email: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I am again writing to follow up on the outstanding discovery requests. If I do not hear from you by Thursday, I will be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard.\u201d This message also carried his signing block with the same firm information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on May 2, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied to Bryce Koon and Joseph Effinger. In his message, Nafziger apologized for the late reply and stated that he was still waiting on some responsive information, but he hoped to have these materials to counsel by the end of the next week. This May 2, 2024 email was sent from Ryan Nafziger and was copied to Bryce Koon and Joseph Effinger, with the CC\u2019d recipients including bettyprincesfz954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Sarena Tuttle. The note\u2019s date and time were Thu, May 2, 2024, at 13:44:02 +0000.\n\nAcross these messages, the correspondence repeatedly references Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests and the estate\u2019s discovery timeline, with multiple follow-ups from The Whaley Law Firm about responses and a late-count response from the estate\u2019s counsel acknowledging the need for information and seeking to avoid a motion to compel. Each email contains the standard attorney-client confidentiality notice customary to such communications.",

      "natural_language": "In the case titled Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit Court, 21-CI-003798), the Estate of Betty Prince is represented by The Whaley Law Firm. The note documents a sequence of discovery communications between the firm and opposing counsel, spanning March through May 2024, with the matter tracked under the file Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020.\n\nOn March 19, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to opposing counsel at PPOA Law (rnafziger@ppoalaw.com and jeffinger@ppoalaw.com), with the subject Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798). In that message, he attached Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests and cc\u2019d the Estate\u2019s Filevine portal address bettyprincesfz954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Sarena Tuttle. Shortly after, at 12:36 PM on the same day, Koon followed up with a separate email apologizing that the attachments had not been included. The emails each carried The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the messages are intended only for the named recipient and that, if received in error, the recipient should contact the firm and not disclose or use privileged information.\n\nA little over a month later, on April 22, 2024, Koon again wrote to opposing counsel (to the same recipients, rnafziger and jeffinger, with the same subject line) to follow up on the requests. In that message, he stated, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just writing to follow up on the below requests. Please advise when we may expect responses in this regard,\u201d and he again signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and contact information (Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-364-9363). The message reiterated the standard attorney-client confidentiality notice.\n\nOn April 30, 2024, Koon sent another follow-up regarding the outstanding discovery requests. He wrote, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I am again writing to follow up on the outstanding discovery requests. If I do not hear from you by Thursday, I will be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard.\u201d This email also carried the Whaley Law Firm signature block and confidentiality notice.\n\nThe following day, May 2, 2024, Ryan Nafziger of PPOA Law replied to Bryce Koon. In his reply, Nafziger apologized for the late response, explained that he was still waiting on some responsive information, and stated that he hoped to have the information to Bryce by the end of the next week. Nafziger closed his message with a brief thank you. The thread continued with the standard email formatting and the confidentiality disclaimer included in the outgoing communications.\n\nIn summary, this note tracks a persistent discovery dispute in Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc., with plaintiff\u2019s counsel repeatedly requesting discovery responses, issuing warnings of a potential motion to compel if no timely reply, and opposing counsel replying on May 2, 2024, indicating that responsive information was still being gathered and would be provided by the end of the following week. The communications include multiple CCs to the Estate\u2019s Filevine portal and to Sarena Tuttle, and all messages incorporate the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc., Jefferson Circuit Court case 21-CI-003798, the plaintiff\u2019s estate pursued discovery through a series of emails between The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel in March and April 2024. The communications were sent by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s contact numbers: phone (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 364-9363. The to-addresses in the exchanges were rnafziger@ppoalaw.com and jeffinger@ppoalaw.com, and the cc\u2019d recipients included bettyprincesfz954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Sarena Tuttle at sarena@whaleylawfirm.com. Each email contained the standard attorney\u2011client privilege/confidentiality disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient, that it may contain privileged information, and instructions if received in error.\n\nThe first relevant email occurred on March 19, 2024. At 12:35 PM, Bryce Koon sent to opposing counsel (rn afziger@ppoalaw.com and jeffinger@ppoalaw.com) with the subject \u201cEstate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798).\u201d In that message, he stated: \u201cAttached please find Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests. If you need anything else from me in this regard, please let me know.\u201d The email was copied to the same cc recipients noted above. In a follow-up message just one minute later, at 12:36 PM, he wrote: \u201cApologies \u2013 forgot to attach them!\u201d indicating an attachment issue. The signature then listed his contact details and firm information, followed by the customary confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier that same day, March 19, 2024, at 12:35 PM, there was another message with the same subject line and sender, reiterating the content about the attached Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Requests and inviting the recipients to request anything additional. The email again included the same firm contact details and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn April 22, 2024, at 10:43 AM, Bryce Koon sent another email to opposing counsel with the subject: \u201cRE: Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals Inc. (Jefferson Circuit 21-CI-003798).\u201d In this message, he wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just writing to follow up on the below requests. Please advise when we may expect responses in this regard.\u201d The email again carried the same firm signature block and confidentiality disclaimer, with the same addressees and CCs.\n\nFinally, on April 30, 2024, at 11:00:11 AM Eastern Daylight Time, Koon sent a further follow-up to opposing counsel: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I am again writing to follow up on the outstanding discovery requests. If I do not hear from you by Thursday, I will be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard.\u201d This message also included the standard confidentiality notice and listed the same recipients.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes a sequence of emails in the Estate-of Betty Prince case against Norton Hospitals, Inc. (Jefferson County, Jefferson 21-CI-003798). The client is the Estate of Betty Prince. The correspondence involves W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Ryan Nafziger, with the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 listed in the cc as a Filevine project email address (BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The matter concerns discovery issues, specifically documents about Ms. Vinson\u2019s training as a registration clerk and related responses, with standard attorney-client privilege notices included in the messages.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, Bryce Koon sent a message to opposing counsel, stating, \u201cPlease see the attached correspondence.\u201d The email carried the Whaley Law Firm letterhead, including the firm\u2019s Louisville office address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone number 502-365-5043 and fax number 502-237-3207, and it contained the usual confidentiality and privilege disclaimer instructing that the message is for the named recipient and should not be forwarded if received in error.\n\nOn July 9, 2024, Bryce wrote again to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger (cc\u2019ing the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 - Filevine Project Email Address). He recalled a phone conversation and said he was under the impression a more detailed explanation of the objections would follow by email, but he had not received it. He requested an update.\n\nThe following day, July 10, 2024, Ryan responded to Bryce, indicating he was still looking into the policies discussed on the phone. He confirmed that his client did not have any security footage of Bryce\u2019s client and noted he would be out of town for mediation for the next few days but would try to follow up shortly with those policies. Bryce replied, \u201cSounds good. Thank you for getting back to me.\u201d\n\nOn July 25, 2024, Bryce sent another follow-up to Ryan, again requesting an update and noting that he had not yet received the requested documents or a response to his prior letter.\n\nOn July 31, 2024, Bryce wrote again with greater urgency: \u201cGood afternoon Ryan, I still have not received any documents regarding Ms. Vinson\u2019s training as a registration clerk or response to my previous letter. Please respond to the letter or provide the requested documents as soon as possible. If I do not receive this information promptly, I will be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard.\u201d This message, like the others, included the standard attorney-client privilege notice and was cc\u2019d to the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 via the Filevine project email address and to the general Estate file. Ryan replied later that day, stating he was still working on the matter and trying to ensure an accurate understanding of what training Ms. Vinsom (as he spelled it) received as a registration clerk before formally answering the letter.\n\nThroughout the thread, the subject line consistently read: \u201cEstate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, Inc. (Jefferson 21-CI-003798).\u201d The messages reflect an ongoing dispute over discovery related to Ms. Vinson\u2019s training and related documents, with counsel pausing to gather and verify policies and any available training records before providing a formal response.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, Inc. (Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 21-CI-003798), the estate\u2019s counsel, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, prepared and circulated a series of discovery and filing communications beginning in late June 2024. The case file, designated Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020, shows that the client is the Estate of Betty Prince.\n\nOn June 26, 2024, at 12:56 PM, Bryce Koon sent a message attaching correspondence related to the matter. The note included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer common to electronic communications from the firm. The email flagged ongoing issues and served as a prelude to further discovery exchanges.\n\nThe next sequence of exchanges centers on the discovery dispute regarding Ms. Vinson\u2019s training as a registration clerk. On July 9, 2024, at 4:21 PM, Koon wrote to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger (with a cc to the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address) noting that he recalled discussions by phone about the issues and that he had been under the impression a more detailed explanation of the objections would follow by email, but had not yet received it. He requested an update.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, at 10:25 AM, Ryan Nafziger replied that he was still looking into the policies discussed on the phone and could confirm that his client did not possess any security footage of the claimant. He explained that he was out of town for mediation for the next few days and would try to follow up soon with those policies. Bryce Koon responded at 10:26 AM, saying, \u201cSounds good. Thank you for getting back to me.\u201d The email chain also included the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nLater on July 10, 2024, at 3:33 PM, Bryce Koon again reached out to Nafziger, expressing a desire to follow up on the issues and requesting an update.\n\nOn July 25, 2024, at 3:33 PM (as reflected in the chain), Bryce Koon sent another follow-up message to Nafziger requesting progress on the matter.\n\nOn July 31, 2024, at 12:53 PM, Nafziger responded that he was still working on the matter and was trying to ensure an accurate understanding of what training Ms. Vinson received while a registration clerk before formally answering the letter.\n\nThen, on September 3, 2024, at 11:26 AM, Bryce Koon wrote again stating that he had not yet received any documents regarding Ms. Vinson\u2019s training as a registration clerk or a response to the earlier letter. He warned that if the information was not provided promptly, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. This message also carried the firm\u2019s privilege disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on September 10, 2024, at 10:32:17 AM, Bryce Koon sent a message to counsel noting that the attached filing had been filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court and was set for Monday\u2019s motion hour. The email included the same attorney-client privileged disclaimer and provided Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone and fax numbers listed.\n\nThroughout the thread, the participants were: Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm) as the sender in the estate matter; recipients included Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with a cc to the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 via a Filevine project email address. All emails carried the customary disclaimers regarding privilege and instructions if received in error.\n\nIn summary, the estate\u2019s counsel pursued discovery related to Ms. Vinson\u2019s training as a registration clerk, repeatedly requesting production of documents and clarification, while simultaneously filing and noting a matter set for motion in Jefferson Circuit Court on the pending docket of Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Hospitals, Inc.",

Norton Healthcare and the scheduling of Donna Jones, RN, of DSJ & Associates, as a witness for deposition.\n\nIn February 2025, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, reached out to Donna Jones, RN, of DSJ & Associates, about the Estate of Betty Prince. Tuttle reminded Jones that, in October or November 2021, Jones reviewed medical records for Betty Prince after she fell during a doctor visit at Norton Healthcare, an event that ultimately contributed to Prince\u2019s passing. Tuttle stated that she had attached a copy of Jones\u2019s statement for reference. With trial approaching, Tuttle explained that Jones\u2019s deposition would need to be taken before the scheduling order was issued and asked Jones to provide dates in April when she would be available to testify. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details listed for Tuttle were: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting the address of the new email address.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, Sarena Tuttle wrote again, this time with the subject Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, to Donna Jones. In her message, she reiterated that Jones had reviewed the medical records related to Prince\u2019s fall and death at Norton Healthcare in late 2021 and stated that a copy of Jones\u2019s statement was attached. Tuttle reiterated the urgency due to the approaching trial date and again asked Jones to provide dates in April when she would be available to complete the deposition.\n\nA separate exchange occurred on March 14, 2025. In an email to Donna Jones with the subject Re: Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, Sarena Tuttle followed up to request the best dates and times for Jones\u2019s deposition and asked Jones to contact the office to discuss the matter in further detail. Tuttle again provided her contact information and noted the new email address.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Donna Jones responded. She apologized for the delay in replying and advised that her available dates for deposition were May 2, May 6, and May 8. She asked to be informed as soon as possible so she could place the deposition on the calendar. Jones also stated that the only records she possessed were Betty Prince\u2019s records from Norton Health. If the recipient had additional records\u2014such as Norton\u2019s policies and procedures or any depositions taken\u2014Jones requested that they be forwarded to her for review. She closed with thanks and respect, including her professional signature and contact information: Donna Jones, RN, DSJ & Associates, 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525, donna@dsjandassociates.com, dsjandassociates.com, 404-290-2733 (cell). A standard confidentiality disclaimer followed, indicating the message was intended only for the addressees and that disclosure, use, or dissemination by others was prohibited, with instructions to destroy or delete the message and notify the sender if the recipient was not an intended addressee.\n\nOverall, the thread shows a sequence of requests for deposition dates, with a focus on April availability initially requested, followed by Donna Jones\u2019s later availability in early May, and a reminder to share any additional Norton Health records or depositions to aid Jones\u2019s review.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter labeled Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020, the Estate of Betty Prince is represented in the case against Norton Healthcare by The Whaley Law Firm. The primary point of contact in these communications is Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at the firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her work email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and she notes this as the new address. The emails involve coordination with Donna Jones of DSJ & Associates, based in Brunswick, Georgia, and include Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm in copies where appropriate.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent an email to Donna Jones regarding deposition scheduling for the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare. In that message, she referenced the fact that, in October/November 2021, Donna Jones had reviewed medical records for Betty Prince after she fell during a doctor visit at Norton Healthcare, an incident that ultimately led to Betty Prince\u2019s death. Sarena attached a copy of Donna\u2019s statement for reference and noted that, with trial dates approaching, it would be necessary to depose Donna prior to the scheduling order being issued. She requested that Donna provide dates in April when she would be available for the deposition and provided her contact information in case further discussion was needed.\n\nA follow-up from Sarena Tuttle on March 14, 2025 reiterated the request for the best dates and times for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and asked Donna to contact the office to discuss the matter in more detail. The message was sent to Donna Jones with Bryce Koon cc\u2019d, and it included Sarena\u2019s contact details and new email address.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Donna Jones replied. She apologized for the delay and provided her available dates: May 2, May 6, and May 8. She asked to be advised as soon as possible so she could put the deposition on the calendar. Donna also noted that the only records she currently possessed were Betty Prince\u2019s Norton Health records, and she requested that if The Whaley Law Firm had additional records\u2014such as Norton Health policies/procedures or any depositions\u2014these be forwarded to her for review. Donna identified herself as Donna Jones, RN, of DSJ & Associates, with mailing address 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525, and provided her email (donna@dsjandassociates.com) and phone number (404-290-2733). Her message included the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of such communications.\n\nFollowing Donna\u2019s response, on March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied that they would forward the proposed deposition dates to Norton Healthcare\u2019s defense counsel to determine which date works best for all parties, and that they would reach out with a confirmation as soon as more information is available. This final note documented the ongoing coordination and confirmed that the new email address for Sarena was in use. The message was signed by Sarena with the same professional titles and Firm details as before.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020. Client: Estate of Betty Prince. Re: Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare \u2013 Deposition Scheduling. This matter concerns scheduling depositions in the Estate of Betty Prince v. Norton Healthcare, with the Whaley Law Firm handling the litigation and the estate as client.\n\nThe earliest communication in the thread began on December 3, 2024, when Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mr. Ryan Nafziger and cc\u2019d Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley. In that message, titled Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling, Sarena stated that the office would like to take the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the representative and the dates on which that representative would be available to be deposed. She closed by inviting any questions and offering further discussion. Her contact information included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nOn December 5, 2024 at approximately 1:04 PM, Ryan Nafziger responded to that thread. He asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and requested that it be resent if it had not. He also requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones at that time.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, on December 5, 2024, Nafziger\u2019s message was followed by Sarena Tuttle\u2019s earlier email trail initiating the deposition scheduling. In the December 3, 2024 message, Sarena explicitly proposed taking Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under 30(b)(6) and asked the opposing side to provide the name of the representative and the available deposition dates, so the parties could move forward with scheduling.\n\nFast forwarding to March 18, 2025, there are two more exchanges. At 10:44? AM on March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied to the scheduling discussion. He stated that they had been unable to reach Ms. Donna Jones for potential deposition dates, but added that they would like to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative. He attached a proposed notice for the 30(b)(6) deposition and asked the other side to review the notice and provide deposition dates at their earliest convenience. Bryce also provided his contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. His message included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer typical of Electronic Communications from The Whaley Law Firm, noting the message is intended only for the named recipient and that it may contain privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact the firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nLater on March 18, 2025, at 12:48:48 GMT-04:00, Sarena M. Tuttle sent another update. She informed counsel that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, who is available on May 2, May 6, or May 8. She asked which of these dates works best for the office and the client. Sarena signed as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm and included her contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting the new email address.\n\nIn the same March 18, 2025 thread, the email from Bryce Koon earlier that morning confirmed that Donna Jones had not yet been reachable for deposition scheduling. He reiterated the need for dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and reminded recipients that a proposed notice had been attached for their review. He again requested that dates be provided at their earliest convenience and closed with his usual contact details and the firm\u2019s standard disclaimer.\n\nThe full set of communications reflects a coordinated effort over several months to schedule Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative deposition under 30(b)(6) and to obtain dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition, with January\u2013March 2025 activity culminating in Donna Jones\u2019s available dates of May 2, 6, or 8 being proposed for scheduling, and ongoing discussion about the appropriate 30(b)(6) deposition notice. The parties involved include the Estate of Betty Prince as the client, The Whaley Law Firm representing the plaintiff, Norton Healthcare as the defendant, and the counsel named above, with the Filevine project email BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com copied in the original chain. The parties\u2019 contact details and the case\u2019s procedural posture (30(b)(6) deposition, Donna Jones deposition dates, and proposed deposition notice) are consistently reflected throughout the thread.",

He asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and requested that it be resent if it had been issued. He also requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones at that time. The record does not show resolutions to those requests within this excerpt, but it documents the sequence of communications aimed at scheduling these depositions.\n\nIn sum, the deposition scheduling efforts in this case span December 2024 to March 2025, revolving around obtaining a 30(b)(6) corporate representative deposition for Norton Healthcare (and the related CR 30.02(6) deposition), identifying the appropriate corporate representative, securing available deposition dates, and specifically arranging the deposition of Donna Jones, while also coordinating with counsel and providing the standard confidentiality notices customary to electronic communications among the parties.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, captioned Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020 with the client listed as the Estate of Betty Prince, the parties were coordinating deposition scheduling for a 30(b)(6) deposition of Norton Healthcare. The communications span from December 2024 through March 2025 and involve The Whaley Law Firm and Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Mr. Nafziger and Mr. Effinger, with Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley copied, regarding the deposition of a Norton Healthcare Corporate Representative under Rule 30(b)(6) of the Kentucky Civil Rules (CR 30.02(6)). She asked Norton Healthcare to provide the name of the corporate representative and the dates on which that representative would be available to be deposed. She invited any questions and offered to discuss details further. The message included her contact information and noted a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the phone numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied. He asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and, if so, to resend it. He also requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones. His message also included his contact details and a confidentiality disclaimer for The Whaley Law Firm, and it identified him as part of Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel.\n\nThen, on March 3, 2025, the correspondence continued with another thread. On Tuesday, December 3, 2024 at 11:19 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Mr. Nafziger and CC\u2019d Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley. She stated that the office wished to take the deposition of a Norton Healthcare corporate representative under 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the representative and the available dates for deposition. She ended by reiterating her willingness to discuss any questions and provided her contact information, including her new email address.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 10:44 AM, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied. He wrote, \u201cGood morning counsel, Unfortunately, we have been unable to reach Ms. Jones for potential deposition dates. However, we would like to get dates for your corporate representative. Attached is the proposed notice in this regard. Please review and provide dates for deposition at your earliest convenience.\u201d He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and provided his phone number, Fax number, and a confidentiality notice stating the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information. He also noted that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or use any of the information.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:48 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle responded to Counsel, providing an update. She wrote, \u201cGood afternoon Counselors, Just an update, that we have now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones. She is available May 2nd, 6th or 8th. Which of these dates works best for your office and Client?\u201d Her signature line reiterated her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, including the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: (502) 357-9971), office line (O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104), and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating the email address is new.\n\nIn sum, the parties sought to schedule a deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under CR 30.02(6), with initial requests and proposals exchanged in December 2024, and subsequent follow-up in March 2025 after obtaining information regarding Donna Jones. Donna Jones was identified as the deponent with available dates of May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, as communicated by Sarena Tuttle on March 18, 2025.",

In the matter captioned Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the Whaley Law Firm pursued deposition scheduling for both Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under FRCP 30(b)(6) and Nurse Donna Jones.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Mr. Nafziger and Mr. Effinger (with Bryce Koon copied) requesting the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under 30(b)(6). She asked for the name of the representative and the dates they would be available to be deposed, inviting any questions and offering to discuss them further.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied.

He added that they would like to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative, and attached a proposed notice for that purpose, asking the recipients to review it and provide deposition dates at their earliest convenience.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded. She noted that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, who is available on May 2, May 6, or May 8. She asked which of these dates would work best for the recipient\u2019s office and client.

She reiterated the prior note that Donna Jones had availability on May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, but that the dates had not yet been confirmed with counsel or Ms. Jones. She warned that these dates could fill up soon if confirmation was not provided, and she once again asked the recipients to confirm which of the listed dates would work for their office and the client. The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm with the same contact details and included the standard notice about attorney-client privileged material, along with the CC\u2019d and copied addresses, including the Betty Prince Filevine project email and other recipients.",

      "natural_language": "The Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare is being handled by The Whaley Law Firm on behalf of the Estate of Betty Prince. The case file, labeled Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020, involves deposition scheduling for Norton Healthcare, with Donna Jones (a nurse) and a Norton Healthcare corporate representative being discussed for depositions under 30(b)(6). The correspondence began in December 2024 and continued through March 2025, involving plaintiff counsel Sarena M. Tuttle and defense counsel W. Bryce Koon, among others.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mr. Nafziger (and copied Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley) requesting the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s Corporate Representative under Rule 30(b)(6). She asked for the name of the representative and the dates on which that person would be available for deposition. The message was signed with Sarena\u2019s full contact information, noting her new email address. The message stated: \u201cGood morning Mr. Nafziger, At this time, our office would like to take the deposition of a Corporate Representative of Norton Healthcare under 30(b)(6). Please provide the name of the representative and dates they are available to be deposed. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\u201d The email was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address).\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied. He asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones as well. The message effectively sought a proposed notice for the corporate representative deposition and simultaneously requested scheduling information for Donna Jones.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, there were two separate exchanges. At 10:44 a.m., Bryce Koon, Esq., responding for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote that they had been unable to reach Ms. Jones for potential deposition dates but that they would like to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative. He attached a proposed notice for the corporate representative deposition and asked counsel to review and provide deposition dates at their earliest convenience. His message included his standard firm contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207; with the signature of W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and the typical disclaimer block included in attorney communications.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied with an update: Norton Healthcare\u2019s Corporate Representative deposition dates had now been received from Donna Jones. She stated that Ms. Jones was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and she asked which of these dates would work best for the office and the client. Her message again carried her signature block with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information, and it included a note indicating that her email address had changed (Pleas note: \u201cE: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\u201d with the reminder about the new address).\n\nMeanwhile, the initial thread shows an ongoing effort to coordinate with Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel. In the same March 18, 2025 timeframe, the original message from December 3, 2024 and the December 5, 2024 follow-up reflect the parties\u2019 efforts to schedule the corporate deposition under 30(b)(6) and to obtain dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition. The chain also documents that the March 18 messages included a standard attorney-client disclaimer in Bryce Koon\u2019s email, underscoring the privileged nature of the communication.\n\nFinally, on March 25, 2025, the latest note in the thread titled \u201cRe: Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling\u201d shows Sarena Tuttle following up with counsel. The message reiterates that Donna Jones had been identified as available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, but that the office had not yet received confirmation. It states: \u201cGood morning Counselors, We just wanted to touch base on the dates for Nurse Donna Jones, last week we advised that she is available May 2nd, 6th or 8th, yet have not received a response. We are confident these dates will fill up soon if we are unable to get a confirmation over to her. Please confirm if any of these dates work for your office & schedule.\u201d The email is signed by Sarena M. Tuttle with the same Whaley Law Firm contact details and again notes her new email address.\n\nIn sum, the deposition scheduling efforts in this matter have focused on securing dates for Donna Jones (Nurse Jones) on May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, while also pursuing dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under 30(b)(6). The correspondence shows initial inquiries in December 2024, subsequent follow-ups in March 2025, and a final follow-up in March 25, 2025, all with the relevant parties\u2019 contact details and the customary legal disclaimers where applicable.",

The following email communications between Donna Jones, RN, of DSJ & Associates, and Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, relate to scheduling Donna Jones\u2019s deposition in connection with Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, at 3:48 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent an email to Mrs. Jones explaining that in October/November of 2021, Mrs. Jones reviewed medical records for the referenced client after she fell during a Doctor visit at Norton Healthcare, an event that ultimately led to the client\u2019s passing. Sarena noted that she attached a copy of Mrs. Jones\u2019s statement for reference. She stated that, as the trial date approached, they would need to take Mrs. Jones\u2019s deposition prior to the scheduling order being issued and asked Mrs. Jones to provide dates in April when she would be available for deposition.\n\nIn a follow-up, dated February 24, 2025, Sarena reiterated the request for April availability and attached Mrs. Jones\u2019s statement for reference.\n\nOn Friday, March 14, 2025, at 2:49 PM, Sarena again wrote to Mrs. Jones, asking to follow up on the request for the best dates and times for the deposition and advised Mrs. Jones to contact the office to discuss the matter in further detail. The email was sent from The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s contact details and a note indicating the recipient should contact the office to discuss scheduling.\n\nOn Monday, March 17, 2025, at 7:32 AM, Donna Jones replied. She apologised for the delay and stated that she was available on May 2, May 6, and May 8. She asked to be informed as soon as possible so she could put the deposition on her calendar. She also noted that the only records she possessed were Betty Prince\u2019s records from Norton Health. If there were other records (e.g., Norton\u2019s policies/procedures or any depositions taken), she requested that those be forwarded to her for review. Her message concluded with thanks and her standard sign-off, including her contact information for DSJ & Associates at 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525, donna@dsjandassociates.com, and 404-290-2733 (cell). A confidentiality notice followed, stating that the message is intended only for the addressees and may contain privileged or confidential information; dissemination or use by anyone other than the addressee is prohibited, and recipients should destroy the message if they are not the intended recipient.\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 12:46 PM, Sarena responded to Mrs. Jones. She thanked Mrs. Jones and said they would forward the proposed dates to the Defense Counsel to determine which date works best for all parties. She added that as soon as there is more information, they would reach out with a confirmation. This message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm and carried the firm\u2019s updated email address, along with the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, March 14, 2025, the prior note in the chain from Sarena (as described above) stated the request for the best deposition dates and times and asked Mrs. Jones to contact the office to discuss in further detail.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, March 26, 2025, at 19:56:21 +0000, Donna Jones sent a reply to Sarena. She requested that Sarena inform her as soon as possible whether any of the dates she had provided\u2014May 2, May 6, and May 8\u2014would work for the deposition. Donna explained she was organizing her calendar for April and May and had several other commitments being thrust upon her. She warned that if she could not obtain timely confirmation from the defense, she would not be able to commit to the deposition until sometime in June. Donna closed with thanks for prompt assistance and her customary sign-off, followed by her confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nDonna Jones\u2019s contact information appeared with her signature: Donna Jones, RN, DSJ & Associates, 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525, donna@dsjandassociates.com, Dsjandassociates.com, 404-290-2733 (cell). The message also included the standard confidentiality notice indicating the message is intended only for the addressees, may contain privileged and confidential information, and that any use or dissemination by non-addressees is prohibited and should be destroyed or the sender advised.\n\nIn sum, the deposition scheduling communications between Donna Jones and Sarena Tuttle circulated from February 24, 2025 through March 26, 2025, with initial deposition date requests for April, subsequent discussions of May dates (May 2, 6, 8), updates about forwarding proposed dates to defense counsel for confirmation, and a final request for confirmation from Donna about whether any of the May dates would work, given her calendar constraints and the possibility of a June deposition if timely defense feedback could not be obtained. Each exchange included a standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of the parties\u2019 communications.",

      "natural_language": "The Estate of Betty Prince is pursuing a case against Norton Healthcare, titled Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, with the client identified as the Estate of Betty Prince. This note collects a series of email exchanges from late February to late March 2025 between the Whaley Law Firm, representing the estate, and Donna Jones of DSJ & Associates, regarding scheduling the deposition of Donna Jones in connection with the case. The correspondence repeatedly references the deposition dates May 2, May 6, and May 8, and notes that the deposition must occur before the scheduling order for trial is issued. The communications also mention that Donna Jones had previously reviewed medical records from Norton Health related to Betty Prince\u2019s fall and subsequent passing, in October/November 2021, and that a statement from Donna was attached to one of the messages.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Mrs. Donna Jones, RN, at DSJ & Associates. She explained that Betty Prince\u2019s case was approaching a trial date and that Donna\u2019s deposition would need to be taken prior to the scheduling order. The message noted that Donna had previously reviewed Betty Prince\u2019s medical records from Norton Health after her fall during a doctor visit, which contributed to the subsequent passing. A copy of Donna\u2019s statement was attached for reference. Sarena requested dates in April when Donna would be available to complete the deposition.\n\nA follow-up was sent on March 14, 2025, from Sarena to Donna Jones. The message stated, \u201cGood afternoon Ms. Jones, We just wanted to follow up with you on our request for the best dates & times for your deposition. Please contact our office to discuss this in further detail.\u201d The email included Sarena\u2019s contact information and reiterated the firm\u2019s request for available deposition dates.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Donna Jones replied. She apologized for the delay and stated that her available dates included May 2, May 6, and May 8. She asked to be informed as soon as possible so she could place the deposition on her calendar. Donna also noted that the only records she had at that time were from Betty Prince\u2019s Norton Health records; she requested that the Whaley firm forward any additional records to review, such as Norton\u2019s policies and procedures or any depositions that had already been taken.\n\nThe following day, March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle responded. She explained that the dates Donna provided would be forwarded to the Defense Counsel to see which date works best for all parties, and that as soon as more information was available, she would reach out with a confirmation.\n\nLater, on March 26, 2025, Donna Jones sent another message asking for a prompt determination. She reiterated the May 2, 6, and 8 dates and explained that she needed to adjust her April and May calendar due to other commitments. She added that if she could not obtain timely confirmation from the defense, she would not be able to commit to the deposition until sometime in June.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied. She stated that she had already sent a follow-up to the defense and would send another one immediately, and that she would update Donna as soon as she heard back. She cautioned not to miss any commitments on their behalf and noted that if it became necessary to use the proposed May dates and push into June, they would work that out. She expressed appreciation for Donna\u2019s assistance and did not intend to hinder her. Sarena signed the email with her position as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm and included her new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky office details.\n\nThe exchanges include standard confidentiality language typical of the communications, indicating that the messages contain privileged information for the addressees and should be kept confidential. The parties\u2019 contact details appear in the signatures: Donna Jones\u2019s information lists DSJ & Associates at 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525, with the email donna@dsjandassociates.com, the website dsjandassociates.com, and the phone number 404-290-2733 (cell). Sarena Tuttle\u2019s signature lists The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the direct line 502-357-9971, the office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104, and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address). The case documents also reference the broader legal context, including the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare and the anticipated setting of deposition dates ahead of a scheduling order governing the trial.\n\nIn sum, between February and March 2025, the Whaley Law Firm and Donna Jones coordinated deposition availability for Donna Jones, with May 2, May 6, and May 8 identified as potential dates, while balancing the need to forward proposed dates to defense counsel and to secure timely confirmations before the scheduling order is issued for the trial. The correspondence also highlights Donna\u2019s prior involvement with Betty Prince\u2019s Norton Health records and requests for any additional documents to inform the deposition review, all within the framework of standard confidential communications.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter captioned Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the case is listed as Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020, with the client identified as the Estate of Betty Prince. The original deposition-scheduling communications were conducted by The Whaley Law Firm, with Sarena M. Tuttle acting as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager. The purpose of the email thread was to arrange depositions, including a 30(b)(6) deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and the deposition of Nurse Donna Jones.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle sent the first request to counsel for Norton Healthcare, asking that Norton Healthcare provide the name of its corporate representative for a 30(b)(6) deposition and furnish dates when that representative would be available to be deposed. The message was addressed to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with copying to Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine project email address, and Donna Jones. The email closed with Sarena\u2019s contact information and a note indicating her new email address.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied. He asked whether a proposed notice under CR 30.02(6) had already been sent and requested that it be resent if it had not yet been forwarded. He also requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones, and the exchange included the same parties as in the prior message.\n\nFast forward to March 18, 2025, at 10:44 a.m., Bryce Koon responded to the ongoing scheduling effort. He explained that Norton Healthcare had been unable to reach Ms. Donna Jones to confirm deposition dates, but he stated a desire to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative as well. He attached a proposed notice in that regard and asked that the receiving counsel review it and provide dates for the corporate deposition at their earliest convenience.\n\nLater on March 18, 2025 at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied with an update regarding Donna Jones. She informed that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, who was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8. She asked which of those dates would work best for the offices and the client.\n\nA week later, on March 25, 2025 at 10:09 a.m., Sarena sent another follow-up. She noted that they had previously advised that Donna Jones was available on May 2, May 6, and May 8, but they had not yet received a response. She warned that these dates would likely fill up soon if a confirmation could not be provided, and she again asked counsel to confirm whether any of the dates would work for their office and schedule.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025 at 1:46:56 p.m. (GMT-04:00), Sarena sent a concluding reminder. She stated that they were once again requesting confirmation or denial of Norton Healthcare\u2019s availability for Donna Jones\u2019 deposition. She noted that the dates Donna Jones provided\u2014May 2, May 6, and May 8\u2014had been shared on March 18, 2025, and that no response had been received. She requested that counsel check their calendars and respond, explaining that Donna Jones had other commitments she would like to schedule around the remaining dates. She also informed that Donna Jones had been CC\u2019d into the conversation to facilitate the quickest reservation possible.\n\nThe communications consistently reflect The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s efforts to schedule depositions for the Estate of Betty Prince, including the 30(b)(6) corporate representative deposition for Norton Healthcare and the deposition of Nurse Donna Jones, with ongoing follow-ups through March 2025. The correspondence includes the standard firm signature of Sarena M. Tuttle, including her phone numbers, the note about her new email address, and the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address.",

      "natural_language": "In the case titled Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the Estate of Betty Prince is the client, and the matter is titled Re: Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling. The Whaley Law Firm represents the estate, and the file header identifies the case as Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020 with the client listed as the Estate of Betty Prince. On December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mr. Ryan Nafziger and Mr. Joseph Effinger, with copies to Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, the \u201cEstate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 - Filevine Project Email Address,\u201d and Donna Jones, seeking to schedule the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6). The email asked for the name of the Norton Healthcare representative and dates on which the representative would be available, and it invited any questions and contact details for discussion. The message included Sarena\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note stating \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied, inquiring whether a proposed CR 30.02(6) deposition notice had been sent and requesting dates for the deposition of Donna Jones at that time.\n\nThe chain of messages also includes prior and contemporaneous exchanges. On December 3, 2024, Sarena Tuttle\u2019s message to Mr. Nafziger\u2014and to the same recipients mentioned above\u2014stated the intent to take the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s Corporate Representative under 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the representative and dates they were available, encouraging contact if there were questions and providing Sarena\u2019s contact information.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger\u2019s reply asked about sending a proposed CR 30.02(6) deposition notice and requested dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 10:44 a.m., Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm wrote that Norton Healthcare had been unable to reach Donna Jones for potential deposition dates and that they would like dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative; he attached a proposed notice and asked for review and the provision of deposition dates at the earliest convenience.\n\nLater that same day, March 18, 2025 at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, who was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8; she asked which of those dates would work best for the opposing office and the client, and she reaffirmed her contact details.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, at 10:09 a.m., Sarena sent another message noting that they had previously advised Donna Jones was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, but had not received a response, and she requested confirmation whether any of those dates would work for the opposing office and scheduling.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025, at 1:46 p.m., Sarena sent a further follow-up requesting confirmation or denial of the availability for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition. She noted that the dates May 2, May 6, and May 8 had been provided on March 18, 2025, and that Donna Jones has other commitments she would like to schedule for the remaining dates. She stated that Donna Jones had been cc\u2019d into the conversation for the quickest reservation possible.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications reflect ongoing efforts to schedule the deposition of Donna Jones\u2014the nurse identified as Mrs. Donna Jones\u2014and, separately, to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative\u2019s deposition under 30(b)(6). The signature blocks in these messages show the involved attorneys and staff, including Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, with the office address and contact details cited above, and Bryce Koon, also with The Whaley Law Firm, providing his contact information and confirming the firm\u2019s representation. The email thread demonstrates a back-and-forth timeline from December 2024 through March 2025, culminating in a request for firm confirmation of Donna Jones\u2019s availability for deposition on the specified May dates, with the understanding that Jones has other commitments and that timely scheduling is sought.",

      "natural_language": "The case file Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020 concerns the Estate of Betty Prince and the matter titled Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, specifically the deposition scheduling for Norton Healthcare. The note\u2019s narrative begins with a Decemeber 3, 2024 email from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, to counsel for Norton Healthcare (Ryan Nafziger, Joseph Effinger, and Andrea Higgins), with Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, Donna Jones, and an Estate of Betty Prince Filevine project email address cc\u2019d. The purpose stated was to identify Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative for a 30(b)(6) deposition, including the name of the representative and the dates on which they were available to be deposed.\n\nIn that same thread, the later message from Ryan Nafziger on December 5, 2024 asked whether a proposed notice for a CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and requested dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition. The email chain includes the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer common to these communications, and it lists the participants and contact details in the signatures. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s emails consistently reference their Louisville, Kentucky office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, along with direct line 502-357-9971, main office line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting that it is her new email address.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the exchange shifts to Donna Jones, a nurse, with Bryce Koon indicating that Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel had not yet been reached for potential deposition dates and that dates for a corporate representative deposition were also being sought; he attached a proposed notice and asked counsel to review and provide dates for the deposition at their earliest convenience. In the same exchange, the chain confirms an available schedule for Ms. Donna Jones: May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025. Following this, Sarena Tuttle sent a message on March 18, 2025 at 12:48 PM updating that the dates for Ms. Jones had been received and asking which of the May dates would work best for the offices and the client.\n\nSubsequently, on March 25, 2025 at approximately 10:09 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent another follow-up noting that Donna Jones had provided availability for May 2, 6, or 8, but there had been no confirmation from opposing counsel and warning that those dates could fill up quickly if not reserved promptly. The message again urged confirmation of any of those dates.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025 at 2:32 PM, Sarena Tuttle addressed Andrea Higgins directly, apologizing for not having copied Andrea on the prior emails regarding the Donna Jones deposition scheduling, and requesting Andrea\u2019s confirmation of whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger would be available on May 2, 6, or 8, 2025. The email was sent with the same set of recipients and CCs as before, including the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine address and Donna Jones. The thread shows ongoing efforts to schedule the depositions of Ms. Donna Jones and a Norton Healthcare corporate representative, with Donna Jones\u2019s availability confirmed for May 2, May 6, or May 8, and the need to confirm the specific dates with the counsel representing the estate.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the client is the Estate of Betty Prince, and the case is tagged as Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. As part of deposition scheduling, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle corresponded with opposing counsel and others to arrange depositions for Donna Jones, the nurse, and for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6).\n\nThe first relevant exchange occurred on December 3, 2024, when Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, requested that Norton Healthcare identify the corporate representative to be deposed under 30(b)(6) and provide the representative\u2019s name and available dates. The email was sent to Mr. Nafziger and others, with copies to Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, and Donna Jones\u2019s file-address contacts, and was part of the ongoing Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare deposition scheduling.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger asked whether a proposed notice under CR 30.02(6) had been sent, and he requested dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition at that time.\n\nFast forward to March 18, 2025: Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm wrote in the morning that they had been unable to reach Ms. Jones for potential deposition dates but wished to obtain deposition dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative instead. He attached a proposed notice for the corporate representative deposition and asked counsel to review it and provide dates at their earliest convenience.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, confirming she was available on May 2nd, 6th, or 8th, and asked which of these dates would work best for the opposing office and their client.\n\nOn March 25, 2025 at 10:09 a.m., Sarena followed up again, noting that Donna Jones had been advised as available on May 2nd, 6th, or 8th, and requesting confirmation if any of these dates would work for the opposing counsel\u2019s office and schedule.\n\nA further follow-up came on March 27, 2025, at about 1:46 p.m., when Sarena reiterated the request for confirmation or denial of Donna Jones\u2019s deposition availability. She reminded that the dates had been provided on March 18, 2025, and added that Jones has other commitments she would like to accommodate, cc\u2019ing her to ensure the quickest reservation possible.\n\nThat same day, at approximately 2:32 p.m., an additional email clarifying communication went to Andrea Higgins. In this message, Sarena apologized for Andrea not being copied on the previous chain regarding the scheduling of Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and asked Andrea to confirm whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger would be available on May 2nd, 6th, or 8th.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referred to the deposition of a Norton Healthcare corporate representative under 30(b)(6) and the deposition of Nurse Donna Jones, with Donna Jones\u2019s availability stated as May 2nd, May 6th, or May 8th. The correspondence includes the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard contact details, the address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone numbers (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address). The communications also show the chain-of-custody for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition dates and the goal of coordinating a prompt scheduling with Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel and the client\u2019s interests in scheduling around Donna Jones\u2019s other commitments.\n\nIn sum, between December 2024 and March 27, 2025, multiple emails pursued scheduling Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative deposition under 30(b)(6) and Donna Jones\u2019s deposition, with Donna Jones confirming initial availability on May 2, 6, and 8, and with ongoing attempts to secure firm dates and obtain confirmation from Mr. Nafziger and Mr. Effinger (and Andrea Higgins as appropriate) for those proposed May dates.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter titled Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the Whaley Law Firm pursued depositions in the Estate of Betty Prince case, with the litigation team coordinating a deposition scheduling sweep beginning in December 2024 and continuing through March 2025. The record shows a chain of communications among The Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, with the client being the Estate of Betty Prince, and with Norton Healthcare as the defendant.\n\nThe first relevant exchange occurred on December 3, 2024. Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with copies to Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, an Estate of Betty Prince Filevine project email address, and Donna Jones. The subject was Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling. In that email, Sarena stated that their office wished to take the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the corporate representative and dates on which that person would be available to be deposed. She indicated arrangements and inquiry should be discussed if there were questions.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied. He asked whether a proposed CR 30.02(6) deposition notice had been sent and, if so, to resend it. He also requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones.\n\nThe thread continued into 2025. On March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm wrote that Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel had been unable to reach Ms. Donna Jones for potential deposition dates, but that dates were needed for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative. He attached a proposed notice regarding the corporate representative deposition and asked the recipients to review and provide dates for the corporate representative\u2019s deposition at their earliest convenience. He noted that Donna Jones\u2019s deposition dates were not yet confirmed beyond the May 2nd, 6th, or 8th options.\n\nLater on March 18, 2025 at 12:48 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied that they had now received dates from Donna Jones and that she was available on May 2nd, May 6th, or May 8th. She asked which of these dates would work best for the offices and the client.\n\nOn March 25, 2025 at 10:09 AM, Sarena followed up again, reiterating that Donna Jones had availability on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and requesting confirmation whether any of these dates could be scheduled given her client\u2019s calendar.\n\nThen, on March 27, 2025, at about 1:46 PM, Sarena sent another message requesting confirmation or denial of the availability for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition. She stated that the dates provided on March 18, 2025\u2014May 2, May 6, and May 8\u2014had previously been communicated and noted that no response had yet been received. She asked the recipients to check their calendars, explaining that Donna Jones had other commitments and that timely scheduling was desired, with Donna Jones cc\u2019d on the email for fastest possible scheduling.\n\nThat same day, in the afternoon, Andrea Higgins, a legal assistant at Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, responded on behalf of the Norton Healthcare side. In her email, she acknowledged the apology but indicated that Joe Effinger or Ryan Nafziger would be in direct contact regarding the deposition. The response was directed to Sarena Tuttle and included copies to Ryan Nafziger and Joseph Effinger, with additional CCs including Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine Project Email Address, and Donna Jones. Andrea\u2019s signature reproduced her title and the firm\u2019s contact information, along with the firm\u2019s confidentiality disclaimer and contact details. The email reinforced that the deposition would be coordinated by the Norton Healthcare team rather than through a further chain of requests.\n\nThroughout these communications, the matter consistently involved two deposition tracks: a 30(b)(6) deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and the deposition of Nurse Donna Jones, with dates proposed for May 2, 6, or 8, 2025. The record also reflects standard confidentiality notices and routing details typical of law-firm correspondence, including the forwarding and copying to multiple counsel and related parties, and it references the Filevine project address used for the Estate of Betty Prince.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC (PPOA) conducted a series of deposition-scheduling communications in late 2024 and early 2025. The case captioned Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 is being managed with a deposition agenda that includes Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6) and the deposition of Donna Jones, a nurse involved in the matter, on various proposed dates.\n\nThe first documented exchange occurred on December 3, 2024. Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Ryan Nafziger of PPOA. She requested the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the representative and dates on which they would be available to be deposed. Her message included her contact information and was part of the ongoing correspondence involving the Estate of Betty Prince and Norton Healthcare, with the estate\u2019s Filevine project email address listed in the CC field.\n\nTwo days later, on December 5, 2024, Nafziger replied that he was available to discuss dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and asked that the proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition be resent. Andrea Higgins, Legal Assistant to several PPOA attorneys, responded in the same thread, noting that the recipients would hear directly from Joe or Ryan regarding the deposition, and providing her affiliation and contact information. The message also contained the standard confidentiality disclaimer from Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC.\n\nOver the ensuing months, the parties continued with Donna Jones\u2019s deposition scheduling efforts. On March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle wrote that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones and that she was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8. Earlier that same day, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm had written, noting that Norton Healthcare had not yet been reachable for a potential deposition of a corporate representative under 30(b)(6) and attached a proposed notice for that purpose, requesting review and dates for deposition at the other party\u2019s earliest convenience.\n\nBy March 25, 2025, Sarena again followed up, stating that Donna Jones\u2019s availability had been communicated but that no calendar confirmations had been received and asking counsel to confirm whether any of the May dates would work, given that Jones had other commitments she wanted to schedule. She again emphasized the importance of obtaining quick confirmation and cc\u2019d Donna Jones for fast coordination.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Sarena sent a message to Andrea Higgins apologizing for Andrea not being copied on the previous email chain regarding Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and requesting confirmation whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger were available on May 2, May 6, or May 8. Around the same time, at 2:32 PM, Sarena sent a chain that included Ryan Nafziger, Joseph Effinger, Andrea Higgins, Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, the Betty Prince Filevine contact, and Donna Jones, asking for quick coordination on the deposition date. In a reply at 2:55 PM, Ryan Nafziger indicated that he was available on May 6. A final scheduling note from Sarena at 3:30 PM on March 27 suggested a 10:00 AM start at Nafziger\u2019s office as a potential time, seeking confirmation of that arrangement.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications reference the deposition of Donna Jones as a Nurse and the corporate representative deposition under 30(b)(6), with the participants repeatedly seeking available dates (May 2, 6, or 8 for Donna Jones) and confirming attendance and preferred times. The subject line accompanying these emails consistently revolved around Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare and the Deposition Scheduling, with the parties\u2019 contact points and the Filevine project address included in the distribution lists. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville office is listed in the signatures, along with the PPOA firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address and related contact details.",

      "natural_language": "In the case captioned Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC engaged in a sequence of deposition-scheduling emails beginning in December 2024 and continuing through March 2025. The initial request, dated December 3, 2024, came from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, addressed to Ryan Nafziger and others. In that message, sent on The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s behalf, she stated that the office sought to take the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under CR 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the designated representative as well as the dates on which that person would be available to be deposed. The email carried the subject Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling, and Sarena cc\u2019d a number of recipients, including Andrea Higgins, and listed the firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nRyan Nafziger replied on December 5, 2024. He asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and, in addition, requested dates for the deposition of Donna Jones. His reply carried a confidential/privilege notice typical of firm correspondence, and he closed with his signature and contact details.\n\nAs the scheduling process continued into 2025, The Whaley Law Firm pressed for progress. On March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm stated that they had not yet reached Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative regarding potential deposition dates and indicated a desire to receive dates for the corporate representative\u2019s deposition; he attached a proposed notice for that purpose and asked for dates at the recipient\u2019s earliest convenience.\n\nLater on March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied that Donna Jones had provided availability for a deposition on May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, and she asked which of those dates would work best for the other side\u2019s office and client. In the same thread, she noted that Donna Jones had provided those dates back on March 18, 2025, and she requested confirmation of which dates would be workable.\n\nEarlier in the same month, on March 18, 2025 at 10:44 a.m., Bryce Koon had written that Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative deposition dates were still needed because they had been unable to reach Ms. Jones regarding potential deposition dates. He referred to the attached proposed notice and asked the recipients to review it and provide dates for the corporate representative\u2019s deposition at their earliest convenience.\n\nThe chain also contains a separate exchange from December 5, 2024, and prior communication on December 3, 2024, that framed the ongoing need to schedule both the corporate representative deposition under 30(b)(6) and the deposition of Donna Jones. The December 3, 2024 email asked for the name of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and the dates available for deposition. The December 5, 2024 reply asked whether a proposed CR 30.02(6) notice had been sent and reiterated the request for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition dates.\n\nAs the discussions progressed, on March 25, 2025, Sarena again reached out to counsel, noting that Donna Jones had previously provided availability of May 2, May 6, or May 8, and that they had not yet received responses. She asked counsel to confirm whether any of those dates would work for their office and to schedule accordingly, noting that Donna Jones had other commitments she wished to accommodate.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Sarena sent another message reiterating the request for confirmation or denial of availability for Mrs. Donna Jones\u2019s deposition on May 2, May 6, or May 8, referencing the prior communications from March 18, 25, and 27, 2025, and indicating that Donna Jones had been cc\u2019d into the conversation for the quickest reservation possible.\n\nLater on March 27, 2025, at 2:32 p.m., Sarena apologized for not copying Andrea Higgins on the prior thread and asked for confirmation whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger would be available on May 2, May 6, or May 8.\n\nThat same day, March 27, 2025, at 6:55 p.m. UTC, Ryan Nafziger responded to Sarena with a direct note: \u201cSarena, I am available May 6.\u201d Andrea Higgins subsequently sent a reply indicating that the deposition would be coordinated with the parties and that \u201cyou will hear from Joe or Ryan directly regarding the deposition.\u201d\n\nThe correspondence reflects the following participants and their roles: Ryan D. Nafziger (attorney for the Estate/defense team member, associated with PPOA), Andrea L. Higgins (Legal Assistant to Joseph M. Effinger, Esq.; Matthew A. Piekarski, Esq.; Ryan D. Nafziger, Esq.; and Michael J. Austin, Esq., of the Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC firm), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm), Bryce Koon (Esq., The Whaley Law Firm), Aaron Whaley (Esq., The Whaley Law Firm), Donna Jones (listed as a client contact for scheduling), and the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine project email address (as a cc\u2019d recipient). The emails reveal a continuing process to schedule two kinds of depositions: (1) Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under CR 30(b)(6), and (2) Donna Jones, a nurse whose deposition had been proposed for May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025. The communications also show that the parties used different law firms and that standard confidentiality disclaimers and notices accompanied the email exchanges.\n\nIn short, between December 3, 2024 and March 27, 2025, the parties worked to set two depositions in the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare case: a 30(b)(6) deposition for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative, and a deposition of Nurse Donna Jones, with May 2, May 6, and May 8, 2025 repeatedly proposed as potential dates. By late March 2025, Ryan Nafziger indicated he was available on May 6, and Andrea Higgins signaled that the deposition would be coordinated with the appropriate counsel.",

      "natural_language": "The Estate of Betty Prince is pursuing a deposition schedule in the case Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, with the estate\u2019s counsel seeking two depositions: Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6) and Nurse Donna Jones, the latter being associated with the estate\u2019s perimeters of discovery. The Whaley Law Firm represents the estate in these matters, and the correspondence thread runs from December 2024 through March 2025, involving attorneys and paralegals from The Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, as well as the nurse Donna Jones and Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, acting as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, sent an inquiries email to Ryan Nafziger of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, among others. The message stated that the Whaley firm wished to take the deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s Corporate Representative under 30(b)(6) and asked for the name of the representative and dates on which that person would be available to be deposed. The email included the firm\u2019s contact details and noted that the message was intended for the named recipients with the standard confidentiality notice in the signature block.\n\nIn response on December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger asked whether a proposed notice for the CR 30.02(6) deposition had been sent and requested dates for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition as well. The exchange shows that Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel was awaiting a proposed CR 30.02(6) deposition notice and simultaneously being asked for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition dates.\n\nFollowing this thread, on March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a message to counsel stating that, although Norton Healthcare had been unable to reach Donna Jones for potential deposition dates, they wished to obtain dates for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and attached a proposed notice regarding that deposition; he asked the recipients to review and provide dates for the corporate-representative deposition at their earliest convenience.\n\nLater that same day, March 18, 2025 at 12:48 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied to Bryce, informing him that they had now received dates from Donna Jones. She stated that Jones was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and she asked which of those dates would work best for the office and the client.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Sarena followed up again, noting that Donna Jones had provided availability for May 2, 6, or 8 and asking for confirmation if any of those dates would work for the opposing side\u2019s office and scheduling needs.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, at approximately 1:46 p.m., Sarena sent another message reiterating that they were seeking confirmation or denial of the availability for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and indicating that the May 2, 6, or 8 dates had been provided back on March 18, 2025, and that no response had yet been received. She requested a timely response so that Jones\u2019s other commitments could be scheduled accordingly.\n\nShortly after, at 3:30 p.m. on March 27, 2025, Sarena\u2019s initial reply to the most recent thread included a direct inquiry to Andrea Higgins, noting that Andrea had not been copied on the earlier chain discussing Donna Jones\u2019s deposition scheduling, and asking Andrea to confirm whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger would be available on May 2, May 6, or May 8.\n\nIn a follow-up that same day, Ryan Nafziger replied at 2:55 p.m. that he was available on May 6. This reply came in the context of the ongoing scheduling coordination for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition.\n\nEarlier on March 27, 2025, at approximately 1:34 p.m., Andrea Higgins replied to the thread with wording indicating she would handle the matter through Joe or Ryan directly regarding the deposition, and she thanked the sender for the apology, noting that she would hear from Joe or Ryan directly about the deposition scheduling. Andrea\u2019s signature block also identified her role as Legal Assistant to Joseph M. Effinger, Esq., Matthew A. Piekarski, Esq., Ryan D. Nafziger, Esq., and Michael J. Austin, Esq., with contact details and a standard confidentiality disclaimer. The thread also contains the email chain header and the institutional boilerplate from Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC.\n\nAdditionally, embedded in the correspondence are the various recipients and CCs, including the estate\u2019s Filevine project email address for the Betty Prince matter, and Donna Jones\u2019s contact in the matter.\n\nFinally, within the wider thread there is a note from December 2024 requesting a CR 30.02(6) deposition notice for Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and asking for the name of the corporate representative and available dates, consistent with the estate\u2019s objective to obtain both depositions\u2014Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and Norton Healthcare\u2019s 30(b)(6) deposition\u2014in a coordinated schedule. The exchange reflects ongoing negotiations about dates, times, and the appropriate party contacts, with the most concrete points of agreement appearing in March 2025 around Donna Jones\u2019s availability for deposition on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and a partial confirmation of availability for May 6 from Mr. Nafziger. The discussions also show a proposed 10:00 a.m. start for Donna Jones\u2019s deposition and the corresponding responses about availability.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020\nClient: Estate of Betty Prince\n\nIn the matter of Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, the parties engaged in a series of deposition scheduling communications. The Whaley Law Firm correspondence centers on scheduling depositions for a corporate representative under Rule 30(b)(6) and for a deposition of Ms. Donna Jones, a nurse whose availability was being coordinated with counsel for Norton Healthcare, as well as confirmation of dates from Norton Healthcare\u2019s counsel.\n\nThe chain began with a December 3, 2024 email from Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, addressed to Ryan Nafziger of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, with a carbon copy list including Andrea Higgins; Joseph Effinger; Bryce Koon; Aaron Whaley; a Filevine project email address for Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020; and Donna Jones. The subject was Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare - Deposition Scheduling. In the message, Sarena requested the name of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative for a 30(b)(6) deposition and the dates that representative would be available for deposition. She provided contact details for her firm: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D (502) 357-9971, O (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and noted the recipient\u2019s new email address.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Ryan Nafziger replied (subject line carried in the thread), asking whether a proposed CR 30.02(6) notice had been sent and requesting dates for the deposition of Donna Jones.\n\nJumping forward to March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email at 10:44 a.m. to counsel, explaining that Norton Healthcare had been unable to reach Ms. Jones for potential deposition dates and that they would like dates for Norton\u2019s corporate representative as well. He attached a proposed notice for the 30(b)(6) deposition and asked counsel to review and provide deposition dates at their earliest convenience.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:48 p.m., Sarena responded: they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones, who was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8; she asked which of these dates would work best for counsel\u2019s office and client.\n\nSubsequently, on March 25, 2025 at 10:09 a.m., Sarena sent another message reiterating the request for availability for Donna Jones, noting that she was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and asking counsel to confirm whether any of these dates would work for their office and to schedule accordingly.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, at 1:34 p.m., Andrea Higgins, Legal Assistant to several Norton Healthcare defense attorneys (including Joseph M. Effinger, Esq.; Matthew A. Piekarski, Esq.; Ryan D. Nafziger, Esq.; and Michael J. Austin, Esq.), replied thanking for the apology and indicated that she would have Joe or Ryan contact the deposition scheduling directly regarding the deposition.\n\nAt 2:32 p.m. on March 27, 2025, Sarena replied to Andrea, apologizing for not being copied on the previous email chain regarding Donna Jones\u2019 deposition scheduling and asking Andrea to confirm whether Mr. Nafziger and/or Mr. Effinger would be available on May 2, May 6, or May 8.\n\nLater that same afternoon, at 2:55 p.m., Ryan Nafziger wrote: \u201cSarena, I am available May 6.\u201d He noted this in the thread continuing the deposition scheduling discussion.\n\nThe thread also shows the broader context of the correspondence, including earlier communications from December 2024. On December 3, 2024, Sarena had initiated the request for a 30(b)(6) deposition of Norton Healthcare\u2019s corporate representative and the dates available, and Ryan had replied on December 5, 2024, asking about the proposed CR 30.02(6) notice and requesting Donna Jones deposition dates. The communications included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard firm signatures and confidentiality notices, as well as the contact details for the Norton Healthcare defense team and related counsel, with the emails circulated among several recipients and CC\u2019d individuals, including the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine Project Email Address and Donna Jones.\n\nIn sum, the parties engaged in a back-and-forth to schedule two depositions: (1) a corporate representative under 30(b)(6) for Norton Healthcare, and (2) Ms. Donna Jones, a nurse. The proposed dates for Ms. Jones were May 2, May 6, or May 8, 2025, with Norton HealthCare\u2019s counsel indicating availability for May 6; counsel continued to coordinate with Ms. Jones\u2019 availability and the counsel for Norton Healthcare, with communications spanning December 2024 through March 27, 2025.",

Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Donna Jones of DSJ & Associates, with Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley copied. The message confirmed the May 6, 2025 deposition date, scheduled to begin at 10:00 AM, at the office of Philip, Parker & Orberson located at 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. Sarena provided her contact information and noted a new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with direct dial (502) 357-9971 and office extension 104 at (502) 583-4022. She invited Donna to contact them directly with any questions.\n\nEarlier in the thread, later the same day, Sarena replied to Donna stating that she had already sent a follow-up to the defense and would send another one immediately. She said she would update Donna as soon as she heard back, emphasized not to miss any commitments on their behalf, and warned that if Donna needed to use the specified dates and consider June, they would have to accommodate that. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle with the same firm and contact details, reiterating the new email address.\n\nIn the preceding exchange from March 26, 2025, at 3:56 PM, Donna Jones had written back, asking for urgent confirmation of which of the dates she provided\u2014May 2, May 6, and May 8\u2014would work for the Prince deposition. She explained she was preparing her calendar for April and May and had multiple other commitments. Donna requested timely information from the defense; if such information was not forthcoming, she indicated she would not be able to commit to the deposition until sometime in June. Her message included her personal and professional contact details: Donna Jones, RN, DSJ & Associates, 412 Hidden Lakes Lane, Brunswick, GA 31525; donna@dsjandassociates.com; www.dsjandassociates.com; 404-290-2733 (cell). The email also contained the standard confidentiality and privilege notice common to transmissions of this type, stating that the message is intended only for the addressees and should be destroyed if the reader is not an intended recipient.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 12:46 PM, Sarena replied to Donna with a note that she would forward the dates to Defense Counsel to see which date works best for all parties, promising to reach out with a confirmation as soon as more information was available. The email was copied to Bryce Koon and carried the Whaley Law Firm signature and contact details, including the new email address.\n\nDonna had previously responded on March 17, 2025, at 7:32 AM, listing May 2, May 6, and May 8 as available dates and requesting prompt notification so she could place them on the calendar. She also asked that, if there were other records beyond Betty Prince\u2019s Norton Health records\u2014including Norton\u2019s policies and procedures or any depositions taken\u2014these be forwarded to her for review. Donna again provided her contact information (Donna Jones, RN) and the DSJ & Associates contact details, along with the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, at 2:49 PM, Sarena sent a message to Donna reiterating the request for the best dates and times for Donna\u2019s deposition and inviting Donna to contact the Whaley Law Firm to discuss details further. This message also included Sarena\u2019s standard signature and new email address.\n\nThe chronology traces back to an earlier email on February 24, 2025, when Sarena wrote to Mrs. Jones. She reminded that, in October/November 2021, Donna had reviewed medical records for Betty Prince after she fell during a doctor visit at Norton Healthcare, an event that ultimately led to Betty Prince\u2019s passing. Sarena noted that a copy of Donna\u2019s statement had been attached for reference. With trial approaching, the deposition needed to be taken prior to the scheduling order being issued, and Sarena requested dates in April when Donna would be available to provide the deposition.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties\u2019 communications repeatedly reference the Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, with the case caption and client identity consistently noted as the Estate of Betty Prince. The communications demonstrate ongoing scheduling efforts, coordination with defense counsel, and the multiple date considerations for May (and potential June), all while maintaining the contact details and confidentiality notices customary to these professional disclosures.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Betty-Prince-Premise-7-14-2020. Client: Estate of Betty Prince. The matter concerns Estate of Betty Prince v Norton Healthcare, and the deposition scheduling for Nurse Donna Jones as part of the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 litigation, with the file maintained under the Filevine project account BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and shared with multiple counsel.\n\nIn the email chain dated March through May 2025, counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett (PPOA) coordinated depositions for this case. On March 18, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, emailed counsel to note that he had not been able to reach Ms. Donna Jones for potential deposition dates and to attach a proposed notice regarding the deposition of a corporate representative, asking recipients to review and provide dates as soon as possible. His message stated that the electronic communication was from The Whaley Law Firm and included his contact information and a standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied that they had now received dates from Mrs. Donna Jones. Jones was available on May 2, May 6, or May 8, and Sarena asked which of those dates would work best for the opposing office and client.\n\nOver the following weeks, multiple messages circulated among the parties. On March 18, 2025, Sarena reiterated that Donna Jones had provided availability for May 2, 6, or 8, and she asked counsel to confirm which dates would work. Bryce had previously indicated that he would send dates for a corporate representative deposition and asked for dates promptly. On March 25, 2025, Sarena followed up again, noting that she had not yet received confirmations and reminding counsel that Donna Jones had provided May 2, 6, and 8 as available dates and that she would like to reserve one of those dates for Jones given her other commitments.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Sarena suggested a 10:00 a.m. start at the opposing office if that was acceptable for the deposition of Donna Jones. Ryan D. Nafziger, Esq., responded that he was available on May 6. Earlier in the day, Andrea Higgins, the legal assistant for PPOA, apologized for an earlier miscommunication and indicated that Mr. Nafziger or Mr. Effinger would handle direct communications regarding the deposition. In a separate exchange on March 27, 2025, Sarena confirmed the proposed 10:00 a.m. start, and Ryan acknowledged his availability for May 6. A prior note from Ryan had confirmed that May 6 would work for him, and Sarena acknowledged that confirmation.\n\nThroughout the chain, the participants included in the correspondence included: Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) as sender on the initial outreach; Ryan Nafziger (rnafziger@ppoalaw.com); Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com); Andrea Higgins (ahiggins@ppoalaw.com); Joseph Effinger (jeffinger@ppoalaw.com); Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com); the Estate of Betty Prince Premise 7/14/2020 Filevine Project Email Address BettyPrinceSFZ954585@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com; and Donna Jones (Donna@dsjandassociates.com). The subject of the discussions was the deposition scheduling for Nurse Donna Jones, and the emails referenced coordinated dates, preferred start times, and the availability of the various parties for those depositions.\n\nMost recently, on May 5, 2025, the matter took a turn when Ryan Nafziger wrote that he would have to cancel Nurse Donna Jones\u2019s deposition the following day due to an unavoidable conflict. He proposed that Bryce Koon be available later in the week to discuss the case. In response, Bryce Koon stated that he would give Ryan a call on Thursday or Friday to discuss the matter further.\n\nThe May 5, 2025 email from Bryce Koon, like the previous messages, contained the standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer common to the firm\u2019s electronic communications, and reiterated the parties involved and the contact details for The Whaley Law Firm, including the firm\u2019s Louisville address and phone numbers. The email chain reflects ongoing efforts to schedule the depositions of Nurse Donna Jones and, potentially, a corporate representative, with tentative dates indicated (May 2, May 6, or May 8 for Jones, and May 6 as a possible date for the deposition start depending on the party\u2019s availability), and with ongoing coordination among counsel to finalize a date and time.",
