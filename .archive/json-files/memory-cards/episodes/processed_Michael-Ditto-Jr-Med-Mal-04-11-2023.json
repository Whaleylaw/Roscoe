The email is from Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Cameal Stafford, with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon cc\u2019d, dated Friday, December 13, 2024 at 13:27:10 Eastern Time. The purpose of the message is to follow up on the Minor Intake for Michael Jr. and to request clarifications and additional information necessary for advancing the minor\u2019s claim.\n\nIn the body of the email, Sarena thanks Cameal for completing the Minor Intake for Michael Jr. and asks several clarifying questions. She asks for details about Cameal\u2019s relationship with Michael Ditto Sr., specifically whether they are married, whether custody has been decided by a Family Court if not married, and whether Michael Sr. is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life, noting that custody is a relevant issue for minor claims. She references information in the intake indicating that Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in the ICU at Norton Hospital, asking whether this was the Downtown location. She then notes that on 04/11/2023 Michael was to have a routine circumcision, but there was an issue found at his first primary care check-up, and asks who the Primary Care Physician (PCP) is.\n\nThe email also asks for confirmation regarding a revision surgery, questioning whether it occurred in December 2023 and who completed that revision surgery. Sarena mentions a complaint that had been made to Norton Hospital and asks whether there are records of those complaints for the file. She inquires whether Michael has received any other treatments, such as additional surgeries, therapy, or any follow-up visits, and asks for a complete list of all doctors Michael has seen.\n\nRegarding next steps, Sarena states that once the requested information is received, the firm will initiate medical record requests to obtain copies of all of Michael\u2019s medical records and will place Norton Healthcare on Notice of Michael\u2019s claim. She cautions that this part of the process can take 30\u201345 days to obtain the records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare.

      "natural_language": "This file documents a medical malpractice matter for Michael Ditto Jr., labeled as Case Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023, with the client listed as Michael Ditto. The communication trail begins with an email from KillA StyleS, sent from reddcameal@gmail.com on December 13, 2024, stated as part of the case file notes. In that email, KillA StyleS indicates an attempt to access Michael Ditto\u2019s Norton MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of the treating doctors for the record. The email notes the primary care location as Stonestreet, ZIP code 40272.\n\nOn the same day, December 13, 2024, at 1:59 PM (approximate), Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded. She thanked KillA StyleS for the information, said she would update the file, and would issue record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urology as soon as possible. She also asked whether Michael\u2019s primary care physician is affiliated with Norton Dutchman, and provided her contact information and new email address.\n\nIn a reply later that day, KillA StyleS confirmed that she and Michael Ditto Sr. are married and that Michael Jr. lives at home with them. She stated that Michael was born at Norton Dutchman Lane location. She reported that she immediately complained about the initial circumcision date of 4/11/23, noting that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record that there were any problems or complaints in her notes regarding Michael Jr.\u2019s case files. She also said she filed a complaint with Norton Dutchman Hospital at the phone number 502-559-4490. Norton Dutchman Hospital offered to pay for Michael Jr.\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery scheduled for 12/12/23. She stated that she complained to Michael\u2019s primary care provider at the six-week check-up that he was in pain and that the circumcision was not going well, and she was referred to his urologist at the Norton Dutchman location, who she said has extensive notes on everything.\n\nLater on December 13, 2024, at 1:27 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent another email to Cameal (the sender\u2019s name in KillA StyleS\u2019s messages) acknowledging the completion of the Minor Intake for Michael Jr. She requested clarification of Cameal\u2019s relationship with Michael Ditto Sr., asking whether they are married and, if not, whether custody has been decided by a Family Court and whether Michael Sr. is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life, noting that custody is a relevant issue for minor claims. She stated she saw in the intake that Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in ICU at Norton Hospital, asking whether this was the Downtown location. She asked for confirmation that on 04/11/2023 Michael was to undergo a routine circumcision but that an issue was found at the first primary care check-up, and she asked who the Primary Care Physician was. She inquired whether Michael\u2019s revision surgery occurred in December 2023 and who completed that revision. She asked if there were any records of the complaints to Norton Hospital and requested copies of those records. She asked whether Michael had any other treatments, such as additional surgeries, therapy, or follow-up visits, and requested a complete list of all doctors Michael has seen. She stated that once the requested information is received, medical record requests would be issued to obtain copies of all of Michael\u2019s medical records and to place Norton Healthcare on notice of Michael\u2019s claim. She noted that the process can take 30\u201345 days to obtain the records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare, asked for patience, and invited direct contact with any questions. The email concluded with Sarena\u2019s signature, including her title and contact details at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn summary, the communications center around securing and consolidating Michael Ditto Jr.\u2019s medical records related to a potential medical malpractice claim, confirming family relationships and custody considerations for a minor claimant, clarifying the treatment timeline (including the 04/11/2023 circumcision and the December 2023 revision), and coordinating record requests to Norton Healthcare facilities (Norton Dutchman Hospital and Norton Urology) with attention to dates, locations, and involved providers.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023\nClient: Michael Ditto\n\nIn the matter of Michael Ditto Jr., a medical malpractice case dated 04-11-2023, the following exchange occurred on December 13, 2024 between The Whaley Law Firm and the client\u2019s associates. Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, began by noting that she would send a records request to the appropriate parties and asked for any information the client could provide. She stated that there was enough information to get started and that she would request records from all departments and physicians involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s care.\n\nLater that same day, KillA StyleS indicated that their primary care is at Stonestreet (zip code 40272) and that they were attempting to access Michael Norton\u2019s MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of the doctors for the file.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied that she appreciated the information, would update the client file, and would issue record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and a Norton urologist as soon as possible. She also asked whether Michael Jr.\u2019s primary care physician is with Norton Dutchman.\n\nIn response, KillA StyleS provided additional context. She stated that she and Michael Sr. are married and live together. Michael Jr. was born at Norton Dutchman Lane location. She reported that she immediately complained about the initial circumcision date of 04-11-2023, noting that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record any problems or complaints in her notes for Michael Jr.\u2019s files. She also said she filed a complaint with Norton Dutchman Hospital at the phone number 502-559-4490, and that Norton Dutchman Hospital offered to pay for Michael\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery on 12-12-2023. She reported that at Michael Jr.\u2019s six-week primary care check-up, she told the provider that he was in pain and that the circumcision was not healing properly; the primary care provider agreed and referred her to Michael Jr.\u2019s urologist at the Norton Dutchman location, who she said has extensive notes on everything.\n\nFollowing this, Sarena Tuttle sent a detailed inquiry seeking clarification for the Minor Intake. She asked Cameal to confirm the relationship with Michael Ditto Sr., asking whether Cameal is married, whether custody has been decided by a Family Court if they are not married, and whether Michael Sr. is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life, noting that custody is a relevant issue for minor claims. She observed that Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in the ICU at Norton Hospital, asking whether that was at the Downtown location. She confirmed that on 04/11/2023 Michael Jr. was to undergo a routine circumcision but that an issue had been found at the first primary care check-up and asked who the Primary Care Physician was. She asked whether the revision surgery appeared to have occurred in December 2023 and who completed it. She requested records of any complaints to Norton Hospital and asked for a complete list of any and all other treatments, surgeries, therapy, or follow-up visits and all doctors Michael Jr. has seen. She reiterated that once the requested information is received, medical record requests would be issued to obtain copies of all Michael\u2019s medical records and to place Norton Healthcare on notice of Michael\u2019s claim. She cautioned that the process to obtain records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare could take 30-45 days and encouraged patience, while inviting direct questions. She closed by expressing the firm\u2019s commitment to assisting Michael and working with him and Michael Sr. as the matter progresses.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023. Client: Michael Ditto.\n\nIn the matter titled \u201cRe: Michael Ditto Jr - Medical Malpractice 04/11/2023,\u201d a communication was sent on December 13, 2024 from KillA StyleS (reddcameal@gmail.com) to Sarena M. Tuttle at Whaley Law Firm (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com). The message references Elisha McAmont, a urologist, located at 3999 Dutchman Ln, Plaza 1, Suite 6F, Louisville, KY 40207, and notes that there is a substantial amount of documentation on Michael Jr.\n\nThe thread shows that KillA StyleS indicated on December 13, 2024 at 2:33 PM that there had been substantial documentation. In response, on December 13, 2024 at 2:09 PM Sarena Tuttle wrote that she would also obtain a request for records and that she would send information as soon as possible. She stated that there is enough information to get started and that she would request records for all departments and physicians.\n\nSarena Tuttle\u2019s message provided her contact details and emphasized that they would request records from Norton Hospital Dutchman, Norton Hospital, and Norton Urologist, and asked for any information to be sent. The note appears to be part of a workflow to gather medical records and begin processing the claim.\n\nEarlier messages show that on December 13, 2024 at 2:05 PM KillA StyleS mentioned the primary care location as Stonestreet 40272 and that they were trying to access Michael Norton MyChart to obtain the exact names and dates of doctors for the file.\n\nAt 1:59 PM on December 13, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded: she would update the file and issue record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urologist as soon as possible, and she asked whether Michael\u2019s Primary Care Physician was also with Norton Dutchman.\n\nAt 1:50 PM, KillA StyleS clarified that he and Michael Sr. are married, that Michael Jr. lives at their home, and that Michael was born at Norton Dutchman Ln location. He stated that he immediately complained about the initial circumcision date of 4/11/23 because Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record any problems or complaints in her notes regarding Michael Jr. He reported filing a complaint with Norton\u2019s Dutchman Hospital at the number 502-559-4490, and that Norton Dutchman Hospital offered to pay for Michael\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery on 12/12/23. He also noted that at Michael\u2019s six-week check-up with his primary care provider, Michael Jr. was in pain and the circumcision was not progressing well; he was referred to the urologist at the Norton Dutchman location, who, according to him, has extensive notes on everything.\n\nAt 1:27 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent a detailed inquiry requesting clarifications regarding Michael Ditto Sr.\u2019s relationship to Michael Jr. (whether they are married, and if not, whether custody has been decided in Family Court and whether Michael Sr. is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life). She explained that custody is a relevant issue for minor claims. She confirmed that the intake indicated Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in the ICU at Norton Hospital, and she asked whether this was the Downtown location. She asked for confirmation that on 04/11/2023 Michael was scheduled for a routine circumcision but an issue was found at the first primary care check-up, and she inquired about the Primary Care Physician. She asked whether there was a revision surgery in December 2023 and who completed that revision. She requested any records of complaints filed with Norton Hospital and asked for a complete list of all treatments, additional surgeries, therapy, or follow-up visits, including every doctor Michael has seen. She stated that once the information is received, they would issue medical record requests to obtain copies of all of Michael\u2019s medical records and place Norton Healthcare on notice of the claim; she noted that this process can take 30\u201345 days and asked for patience, inviting direct questions. She concluded with her Whaley Law Firm contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nOverall, the exchange centers on gathering complete medical and custodial information related to Michael Ditto Jr.\u2019s birth in 2023, the circumcision performed on 04/11/2023 and subsequent treatment including a proposed revision surgery in December 2023, complaints filed with Norton Hospital (including a specific complaint to Norton Dutchman Hospital and a request regarding payment for re-circumcision/repair), and the team\u2019s efforts to obtain comprehensive records from Norton Health systems, with the aim of advancing a medical malpractice claim. Further detail and confirmation from the involved parties were requested to assemble a full medical history and determine custodial involvement for purposes of the minor claim.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023. Client: Michael Ditto. The matter concerns Michael Ditto Jr. and a medical malpractice claim associated with events around 04-11-2023.\n\nOn Friday, December 13, 2024, KillA StyleS, using the email reddcameal@gmail.com, sent a message to Sarena M. Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm regarding the Michael Ditto Jr. matter (re: Michael Ditto Jr - Medical Malpractice 04/11/2023). In that initial outreach, KillA StyleS stated that Sarena should receive information as soon as possible, noting that there is enough information to get started and that records would be requested from all departments and physicians.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied that she would get a record request over to Norton Hospital as well, and she asked KillA to send the information whenever available. She noted that they have enough information to begin and would request any and all records from any and all departments and physicians. She also provided her contact details and new email address for future communications, including her role as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line and office line information.\n\nEarlier in the thread, KillA StyleS indicated that the primary care location was Stonestreet, ZIP 40272, and that they were attempting to access Michael Norton\u2019s MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of doctors involved.\n\nSarena followed up, thanking KillA StyleS for the information, and stated that she would update the file and send record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urologist as soon as possible. She asked whether Michael\u2019s Primary Care Physician is also with Norton Dutchman.\n\nIn response, KillA StyleS clarified several details: Michael Ditto Sr. and KillA StyleS are married, and Michael Jr. lives in their home with them. Michael Jr. was born at Norton Dutchman location. The initial circumcision occurred on 04/11/23, and Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record any problems or complaints in Michael Jr.\u2019s notes. The speaker claimed to have filed a complaint with Norton\u2019s Dutchman hospital at the phone number 502-559-4490, and that Norton Hospital offered to pay for Michael\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery on 12/12/23. They also stated that at Michael\u2019s six-week check-up, he was in pain and the circumcision was not healing properly, and they were referred to a urologist at the Norton Dutchman location, who has extensive notes on the matter.\n\nSarena then sent a more detailed inquiry on 1:27 PM, requesting crucial information to proceed. She asked Cameal to clarify her relationship with Michael Ditto Sr, specifically whether they are married and whether custody has been decided by a Family Court, and whether Michael Sr is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life, noting that custody is a relevant issue for minor claims. She observed that the intake lists Michael\u2019s birth date as 04/07/2023 and that he was in ICU at Norton Hospital, querying whether this was the Downtown location. She confirmed that on 04/11/2023 Michael was to have a routine circumcision but there was an issue found at his first primary care check-up, and she asked for the identity of the Primary Care Physician. She inquired whether Michael was referred for a revision surgery, seemingly in December 2023, and who completed that revision surgery. She asked whether there are records of the complaints made to Norton Hospital for the file and whether Michael has received any other treatments, such as additional surgeries, therapy, or follow-up visits, requesting a complete list of all doctors Michael has seen.\n\nSarena explained that once the requested information is received, they would issue medical record requests to obtain copies of all of Michael\u2019s medical records and place Norton Healthcare on Notice of Michael\u2019s claim. She warned that the process to obtain records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare could take 30\u201345 days and urged patience, inviting direct contact with any questions as the team progresses.

      "natural_language": "The case is titled Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023, with client Michael Ditto. On December 13, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to KillA StyleS regarding the Michael Ditto Jr. medical malpractice matter. In her message, she noted that she hoped the records would contain everything needed and asked if United Insurance and a reference number referred to Michael\u2019s health insurance, requesting a copy of any health insurance coverage he has. She also reported that she had sent a record request to Norton and would keep KillA StyleS posted as things progressed. The email concluded with Sarena\u2019s signature and her note to please use her new email address.\n\nEarlier that day, KillA StyleS referenced Elisha McAmont, a urologist, located at 3999 Dutchman Lane, Place 1, Suite 6F, Louisville, KY 40207, stating that there was a lot of documentation on Michael Jr. The thread shows additional replies from KillA StyleS at 2:33 p.m. and 2:36 p.m., though the 2:33 p.m. message content is not shown in the excerpt.\n\nAt 2:09 p.m., Sarena replied that she would get a request over to Norton as well and encouraged sending information as soon as possible. She noted that there was enough information to start and that they would request records from all departments and physicians.\n\nEarlier, at 2:05 p.m., KillA StyleS had written about a Primary Care physician at Stonestreet (ZIP 40272) and indicated an attempt to access Michael Norton MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of the doctors involved.\n\nIn a follow-up at 1:59 p.m., Sarena thanked KillA StyleS for the information and said she would update the file and send record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urologist as soon as possible. She asked whether Michael\u2019s Primary Care Physician was also with Norton Dutchman.\n\nAt 1:50 p.m., KillA StyleS confirmed that she and Michael Sr. were married, and that Michael Jr. lives at home with them. She stated that Michael was born at Norton Dutchman Lane and described an issue with the initial circumcision dated 04/11/2023, noting that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not document any problems or complaints in Michael Jr.\u2019s notes. She said she filed a complaint with Norton\u2019s Dutchman Hospital via the number 502-559-4490. Norton was reportedly offering to pay for Michael\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery on 12/12/23. She also stated that she complained at Michael\u2019s six-week primary care checkup that he was in pain and that the circumcision was not healing well, and that he was referred to his urologist at the Norton Dutchman location, who has extensive notes on everything.\n\nEarlier still, at 1:27 p.m., Sarena sent a detailed inquiry to Cameal (Cameal\u2019s role was described as completing the Minor Intake for Michael Jr.). She asked Cameal to clarify the relationship with Michael Ditto Sr., whether they were married, whether custody had been decided by a Family Court, and whether Michael Sr. was actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life, noting that custody can be relevant for minor claims. She also asked for confirmation that Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in ICU at Norton Hospital, asking whether this was the Downtown location. She sought confirmation that on 04/11/2023 Michael was scheduled for a routine circumcision but an issue was found at his first primary care checkup, and she asked who the Primary Care Physician was. She inquired whether Michael was referred for a revision surgery around December 2023, who completed that revision, and whether there were any records of the complaints at Norton Hospital. She requested a complete list of every doctor Michael had seen and asked for all records to be obtained so Norton Healthcare could be placed on notice of Michael\u2019s claim. She warned that the records request process could take 30\u201345 days and invited Cameal to contact the firm with any questions, expressing their readiness to assist Michael and work with Michael Sr. as the matter progressed. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, with her Whaley Law Firm contact details and a note reiterating the new email address.\n\nTogether, the exchanges establish that the team is coordinating to gather comprehensive records from Norton Hospital (including the Dutchman location), Norton Urology, and any primary care sources, to verify details of Michael Ditto Jr.\u2019s birth in 2023, the circumscription episode on 04/11/2023, subsequent complaints and revision surgery anticipated around December 2023, and any additional treatments or follow-up care. They are also seeking confirmation of health insurance coverage and the primary care physician\u2019s affiliation, with an emphasis on obtaining a complete list of all doctors seen and their records, while Norton Healthcare is to be placed on notice of the claim. The process, as described, anticipates a 30\u201345 day window to obtain records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare.",

      "natural_language": "On December 13, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm began consolidating records for the Michael Ditto Jr. medical malpractice case, noted as case Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023, with client Michael Ditto. The discussion centers on events around his birth and early circumcision in 2023. Michael Ditto Jr. was born on 04/07/2023 and was in the ICU at Norton Hospital; the hospital location is referenced as Norton (Downtown location is questioned in intake notes). The initial circumcision was scheduled for 04/11/2023, but the family alleges there were problems that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record in her notes. The family reported filing a complaint about this to Norton Hospital, using the phone number 502-559-4490 and noting a Google Maps reference to \u201c712 Michael re-circumcision and repair Surgery 12/12/23.\u201d The family also complained to Michael\u2019s primary care at his six-week check-up, stating that he was in pain and that the circumcision was not resolving properly, after which they were referred to a Norton Dutchman location urologist who has extensive notes on the case.\n\nIn the email thread, Sarena M. Tuttle asked KillA StyleS to confirm whether United Insurance was Michael\u2019s health insurance and to provide a copy of any health insurance coverage. She stated that a record request had been sent to Norton and that Norton Healthcare would be placed on Notice once records were obtained, noting that the process to secure records from Norton Healthcare could take 30\u201345 days. She also indicated that she had sent record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and to Norton Urologist and that they would request records from all departments and physicians as needed.\n\nThe communications show an effort to assemble doctor and facility details through Michael Ditto Jr.\u2019s MyChart (to obtain exact names and dates of doctors) and to determine whether the primary care physician is affiliated with Norton Dutchman. The team planned to proceed with record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urologist as soon as possible and to obtain copies of records from all involved departments and physicians.\n\nCameal (the individual who completed the Minor Intake) provided key biographical and factual details. She confirmed that she and Michael Ditto Sr. are married, that Michael Jr. lives in their home, and that he was born at Norton Dutchman Ln. She stated the initial circumcision occurred on 04/11/2023 and that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record any problems or complaints in her notes regarding Michael Jr. She reported filing a complaint with Norton Dutchman Hospital (with reference to the complaint and a contact number) and a complaint to Michael\u2019s primary care at six weeks, stating that Michael was in pain and that the circumcision was not progressing well, and that they were referred to a urologist at Norton Dutchman location who has extensive notes.\n\nCameal also noted that she and Michael Sr are married, that Michael Jr. was born 04/07/2023 and was in ICU at Norton Hospital, and that the Downtown location was a question in the intake. She indicated that the family\u2019s intent is to have Norton Hospital and Norton Urology\u2019s records obtained and to place Norton Healthcare on Notice, with the understanding that this process may take 30\u201345 days to secure records and a proper response.\n\nThe record of the exchange includes the exchange of contact details for Norton-related providers, including Elisha McAmont, a urologist located at 3999 Dutchman Ln, Suite 6F, Louisville, KY 40207, noted in the thread as having substantial documentation on Michael Jr. The thread also references Norton Urology and Norton Hospital Dutchman as primary targets for record requests, the need to obtain copies of all of Michael Jr.\u2019s medical records, and the intention to pursue notices with Norton Healthcare while documentation is gathered. In sum, the team is actively requesting comprehensive records from Norton Hospital Dutchman, Norton Urology, and associated departments and physicians, seeking health insurance information (noting United Insurance) and using MyChart to identify treating clinicians, with custody and guardianship considerations acknowledged as part of the minor\u2019s case.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents the email exchanges on December 13, 2024, concerning Michael Ditto Jr., a minor whose case is listed as Michael-Ditto-Jr-Med-Mal-04-11-2023. The client is Michael Ditto. The discussions involve KillA StyleS (reddcameal@gmail.com) and Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nEarly in the thread, an email from KillA StyleS to Sarena Tuttle references that Elisha McAmont, a urologist, is located at 3999 Dutchman Lane, Suite 6F, Louisville, KY 40207, and notes that there was a substantial amount of documentation regarding Michael Jr. The message also records that the primary care was at Stonestreet (ZIP 40272), and that there was an effort to access Michael Norton\u2019s MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of doctors. In addition, KillA mentions that Michael Sr. and Michael Jr. have a connection to Norton Dutchman and Norton Hospital, and that a complaint had been filed with Norton regarding the circumcision issue.\n\nSarena Tuttle\u2019s response, sent on December 13, 2024 around 2:40 PM, expresses the hope that Michael Jr.\u2019s records will contain everything needed. She asks whether United Insurance is Michael\u2019s health insurance and requests a copy of any health insurance coverage he has. She also notes that she has sent a request to Norton and that they will keep KillA posted as things progress. She identifies herself with her full title and contact information at The Whaley Law Firm and notes her new email address.\n\nEarlier in the same day, KillA provides continuing details about the case. There is a line about \u201cElisha McAmont urologist\u201d and the address cited earlier, and KillA reiterates that there is a lot of documentation on Michael Jr. She indicates she is providing or has provided information about the urologist and associated records.\n\nAround 2:09 PM, Sarena replies again to confirm that she will also send a record request to Norton Hospital and Norton Urologist. She requests that any information be sent as it becomes available, since they already have enough to begin work and will request records from all departments and physicians as needed. She reiterates the role and contact details for herself at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nAt about 2:05 PM, KillA notes the primary care is at Stonestreet and that she is attempting to access Michael Norton\u2019s MyChart to obtain exact names and dates of doctors for the file.\n\nAt approximately 1:59 PM, Sarena replies with appreciation for the information and explains that she will update the file and issue record requests to Norton Hospital Dutchman and Norton Urologist as soon as possible. She asks whether Michael\u2019s Primary Care Physician is also with Norton Dutchman.\n\nAt around 1:50 PM, KillA confirms a marital relationship: she and Michael Ditto Sr. are married, reside together, and that Michael Jr. was born at Norton Dutchman Lane location. She states that she immediately complained about the initial circumcision date of 4/11/23, noting that Heather Gusic, APRN, did not record any problems or complaints in her notes for Michael Jr.\u2019s file. She reports filing a complaint with Norton\u2019s Dutchman Hospital (the number 502-559-4490 is listed) and says Norton Dutchman Hospital offered to pay for Michael Jr.\u2019s re-circumcision and repair surgery on 12/12/23. She mentions that she complained at Michael\u2019s six-week check-up with his primary care about pain and that the circumcision was not going well, and that they referred her to his urologist at the Norton Dutchman location who has extensive notes on everything.\n\nEarlier still, at 1:27 PM, Sarena had written to Cameal (KillA) with several substantive questions. She asked for confirmation of Michael Ditto Sr.\u2019s relationship to Michael Jr. (whether they are married, and if not, whether custody has been decided by a family court and whether Michael Sr. is actively involved in Michael Jr.\u2019s life). She noted that custody is relevant for a minor claim. She asked for clarification that Michael was born on 04/07/2023 and was in the ICU at Norton Hospital, asking whether this was the Downtown location. She inquired whether 04/11/2023 was the date Michael was to have a routine circumcision but that an issue was found at the first primary care check-up, and asked who the primary care physician was. She also asked whether Michael was then referred for a revision surgery (appearing to be in December 2023), who completed the revision surgery, and whether there were records of complaints filed with Norton. She requested a complete list of all other treatments, surgeries, therapy, or follow-up visits and all doctors Michael has seen. She explained that once the requested information is received, the firm would issue medical record requests to obtain copies of all Michael\u2019s medical records and place Norton Healthcare on notice of the claim. She cautioned that the process can take 30-45 days to obtain records and a proper response from Norton Healthcare, and invited further questions as progress continued. She signed off with her title and contact information for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn sum, the December 13, 2024 exchanges reflect ongoing steps to gather Michael Ditto Jr.\u2019s medical records and health insurance information, confirm care providers and locations (including Norton Dutchman Hospital and the Norton Urologist, with a referenced involvement of Heather Gusic APRN and observer notes from an urologist), and to determine custody and familial involvement in Michael Jr.\u2019s case. The law firm intends to place Norton Healthcare on notice of the claim and to obtain all relevant records, acknowledging that the record collection process may take 30-45 days and requesting patience while the process unfolds.",
