      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. Client: Debra Marshall.\n\nThe notes chronicle Debra Marshall\u2019s auto collision case and the surrounding firm communications. The file begins with an urgent follow-up thread in January 2023. On January 17, 2023, Aaron Whaley from Whaley Law Firm sent a forward titled \u201cDebra Marshall | Urgent Follow Up Requested.\u201d In that message, he asked that the firm reach out to Debra and instructed Debra not to communicate with the other driver\u2019s insurance company. He noted that the other insurer had assigned fault to Debra, but he did not believe the fault was 100% on Debra and said he would handle matters with Kentucky Farm Bureau (KFB).\n\nThat same day, the message was a forward of a prior email from Farrokh Mokhtar, who was the Client Services Manager at LHP Law Group, PLLC. Mokhtar wrote that Debra had contacted them after receiving paperwork from the other driver's insurance company. He requested that Whaley\u2019s team follow up with the insurer and also asked them to obtain the insurer\u2019s office number for Debra. Mokhtar attached signed documents to his response. He signaled that the documents were part of the client\u2019s intake and that a cooperative follow-up was needed. In his signature block, he identified himself and provided his contact information: Farrokh Mokhtar, Client Services Manager, LHP Law Group, PLLC, 805-509-2504 (cell), farrokhm@lhplawgroup.com.\n\nThis January 17 thread sits atop a longer December 2022\u2013January 2023 communication trail about Debra Marshall\u2019s potential representation and the administrative steps involved in onboarding her case. Several earlier exchanges document notary coordination and firm onboarding. For example, on December 29\u201330, 2022, there was a sequence in which Debra Marshall was being integrated as a client for notary services.\n\n- On December 29, 2022, a chain of internal and client-facing messages discussed whether Debra Marshall would be entered as a client with LHP Law Group, and whether to submit documents under LHP. A note indicated that the Express Notary Service did not have Whaley on file as a client at that time. The Express Notary representative, Luke Vafiades, replied that they did not have Whaley on file and reminded recipients about the confidential nature of the email and its attachments.\n\n- Earlier that same day, there were communications between Jay Rodriguez (and others at Whaley Law Firm) and Farrokh Mokhtar about who would sign and how to proceed. Jay Rodriguez confirmed that Debra Marshall had agreed to a Notary appointment for tomorrow, December 30, at 10:30 a.m., confirming the address as 1224 N Dixie Hwy, Apt 1, Cave City, KY 42127, with the contact phone number (270) 612-0090. The retainer was attached to this email. The exchange also communicated the client\u2019s English language preference.\n\n- A message from Farrokh Mokhtar at 12:13 PM on December 30 indicated that Debra Marshall had signed with a notary that morning and that the firm would welcome her to the practice once they received the documents. Mokhtar stated he would send over the documents as soon as they were received.\n\n- On December 29, 2022, at 2:50 PM, an alert from the Alert Call Center noted: \u201cWHALEY POTENTIAL CLIENT \u2013 AUTO ACCIDENT (FURTHER REVIEW NEEDED).\u201d The note left the reason for further review as partially obscured (marked \u201cUnsure wh\u2026\u201d in the forwarded snippet), reflecting an initial status of uncertainty about this being Whaley\u2019s client and about how to file the matter.\n\n- Also on December 29, 2022, at 2:59 PM, Express Notary asked: \u201cHi, are we entering this as a LHP signing?\u201d In a prior thread at 2:00 PM that day, Aaron Whaley replied, \u201cNo, Whaley Law firm.\u201d Earlier, at 1:46 PM, Jay Rodriguez had stated that Debra Marshall had agreed to a notary appointment for 12/30 and provided the client\u2019s details (first name Debra, last name Marshall, language English, telephone number, and address). The notary appointment details, along with the statement that the retainer had been attached, were reiterated.\n\n- Finally, at 3:02 PM on December 29, 2022, an email from a Whaley-affiliated note asked to \u201csubmit under LHP and use the doc Jay sent over,\u201d indicating a procedural step to route Debra\u2019s matter through LHP Law Group\u2019s intake and notary process, rather than the Whaley firm directly.\n\nTaken together, these notes show that Debra Marshall\u2019s MVA case, initially arising in early December 2022, progressed through notary onboarding and intake coordination between Whaley Law Firm and LHP Law Group, with the latter coordinating signings and the transfer of documents. By late December, Debra had agreed to a notary appointment for December 30, 2022, at 10:30 a.m. at the Cave City address provided, and the retainer was attached to the correspondence. Express Notary was involved in the process, with some questions about whether the engagement would be filed under LHP or Whaley, and a request that a notary signature be obtained and documents be exchanged.\n\nBy mid-January 2023, the emphasis shifted to urgent client outreach and insurance communications. Debra had reportedly received paperwork from the other driver's (OD\u2019s) insurance company, prompting Farrokh Mokhtar and the LHP team to request that Whaley\u2019s team contact the client and coordinate follow-up with the insurer, including obtaining the insurer\u2019s office number for Debra. The January 17 communication also notes that Farrokh had attached signed documents to his reply and reiterates the plan to handle the matter with KFB, while the Whaley team prepared to engage with Debra directly and advise her to refrain from communicating with the other insurer.\n\nIn summary: Debra Marshall\u2019s case is the Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022 file. The organizational history includes onboarding activities with LHP Law Group in December 2022, notary appointment scheduling and completion around December 29\u201330, 2022, and an urgent follow-up thread in January 2023 in which Whaley urged direct client contact and cautioned against contacting the other insurer, with LHP coordinating follow-up and providing signed documents to support engagement. The January 17, 2023, exchange also indicates that Debra had received paperwork from the OD\u2019s insurer and that the team would address fault considerations (noting that Debra\u2019s fault was not believed to be 100% hers) and would handle matters with KFB.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. Client: Debra Marshall. This note summarizes the email chain from September 27, 2023, concerning Debra Marshall\u2019s motor vehicle accident case (MVA) with a December 3, 2022 incident date, and the preparation of a complaint draft.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, at 11:26:24 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aaron Whaley (and with Bryce Koon and Debra Marshall CC\u2019d) asking whether she should proceed to send an Open Records Request for dash-cam footage or similar camera footage. Sarena\u2019s message preceded the firm\u2019s internal discussion about next steps and the potential inspection of video from the scene. Her signature notes her role and includes her contact information and a new email address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Bryce Koon had sent a message around 10:39 a.m. noting that Bodily Injury (BI) liability had been denied and commenting that the case \u201cseems like it could have some teeth but not totally sure.\u201d Bryce added that the complaint draft was attached for review.\n\nIn the subsequent reply at approximately 11:04 a.m., Aaron Whaley replied that the case was a good one to file, indicating that he had saved the accident location from the police report to the case summary. He explained that a quick look at the location could show that Debra had progressed a short distance down the street before being struck. He advised obtaining open records for dash-cam or body-cam footage and expressed an interest in seeing video of the scene.\n\nA follow-up reply around 11:07 a.m. from Aaron stated, \u201cDon\u2019t file yet. I want to get a demand out. If this is a minimum policy then they may just tender. It\u2019s worth a few conversations with the adjuster.\u201d This indicated a strategy to pursue a settlement demand before filing, depending on the policy limits and potential tender by the insurer.\n\nThe thread thus reflects a plan to file a complaint draft (with Bryce noting BI\u2019s denial of liability and indicating the draft was attached for review), alongside consideration of obtaining open records for dash-cam or body-cam footage to illuminate the scene. The discussion also shows a strategy to first present a demand, particularly if the policy is not generous, before pursuing formal filing. Debra Marshall is the client, and her email address is included in the CC line along with the other participants. The firm\u2019s contact details appear in the signatures, and Sarena notes a new email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. The client is Debra Marshall, and this matter concerns a motor vehicle accident that occurred on December 3, 2022. The document is a Re: Debra Marshall - Complaint Draft, reflecting internal firm communications dated September 27, 2023, at 11:27:04 AM Eastern Time. The message was sent by Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle, with cc to Bryce Koon and Debra Marshall.\n\nThe body of Aaron\u2019s initial email simply contained the word \u201cyes.\u201d In a preceding thread, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, asked whether she should proceed with sending an Open Records Request (ORR) for camera footage, specifically dash cam or body cam video, to obtain footage of the scene. Sarena\u2019s contact details are listed as The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. She also noted her new email address.\n\nEarlier messages in the thread show Aaron advising: Do not file yet; he wants to issue a demand first, noting that if the at-fault policy is minimum, the insurer may tender without further pressure, and suggesting a few conversations with the adjuster. In a subsequent message, Aaron indicated that it was a good case to file and that he had saved the crash location from the police report to the case summary. He advised obtaining open records for dash cam or body cam footage and expressed a desire to see video of the scene.\n\nBryce Koon, another member of The Whaley Law Firm, commented that Bodily Injury (BI) liability had been denied and stated, \u201cdenied liability here \u2014 seems like it could have some teeth but not totally sure.\u201d Bryce also noted that the complaint draft had been attached for review.\n\nThe thread closes with the signature block for Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm, including the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the contact number 502-583-4022.

Re: Debra Marshall - Complaint Draft.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, in the Debra Marshall motor vehicle accident matter, an email thread was exchanged regarding the draft of Debra Marshall\u2019s complaint. The message originated from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and was sent to Aaron Whaley with Bryce Koon and Debra Marshall cc\u2019d. The subject line read \u201cRe: Debra Marshall - Complaint Draft.\u201d The header information notes the date as September 27, 2023 at 11:36:55 AM, with a -0400 time zone.\n\nIn the body of the initial note, Sarena reports that she called Cave City Police Department to obtain ORR instructions. Per Chief Miller, the department does not use dash cams or body cameras. Sarena\u2019s signature block follows, including her role and contact details and a note indicating her email address is the new one: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe thread then shows a rapid back-and-forth. Around 11:27 AM, Aaron Whaley replied with a brief \u201cyes.\u201d Moments earlier, at approximately 11:26 AM, Sarena asked, \u201cShould I go ahead and send ORR for cam footage?\u201d followed by her signature block.\n\nEarlier still, at about 11:07 AM, Aaron advised, \u201cDon\u2019t file yet. I want to get a demand out. If this is a minimum policy then they may just tender. It is worth a few conversations with the adjuster.\u201d This comment followed an earlier exchange captured in the thread.\n\nAt approximately 10:39 AM, Bryce Koon contributed, noting, \u201cBI denied liability here ? seems like it could have some teeth but not totally sure.\u201d He also stated that the complaint draft was attached for review, and he signed as Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, providing his contact details.\n\nThe thread contains multiple closing sign-offs from Aaron Whaley, all identifying him as with The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number, 502-583-4022, repeated in the signature blocks.

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022 documents Debra Marshall as the client in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on December 3, 2022. The file includes a forwarded urgent follow-up from December 21, 2023, in which the sender states: \u201cPlease call Debra Marshall. Looks like she may have gotten a summons.\u201d The forward is part of an email thread sent by Aaron Whaley to Bryce Koon, Sarena Tuttle, and Debra Marshall\u2019s file link, with the subject Debra Marshall | Urgent Follow Up Requested and the timestamp Thursday, December 21, 2023 at 14:15:45 Eastern Time.\n\nWithin that 2023 forwarding, a prior message from Farrokh Mokhtar is summarized: \u201cMr. Grant needs to speak with Justin regarding a summons they received today. Could you please have someone reach out to him ASAP?\u201d A phone number is provided: 270-308-6916. The message is addressed to Aaron Whaley and Brandon at Whaley Law Firm, with Mark Sullivan copied from LHP Law Group, and it is signed by Farrokh Mokhtar, Client Services Manager, LHP Law Group, PLLC (contact information included in the signature block).\n\nThe thread also contains a series of earlier communications dating back to 2023 and 2022. On January 17, 2023, Farrokh Mokhtar wrote to Aaron Whaley and others: \u201cThe client reached out to us because they received some paperwork from the OD\u2019s insurance company. Could you please have your team follow up with them? Please also request them to provide the client with the office number.\u201d Mokhtar noted that signed documents were attached to the response. On January 26, 2023, Mokhtar again stated that they were continuing to receive calls and that it appears the other party is attempting to send over some of the requested documents; he asked that their Case Manager reach out to the client and ensure a direct number was provided.\n\nTurning to December 2022, the thread shows that on December 29, 2022, Jay Rodriguez advised that Debra Marshall had agreed to a notary appointment for tomorrow, December 30, at 10:30 AM, and he confirmed the address and time. He provided Debra\u2019s basic client details: first name Debra, last name Marshall, language English, and telephone number (270)612-0090. He also listed the appointment address as 1224 N Dixie Hwy, Apt 1, Cave City, KY 42127, and he stated that the retainer had been attached to the email. Earlier that same day, a message from an Express Notary Service representative (Luke Vafiades) indicated that Whaley was not on file as a client, and asked whether this should be entered as a LHP signing. This exchange included the line: \u201cWe don\u2019t have Whaley on file as a client as far as I can tell.\u201d Another message, sent at 2:00 PM, clarified: \u201cNo, Whaley Law firm.\u201d A subsequent note at 2:59 PM asked, \u201cHi, are we entering this as a LHP signing?\u201d and later, at 3:02 PM, a reply from the legal team instructed to submit under LHP and to use the document Jay sent over.\n\nIn a follow-up to that same day, Jay Rodriguez replied at 1:46 PM that Debra Marshall had agreed to a notary appointment for tomorrow, confirmed her address and time, and noted that the retainer had been attached. The 3:02 PM messages from Farrokh Mokhtar reiterated the need to process the matter in the correct system (LHP) and to use the doc Jay had provided. By December 30, 2022 at 12:13 PM, Mokhtar reported that Debra and her party had signed with a notary that morning and requested that someone reach out to welcome them to the firm, with a promise to send over documents as soon as they were received. The thread also confirms the broader collaboration between the Whaley firm and LHP Law Group, PLLC, including the presence of Express Notary Service communications and the involvement of multiple staff members (Intake, Mark Rinehart, Mark Sullivan, Gigi Andueza, Diana Diaz, Elena Dunne, Sarah Peters, Kalli Erickson, and others) in facilitating the notary process and document handling.\n\nIn summary, the Debra Marshall case involves an MVA from December 3, 2022, with a multi-organization correspondence trail spanning December 2022 through January 2023, detailing notary arrangements, document handling, insurer paperwork, and client follow-up. A further urgent follow-up note from December 21, 2023 indicates Debra may have received a summons, and directs contact with Debra, including a separate note that Mr. Grant needs to speak with Justin regarding the summons, with Justin\u2019s phone number listed as 270-308-6916. Debra Marshall\u2019s contact details documented in the thread include a telephone number of (270) 612-0090 and an address at 1224 N Dixie Hwy, Apt 1, Cave City, KY 42127.",

      "natural_language": "This note covers the Debra Marshall matter arising from Debra Marshall\u2019s motor vehicle accident case, captioned as Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. The relevant filings and communications concern the district court action KFBMIC (a/s/0 Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall, Barren District Court case number 23-C-01110, and the client is Debra Marshall.\n\nOn December 27, 2023, in an email to John Bertram, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, stated that all of Bertram\u2019s presumptions were correct. Koon informed Bertram that they had filed a circuit court action against Jasmine Reed, who drove Ms. Renick\u2019s vehicle, in Circuit Court. The circuit court case number is 23-CI-00659. Reed was served via certified mail on December 13, 2023, but no answer has been filed to date. Koon explained his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case, and he asked Bertram to indicate any objections to the attached motion; if there were none, Koon would draft an agreed order. The message included Koon\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email also contained the standard privilege disclaimer stating the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; recipients who are not intended to receive the message should notify The Whaley Law Firm, and should not use or forward the information.\n\nEarlier, Bertram had replied on December 27, 2023, at 9:37 a.m. that he had been advised a separate matter had been filed in the Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and that his understanding was that Koon\u2019s firm initiated that action. Bertram asked Koon to confirm his understanding and, if correct, whether the matters should be consolidated. He noted a potential difference in damages (district court versus circuit court) but suggested judicial economy might support consolidation. Bertram also asked whether an answer had been filed in the matter Koon had initiated. Bertram\u2019s signature included his contact details: John D. Bertram, (270) 789-3676. The CC list on the message included Sarena Tuttle, Allan R. Bertram, Debby Bennett, and Landon Cambron.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, at 2:05 p.m., Koon sent another message to Bertram with Allan R. Bertram copied, attaching documents that had been filed that day in Barren District Court and noting, \u201cPlease see attached filed today in Barren District Court.\u201d The message again carried The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nIn the later message from December 27, 2023, at 10:01 a.m., Koon reiterated that all of Bertram\u2019s presumptions were correct: a circuit court action against Jasmine Reed had been filed, case number 23-CI-00659, with Reed served by certified mail on December 13, 2023, and no answer filed to date. He confirmed his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case and indicated that, if Bertram had no objections to the attached motion, he could draft an agreed order. The signature block again included Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm and the customary attorney-disclaimer language.\n\nOverall, the communications reflect that a separate circuit court action was filed against Jasmine Reed related to the same facts, service of process on Reed occurred on December 13, 2023 with no answer yet, and there is an ongoing plan to consolidate the district court case 23-C-01110 into the circuit court action, with an attached motion on file and a potential agreed order to be drafted if there are no objections. The exchanges were between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and John D. Bertram, with multiple cc recipients, and they include standard attorney-client privilege notices in the signature blocks.",

      "natural_language": "Debra Marshall was involved in a motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022. In late December 2023, her case surfaced in two related filings arising from that incident. The Whaley Law Firm, on behalf of KFBMIC (Kentucky Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company) in a matter captioned KFBMIC (a/s/0 Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall, filed a case in Barren District Court against Debra Marshall, assigned District Court case number 23-C-01110. This action is part of the Debra Marshall MVA case referenced as Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, counsel for KFBMIC advised that a circuit court action had been filed against Jasmine Reed, driver of Edie Renick\u2019s vehicle, in the Barren Circuit Court, with Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed was served with the circuit court action via certified mail on December 13, 2023, and, at that time, no answer had been filed. The email indicated an intent to move to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case, and that, if there were no objections, an agreed order could be drafted.\n\nThe next day, December 27, 2023, John D. Bertram inquired by email whether the firm would be defending in the circuit court matter and whether the matters should be consolidated, noting a likely difference in damages between district court and circuit court actions but citing judicial economy as a reason to consolidate. He also asked whether an answer had been filed in the matter initiated by KFBMIC.\n\nBryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied on December 27, 2023, confirming that the circuit court action had indeed been filed against Jasmine Reed, Case No. 23-CI-00659, and that Reed had been served by certified mail on December 13, 2023, with no answer having been filed to date. He stated his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case (23-C-01110) into the circuit court case (23-CI-00659) and offered to draft an agreed order if there were no objections.\n\nShortly thereafter, Bertram responded that he had been advised of the separate circuit court filing arising from the same facts and asked Koon to confirm whether his understanding was correct and whether the matters should be consolidated. He again noted the potential difference in damages between district and circuit court actions but suggested consolidation could serve judicial economy, and he asked whether an answer had been filed in the matter initiated by KFBMIC.\n\nAt 10:47 a.m. on December 27, 2023, a forwarded message from Bryce Koon circulated the preceding exchange. The forwarded content reiterates Bertram\u2019s inquiry about consolidation and reflects KFBMIC\u2019s stance that the district court case (23-C-01110) and the circuit court case (23-CI-00659) were being coordinated, with the possibility of an agreed order if there were no objections. The message also includes the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of communications from The Whaley Law Firm and the sender\u2019s contact information, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information; recipients receiving the message in error are instructed to notify The Whaley Law Firm, avoid waiving privileges, and not to disclose the content to others.\n\nIn summary, in December 2023, two related actions emerged from the same underlying facts: a district court case in Barren District Court against Debra Marshall (23-C-01110) and a circuit court case against Jasmine Reed (23-CI-00659). Reed was served on December 13, 2023, with no answer filed, and counsel discussed consolidating the district and circuit court matters, with the possibility of drafting an agreed order pending any objections.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. Client: Debra Marshall. The matter captioned KFBMIC (a/s/0 Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall was filed in Barren District Court under docket number 23-C-01110. \n\nOn January 15, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a good\u2011afternoon message to John Bertram at BCM LLP, with copies to Sarena Tuttle, Allan R. Bertram, Debby Bennett, and Landon Cambron. In that email, he wrote that he had attached documents filed that day in Barren District Court and invited Mr. Bertram to contact him with any questions. The message also included standard attorney\u2011client privilege language indicating the electronic communication was intended only for the named recipient and warning against disclosure if received in error. Koon\u2019s signature block provided his firm\u2019s name and contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365\u20115043; fax (502) 364\u20119363.\n\nThe sequence of prior correspondence began on December 26, 2023, when Bryce Koon emailed John Bertram with the subject noting KFBMIC v. Debra Marshall in the Barren District Court. In that message, Koon stated, \u201cPlease see attached filed today in Barren District Court,\u201d and again attached materials were referenced along with the standard privilege notice.\n\nEarlier on December 27, 2023, at 9:37 AM, John Bertram replied. He indicated that he had been advised a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and that his understanding was that KFBMIC initiated that action. He asked for confirmation of his understanding and inquired whether he and the firm agreed that the matters should be consolidated. He noted a possible difference in damages (district vs. circuit) but suggested judicial economy might argue for consolidation, and he asked whether an answer had been filed in the matter Koon initiated.\n\nFollowing Bertram\u2019s inquiry, Bryce Koon responded on December 27, 2023 at 10:02 AM. He confirmed that Bertram\u2019s presumptions were correct: The Whaley Law Firm had filed a circuit court action against Jasmine Reed, the driver of the Renick vehicle, in Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed had been served via certified mail on December 13, 2023, but no answer had been filed to date. Koon stated his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case and, if Bertram did not object to the attached motion, he could draft an agreed order.\n\nAt 10:23 AM on December 27, 2023, John Bertram replied to Bryce Koon\u2019s latest message. He said he had been informed that a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and he reiterated his understanding that KFBMIC initiated that action. He asked whether the matters should be consolidated and suggested there might be a difference in damages between the district and circuit courts, but he believed consolidation would be appropriate for judicial economy. He also asked whether an answer had been filed in the circuit matter initiated by Koon.\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another email to John Bertram, stating, \u201cGood afternoon John, Please see attached filed today in Barren District Court. Please let me know if you have any questions.\u201d The email followed the same pattern as prior communications, including the confidential/privilege notice and Koon\u2019s firm contact details (Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365\u20115043; fax (502) 364\u20119363).\n\nIn summary, the parties have been coordinating on the relationship between the district court case 23-C-01110 (Debra Marshall v. KFBMIC/Edie Renick) and a separately filed circuit court action against Jasmine Reed (driver of the Renick vehicle) in Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed was served on December 13, 2023, by certified mail with no answer filed as of the latest communications. There has been explicit discussion of consolidating the district court case into the circuit court case, with indications that Koon would prepare an agreed order if Bertram did not object. The correspondence chain includes multiple exchanges between Bryce Koon and John Bertram, with CCs to Sarena Tuttle, Allan R. Bertram, Debby Bennett, and Landon Cambron, and each message carried the customary attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer.",

      "natural_language": "Debra Marshall is the client in a motor vehicle accident case referenced as Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. The matter at hand concerns KFBMIC (a/s/o Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall, currently in Barren District Court as case number 23-C-01110. The correspondence shown here spans late December 2023 into January 2024 and involves W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and John D. Bertram, Esq., with several counsel and staff copied on the messages.\n\nOn December 26, 2023, Bryce Koon sent an email to John Bertram with the subject RE: KFBMIC (a/s/o Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall (Barren District Court 23-C-01110). In that message, Koon stated that all counsel should see the attached document filed that day in Barren District Court and invited any questions. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky contact information included, and the email contained the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on December 27, 2023, John Bertram replied at 9:37 AM. He said he had been advised that a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, apparently arising from the same facts, and he asked Bryce to confirm whether his understanding was correct and whether the matters should be consolidated. Bertram noted that he presumed there would be a difference in damages (district versus circuit court) but suggested that judicial economy might favor consolidation, and he asked whether an answer had been filed in the matter initiated by Bryce\u2019s firm.\n\nBryce Koon responded at 10:02 AM the same day. He confirmed that Bertram\u2019s presumptions were correct: a circuit court action had been filed against Jasmine Reed (the driver of the vehicle involved in Edie Renick\u2019s claim), identified as Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed was served via certified mail on December 13, 2023, but no answer had been filed to date. Koon stated his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case and offered to draft an agreed order if Bertram had no objections to the attached motion.\n\nShortly after, at 10:23 AM on December 27, 2023, John Bertram replied again. He thanked Bryce and said he was not sure whether KFBMIC would be defending in the circuit court matter but had inquired. He indicated he would inform Bryce if there was any opposition to consolidation, though he could not imagine there would be.\n\nThe thread also shows an additional message from Bryce on December 27, 2023, to John Bertram (9:37 AM) and a follow-up at 9:37 AM from Bertram, indicating ongoing discussion about consolidation and the relative timing of the actions. Earlier, on December 26, 2023, Bryce had again referenced the attached filing in Barren District Court.\n\nOn January 15, 2024, Bryce Koon sent a further update to John Bertram. In a message dated Monday, January 15, 2024, at 14:34:12 Eastern Time, Koon wrote: Good afternoon, John. Please see the attached document filed today in Barren District Court regarding the KFBMIC matter (a/s/o Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall (23-C-01110). He asked John to let him know if there were any questions. The email was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone and fax numbers listed. As with the prior messages, the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer appeared at the bottom of the email.\n\nIn summary, the file reflects Debra Marshall\u2019s representation in the district court case 23-C-01110, with a parallel circuit court action against Jasmine Reed in Case No. 23-CI-00659. There were ongoing discussions about consolidating the district court case into the circuit court matter, including service on Jasmine Reed (via certified mail on 12/13/2023) and no answer filed to date, as of December 2023. The most recent filed filing in district court was noted on January 15, 2024, with Bryce Koon advising that the attached document had been filed and inviting questions. The communications include multiple CC\u2019d recipients and the standard privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022\nClient: Debra Marshall\n\nThe note records a series of email exchanges concerning the caption KFBMIC (a/s/0 Edie Renick) v. Debra Marshall, pending in Barren District Court under docket 23-C-01110. The matter involves Debra Marshall as the client and Edie Renick\u2019s related claim. The communications ran from late December 2023 through mid-January 2024 and included two law firms: John D. Bertram of Bertram, Camm & Bertram LLP (BCM LLP) representing Debra Marshall, and W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm representing KFBMIC. The discussions focused on whether district court and circuit court cases arising from the same facts should be consolidated, and on the status of filings and service.\n\nChronology and key details\n- December 26, 2023, 9:37 a.m. (To: Bryce Koon; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): John D. Bertram wrote, Good morning. He stated that he had been advised a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and that he understood KFBMIC\u2019s firm initiated that action. He asked John\u2019s counterpart to confirm this understanding and whether the matters should be consolidated. He noted a presumed difference in damages (district court vs. circuit court) but suggested judicial economy might warrant consolidation, and he inquired whether an answer had been filed in the circuit matter.\n\n- December 26, 2023, 2:05 p.m. (To: John Bertram; CC: Allan R. Bertram; Sarena Tuttle; Debby Bennett): Bryce Koon replied, stating that all of John\u2019s presumptions were correct. He advised that a circuit court action had been filed against Jasmine Reed (the driver of Edie Renick\u2019s vehicle) with Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed had been served via certified mail on December 13, 2023, but no answer had been filed to date. Bryce indicated his intention to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case and asked whether John had any objections to the attached motion; he also offered to draft an agreed order.\n\n- December 27, 2023, 9:37 a.m. (To: Bryce Koon; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): John Bertram sent a follow-up, Good morning. He reiterated that a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and that Bryce\u2019s firm had initiated that action. He asked for confirmation and whether the matters should be consolidated, noting the potential damages difference and the possible efficiency gains from consolidation. He also asked whether an answer had been filed in the circuit matter.\n\n- December 27, 2023, 10:02 a.m. (To: John Bertram; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): Bryce Koon replied, Good morning John. He stated that all of John\u2019s presumptions were correct: a circuit court action had been filed against Jasmine Reed (driver of Ms. Renick\u2019s vehicle) \u2013 Case No. 23-CI-00659. Reed was served via certified mail on December 13, 2023, and no answer had been filed to date. Bryce indicated his intent to file a motion to consolidate the district court case into the circuit court case and offered to draft an agreed order if John had no objections to the attached motion.\n\n- December 27, 2023, 10:23 a.m. (To: Bryce Koon; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): John Bertram responded, Good morning. He said he had been advised that a separate matter had been filed in Barren Circuit Court, presumably arising from the same facts, and reiterated his understanding that Bryce\u2019s firm initiated that action. He asked for confirmation and whether the matters should be consolidated. He noted a presumed difference in damages (district vs. circuit) but believed judicial economy might favor consolidation. He also asked whether an answer had been filed in the circuit matter.\n\n- December 26\u201327, 2023: The emails reference an attached filing in Barren District Court (from Bryce\u2019s December 26 message) and discuss the existence and status of a circuit court action against Jasmine Reed (Case No. 23-CI-00659) with service recorded on December 13, 2023 and no answer filed yet. The parties repeatedly considered filing a motion to consolidate the district and circuit court actions and whether an agreed order could be drafted.\n\n- January 15, 2024, 2:34 p.m. (From: Bryce Koon; To: John Bertram; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): Bryce wrote Good afternoon, John. He asked him to see the attached filing in Barren District Court, noting that it had been filed that day. He invited any questions.\n\n- January 15, 2024, 7:41 p.m. (From: John D. Bertram; To: Bryce Koon; CC: Sarena Tuttle; Allan R. Bertram; Debby Bennett; Landon Cambron): John responded with simply \u201cThank you,\u201d followed by his standard signature block including his phone number (270) 789-3676.\n\nOther notable details\n- The parties\u2019 counsel and recipients were repeatedly cc\u2019d: Sarena Tuttle, Allan R. Bertram, Debby Bennett, and Landon Cambron, with the primary correspondence between John D. Bertram (BCM LLP) and W. Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm). The January 15, 2024 exchanges show the same group in the distribution.\n\n- Attachments and formatting: In the January 15, 2024 emails, Bryce\u2019s message referenced an attached filing in the Barren District Court (the message also included an image attachment noted as [cid:image001.png...]). The messages repeatedly stated they were confidential and attorney-client privileged, including standard notices about forwarding, privilege, and error handling.\n\n- Case context and status: The note confirms the district court case, 23-C-01110, involves Debra Marshall as the defendant in a matter arising from a motor vehicle accident (Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022). The circuit court action referenced, against Jasmine Reed, is in Case No. 23-CI-00659, with service by certified mail on December 13, 2023 and no filed answer at the time of the communications. The parties discussed consolidating the district court case into the circuit court action to promote efficiency.\n\n- The final entries (January 15, 2024) show a subsequent filing in the Barren District Court being communicated by Bryce to John, with John acknowledging receipt.\n\nOverall, the note captures the procedural posture of late December 2023 through January 2024: a district court filing by The Whaley Law Firm related to KFBMIC, a parallel or separate circuit court action against Jasmine Reed, service on Reed without an answer, ongoing discussions about consolidating the district and circuit court proceedings, and a later January 15, 2024 filing in the district court followed by a brief acknowledgment from John Bertram. Confidentiality notices accompany the messages, and the communications include the usual attorney-contact details and distribution lists.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed in the Barren Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-00659, arising from Debra Marshall\u2019s motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022. The client in this matter is Debra Marshall.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, at 8:53 a.m., W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, sent an email to hrh@scrtc.com with Sarena Tuttle copied, regarding Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (Barren Circuit 23-CI-00659). He noted that discovery requests had been served contemporaneously with the Complaint and asked for guidance on when responses might be provided, offering to supply the requests if needed and willing to grant an extension if necessary. He also informed that KFB, acting on Edie Renick\u2019s behalf, had filed a property damage claim in Barren District Court against his client. He had filed a motion to consolidate that case with the above-styled case, which would be heard that day and would likely face no objection. He closed with thanks and provided his contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363. The message carried the standard electronic privilege disclaimer indicating it was intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient was instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to disclose or forward the contents.\n\nLater that same day, January 26, 2024 at 12:45 p.m., Hensley & Ross responded to Bryce Koon. In their reply, Pat (Patrick) Hensley stated that he appreciated the agreement to grant additional time to respond to the discovery served with the complaint and requested another 30 days, which he believed would be sufficient. The message was sent from Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law, located at 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749, with phone 270-786-2155 and fax 270-786-2118. The response included the same standard electronic privilege disclaimer.\n\nAlso on January 23, 2024, Bryce Koon had previously written again, in a separate message sent at 8:53 a.m. to hrh@scrtc.com with Sarena Tuttle CC\u2019d, regarding the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed matter. He reminded Patrick that discovery requests were served with the Complaint and asked to be advised when responses might be expected; he reiterated willingness to provide the discovery documents or to request an extension if needed. He again referenced that KFB, on Edie Renick\u2019s behalf, had filed a property damage claim in Barren District Court against his client and that he had filed a motion to consolidate that case with the current action, which would be heard today and would likely face no objection. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the same Louisville address and contact details as above, and again included the standard electronic privilege disclaimer.\n\nIn summary, communications regarding Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (Barren Circuit 23-CI-00659) between January 23 and January 26, 2024 documented discovery response timing concerns, a contemporaneous property damage claim filed against Debra Marshall in Barren District Court (and a motion to consolidate), and a mutual agreement to extend deadlines by 30 days, with corresponding attorney acknowledgments and boilerplate privilege notices attached to each message.",

On January 23, 2024, Bryce Koon sent to Hensley & Ross at hrh@scrtc.com with Sarena Tuttle cc\u2019d, reasserting that discovery requests had been served contemporaneously with the Complaint. He asked Hensley & Ross to advise when the office could expect responses, and offered to provide the discovery documents if needed or to arrange an extension if required. In that same message, Koon noted that KFB, acting on behalf of Edie Renick, had filed a property-damage claim in Barren District Court against his client. He stated that he had filed a motion to consolidate that case with the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed matter, which would be heard that day and would likely face no objection. He invited any questions about the consolidation and the related matters. The message ended with thanks and his signature block, including The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and contact details, and it carried the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, at 12:05 PM, Bryce Koon responded to Hensley & Ross with the subject Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (Barren Circuit 23-CI-00659). He wrote that \u201c30 days should be fine,\u201d and again provided his contact information and the usual privilege disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, January 26, 2024, at 12:45 PM, Hensley & Ross replied to Bryce Koon. In the message, which began with \u201cBryce:,\u201d they thanked him for agreeing to grant additional time to respond to the discovery served with the complaint and requested that he give them \u201canother 30 days\u201d if possible. The reply was signed by Pat from Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law, with the firm\u2019s address at 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749, and contact information: phone 270-786-2155, fax 270-786-2118. The message also contained the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn January 29, 2024, at 12:26 PM, Hensley & Ross again emailed Bryce Koon in the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed matter. The body of that message consisted of a brief \u201cThanks,\u201d and, as with the other emails, included the firm\u2019s contact details and the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nAcross all messages in the thread, the subject consistently appeared as Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (Barren Circuit 23-CI-00659). The communications reflect discovery timing concerns and the parties\u2019 negotiations over extending deadlines for responses to discovery, as well as a contemporaneous notice of a related property-damage case and an attempted consolidation. The correspondence also shows ongoing attention to privilege protections in electronic communications.",

He offered to extend time if needed or to resend the discovery if necessary. Koon also noted that KFB (on behalf of Edie Renick) had filed a property damage claim in Barren District Court against his client, and that he had filed a motion to consolidate that case with the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed action, which was to be heard that day and would likely face no objection. He invited any questions and signed with his contact information and the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, at 12:05 PM, Koon replied to Hensley & Ross with: \u201c30 days should be fine.\u201d He again provided his contact details.

Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the usual contact information and privilege disclaimer.\n\nThat same day, March 19, 2024, at 4:46 PM, Hensley & Ross replied: \u201cLike always I am running behind. I will get in touch with her and get those answered within the near future.\u201d The message carried the firm\u2019s standard signature lines and disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on April 9, 2024, at 1:48 PM (Eastern Time, -0400), Bryce Koon sent another message to counsel: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I am writing again to determine when we may expect your client\u2019s discovery responses. It appears these requests have been outstanding for some time now.\u201d He concluded with his signature block for The Whaley Law Firm, Louisville, KY, and the same standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the subject line consistently referenced Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (Barren Circuit 23-CI-00659). The communications include the parties and counsel identified above, the case identity, the discovery timeline discussions, and the motion to consolidate a separate property damage claim filed in Barren District Court (KFB, on behalf of Edie Renick) with the Debra Marshall matter, all set against the backdrop of a motor vehicle accident occurring on December 3, 2022. Each email ends with the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer and the sender\u2019s contact information.",

      "natural_language": "In the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed case (Barren Circuit Court, docket 23-CI-00659), arising from a motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022, the client is Debra Marshall. The Whaley Law Firm, represented by W. Bryce Koon, began a series of discovery communications with Hensley & Ross, whose contact is Patrick (Pat) Hensley, concerning the discovery responses tied to the case.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, Bryce Koon emailed Pat Hensley at Hensley & Ross, noting that discovery requests had been served contemporaneously with the complaint and asking for an update on when the office could expect responses. He offered to provide the discovery documents if needed and invited an extension of time or for him to resend the materials. Bryce also informed Hensley & Ross that KFB (a/s/o Edie Renick) had filed a property damage claim in Barren District Court against his client, and that he had filed a motion to consolidate that case with the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed case, which would be heard that day and would likely face no objection. He signaled willingness to accommodate any questions and provided his contact details.\n\nSubsequently, on January 26, 2024, Bryce replied that 30 days would be fine. Pat Hensley responded later that day, thanking Bryce for agreeing to grant additional time to respond to the discovery served with the complaint and stating that another 30 days would be sufficient.\n\nAlso on January 26, 2024, Bryce sent another message in the same thread, and on January 29, 2024, Hensley & Ross replied with a brief \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nOn January 29, 2024, Bryce\u2019s message had been sent from The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363), and the Hensley & Ross firm responded from their office (207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749; phone 270-786-2155; fax 270-786-2118). The email disclaimers in these communications indicated that the messages were intended for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information, with instructions to contact the sender if received in error and not to disclose the contents.\n\nFast forwarding to March 2024, Bryce again sought an update. On March 19, 2024, at 10:39 AM, Bryce emailed Hensley & Ross again, asking for an update on the outstanding discovery requests and indicating that the message had been CC\u2019d to Debra Marshall\u2019s file (DebraMarshallZ3106052@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com).\n\nLater that same day, March 19, 2024 at 4:46 PM, Pat Hensley replied that he was running behind as usual but would contact Debra Marshall and arrange for the requested discovery to be answered in the near future.\n\nFinally, on April 9, 2024, 1:48 PM, Bryce wrote again to counsel, asking when the client\u2019s discovery responses could be expected, noting that the requests had been outstanding for some time. The message again carried the standard privilege disclaimer common to these communications.\n\nThese exchanges reflect a pattern of delayed discovery responses in the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed matter, with multiple extensions requested and granted, and ongoing efforts to coordinate related matters, including the consolidation of a separate property damage claim filed by KFB on Edie Renick\u2019s behalf.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed, in the Barren Circuit Court (case number 23-CI-00659). The matter stems from a motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022, and the client is Debra Marshall. Debra Marshall is represented by The Whaley Law Firm, with W. Bryce Koon, Esq., handling the matter. The following is a narrative summary of the discovery-related correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and Hensley & Ross, along with related context.\n\nIn late January 2024, The Whaley Law Firm began a series of communications regarding discovery. On January 23, 2024, Bryce Koon emailed Patrick Hensley of Hensley & Ross, noting that discovery requests had been served contemporaneously with the Complaint and asking when the responses could be expected. He offered to provide an extension if needed or to send the discovery requests himself. He also informed Hensley & Ross that KFB, acting for Edie Renick, had filed a property damage claim in Barren District Court against Debra Marshall. He indicated that he had filed a motion to consolidate that property damage case with the Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed matter, which would be heard that day and would likely face no objection. He invited any questions regarding these matters.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, at 12:05 PM, Bryce Koon replied that a 30-day extension would be fine. Later that day, at 12:45 PM, Hensley & Ross responded: \u201cBryce: Thank you for agreeing to grant me additional time to respond to the discovery served with the complaint. If you could give me another 30 days that should be sufficient.\u201d On January 29, 2024, at 12:26 PM, Hensley & Ross sent a brief acknowledgment: \u201cThanks.\u201d\n\nMoving forward, on March 19, 2024, at 10:39 AM, Bryce Koon asked for an update on the outstanding discovery requests. That same day, at 4:46 PM, Hensley & Ross replied: \u201cLike always I am running behind. I will get in touch with her and get those answered within the near future. Thanks.\u201d\n\nOn April 9, 2024, at 12:48 PM, Bryce Koon wrote again, stating: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I am writing again to determine when we may expect your client\u2019s discovery responses. It appears these requests have been outstanding for some time now.\u201d Later that day, at 2:34 PM, Hensley & Ross replied: \u201cI apologize for the delay. I have been having trouble getting in touch with my client. I will try a different avenue.\u201d\n\nFinally, on May 31, 2024, at 2:59 PM, Bryce Koon followed up once more: \u201cCounsel, It has been quite some time, so I thought I would follow up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect your client\u2019s discovery answers in this regard.\u201d Each message in this sequence contains the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of the sending firm.\n\nIn summary, the record shows a back-and-forth over several months (January through May 2024) concerning the timing of discovery responses in Debra Marshall\u2019s case against Jasmine Reed, with parallel reference to a related property damage claim involving Edie Renick and a motion to consolidate that claim with the Debra Marshall case. The exchanges reflect multiple extensions requested and granted, ongoing difficulties contacting the client, and repeated follow-ups from The Whaley Law Firm seeking production of discovery responses.",

      "natural_language": "In the Debra Marshall motor vehicle accident matter, Debra Marshall is the client in Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed, Barren Circuit Court case number 23-CI-00659, arising from a December 3, 2022 motor vehicle accident. The note documents a sequence of communications in October 2024 between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Hensley & Ross, with Debra Marshall copied on the Filevine project email address.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, at 09:46:29 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel at Hensley & Ross, to Sarena Tuttle, and to the Debra Marshall Filevine project email address. The subject line is not stated, but the body begins with \u201cGood morning counsel,\u201d and thanks them for their quick response. He states that attached is Plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Remand. He signs as \u201cW. Bryce Koon, Esq.\u201d of The Whaley Law Firm, providing the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. A standard attorney\u2011client confidentiality disclaimer follows, indicating the message is intended for the named recipient and advising what to do if received in error.\n\nEarlier on October 14, 2024, this thread shows the history of communications from October 10, 2024. In the afternoon, Hensley & Ross responded to Bryce Koon\u2019s prior messages with an apology. They stated that they had the signed interrogatories in the file but failed to file them and would do so in the morning. The message was from Pat at Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law, who provided the firm\u2019s contact information: 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749; phone (270) 786-2155 and fax (270) 786-2118. This message also included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nIn a prior exchange on October 10, 2024 at 2:48 p.m., Bryce Koon replied to Hensley & Ross, stating, \u201cMy apologies counselor, I have been informed that the motion hour date will be moved to 11/04/24 at 9am.\u201d His reply included the standard Whaley Law Firm signature block and contact information.\n\nEarlier still on October 10, 2024 at 1:44 p.m., Bryce Koon sent another message to counsel. He attached the Motion to Compel, noting that it had been filed that day and that the motion would be set for motion hour on Monday, October 21, 2024. He advised that if the opposing side supplied discovery responses before that date, they would remand their motion. He also attached Plaintiff\u2019s Confidential Settlement Demand and provided a Dropbox link to related documents: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sc5yapd7wxz1zqjpvrlot/ABJjIzaAnDXFHO1REH3gx94?rlkey=9tr5vm3a6gtv6h94fdv4egkev&st=d1j39d92&dl=0. He closed with his contact information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nIn each email, the sender included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard confidentiality notice, and similarly, the Hensley & Ross messages included their confidentiality language. The communications collectively show that a Motion to Compel was filed on October 10, 2024, with a motion hour scheduled for October 21, 2024; Plaintiff\u2019s Confidential Settlement Demand was provided; and the motion hour date was subsequently moved to November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m. The latest included document, Plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Remand, was attached to the October 14, 2024 email from Bryce Koon.",

      "natural_language": "This matter concerns Debra Marshall in a motor vehicle collision case against Jasmine Reed in the Barren Circuit Court, captioned Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed (case number 23-CI-00659). The client is Debra Marshall, and the file name for the matter is Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022, reflecting the December 3, 2022 motor vehicle accident.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, at 9:46 a.m. Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel at Hensley & Ross, to Sarena Tuttle, and to the Debra Marshall MVA 12/3/2022 Filevine project email address. The message stated, \u201cGood morning counsel, Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. Attached please find Plaintiff's Notice of Remand.\u201d It included the sender\u2019s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email carried the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, noting the communication was intended only for the named recipient, and instructing what to do if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier communications from October 10, 2024, are part of the same thread. At 5:24 p.m., Hensley & Ross replied, apologizing for an oversight: they had the signed interrogatories in the file but had failed to file them; they stated they would file them in the morning. The reply was sent by Pat of Hensley & Ross, with the firm\u2019s address at 207 E. Main St., Horse Cave, KY 42749, and contact details (phone 270-786-2155, fax 270-786-2118).\n\nAlso on October 10, 2024, at 2:48 p.m., Bryce Koon responded to Hensley & Ross, informing them that he had been advised the motion hour date would be moved to November 4, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.\n\nEarlier yet, on October 10, 2024, at 1:44 p.m., Bryce Koon sent another message attaching a Motion to Compel that had been filed that day. He noted the motion was set for motion hour on Monday, October 21, 2024, and he stated that if opposing counsel provided discovery responses before that date, they would remand the motion. He also attached Plaintiff's Confidential Settlement Demand and provided a Dropbox link to related documents: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/sc5yapd7wxz1zqjpvrlot/ABJjIzaAnDXFHO1REH3gx94?rlkey=9tr5vm3a6gtv6h94fdv4egkev&st=d1j39d92&dl=0. The email again included the standard privilege disclaimer regarding attorney-client communications.\n\nTogether, these messages comprise the communications and attachments in this matter as of October 14, 2024, including the Plaintiff\u2019s Notice of Remand, a Motion to Compel with a related Confidential Settlement Demand, a scheduled motion hour, and updates to discovery filings and deadlines along with the corresponding privilege notices.",

On December 20, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, sent an email to Hensley & Ross indicating that, after a quick review of the file, the firm was ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed. The message asked for dates when Mrs. Reed and Hensley & Ross are available to proceed with depositions via Zoom, and it stated that the firm was open to discussing settlement if the opposing side preferred an offer in lieu of providing deposition dates. The email concluded with holiday wishes and provided Tuttle\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone numbers (D) 502-357-9971 and (O) 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting a new email address.\n\nFollowing that, on January 13, 2025, at 12:34 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Hensley & Ross (to which she had copied Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon) noting that on December 20, 2024 they had reached out for deposition dates and that they were approaching about 30 days without a response. She requested dates on which Mrs. Reed and Hensley & Ross are available to move forward with depositions and reiterated a willingness to discuss settlement if the other side preferred to make an offer in lieu of scheduling depositions. Her signature again listed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and contact details, including the reminder to use the new email address.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, December 20, 2024 at approximately 3:00 PM (the record shows 3:00? PM), Sarena Tuttle had written to Mr. Ross informing him that, after a quick review of the file, the firm was ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed and asking for dates when Mrs. Reed and his office would be available via Zoom. She invited any questions and closed with holiday wishes, signing as before with the firm\u2019s contact information and noting the new email address.\n\nOn January 13, 2025, at about 2:33 PM (2:33? PM in the record), Pat of Hensley & Ross wrote back, indicating that they would need to check with their client but proposing February 17, 19, 20, or 21 as potential dates for the deposition.\n\nFinally, on January 13, 2025, at 2:40:08 PM -0500, Sarena Tuttle responded: of the proposed dates, only February 20 works for their side, and she noted that they have a fairly open schedule for March if that would be helpful. The thread preserves the parties\u2019 positions and the continued attempt to coordinate Mrs. Reed\u2019s deposition by Zoom, with the option of settlement discussions and the ongoing exchange of dates.",

The structured note records communications between the two firms handling the case: Hensley & Ross (Pat Hensley, one of the attorneys) and The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager). The deposition in question concerns Jasmine Reed, with depositions being scheduled via Zoom.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Mr. Ross at Hensley & Ross stating, after a quick review of the file, that they were ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed and requesting dates when Mrs. Reed and Mr. Ross\u2019s office would be available to participate via Zoom. The email emphasized the need to move forward with the deposition and closed with \u201cHappy Holidays.\u201d The message was sent by Sarena M. Tuttle, whose contact details at that time included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (502) 357-9971, main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nIn the ensuing communications on January 13, 2025, the Whaley firm followed up about scheduling. At 12:34 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote Good afternoon Mr. Ross, noting that on December 20, 2024 they had reached out for dates to depose Mrs. Reed and that they were approaching 30 days without a response. She asked that dates for Mrs. Reed and his office to move forward with depositions be provided, and she stated they were open to discussing settlement if an offer was made in lieu of providing deposition dates. She reiterated their willingness to move forward and to avoid further delays.\n\nLater that same day, at 1:40 PM, Sarena replied again, informing Mr. Ross that of the dates previously discussed, only February 20th works for them, and that they have a pretty open schedule for March if that would help. Pat Hensley then responded the same day at 2:33 PM with: \u201cI will have to check with my client but How about February 17, 19, 20, or 21?\u201d This inquiry was followed by a reply from Hensley & Ross at 3:02 PM: \u201cThanks, let me confirm with my client.\u201d\n\nAt 2:21 PM on January 13, 2025, Sarena sent another brief reply: \u201cSounds good, thank you.\u201d Finally, in the ongoing thread that same day, Pat Hensley noted that his client was available on Mondays due to a scheduling constraint related to Debra Marshall\u2019s start in nursing school, and he proposed two Monday dates, March 3 or March 10, as possible deposition dates. This reflects Debra Marshall\u2019s availability being limited to Mondays during her nursing school start.\n\nFor comfort and context, the record also includes the sending and receiving offices\u2019 full contact details. Hensley & Ross is listed as Attor-neys at Law with a street address of 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749, and contact numbers (270) 786-2155 and fax (270) 786-2118. The Whaley Law Firm is listed with the Louisville address of 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the contact numbers D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, with the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nOverall, the deposition scheduling efforts centered on obtaining dates for Dr. Reed\u2019s deposition via Zoom, with February 20 being workable for the Whaley firm, a potential open window in March, and the countervailing constraint that Debra Marshall would be available only on Mondays due to nursing school, prompting Pat Hensley to propose Monday dates in March (specifically March 3 or March 10). The exchange also touched on the possibility of settlement in lieu of depositions if a settlement offer could be made. The parties\u2019 communications spanned December 20, 2024 through January 13, 2025, with repeated back-and-forth on preferred dates and ongoing confirmation efforts.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. Client: Debra Marshall. This narrative covers the communications regarding scheduling the deposition in Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed, Barren County Circuit Court 23-CI-00659, with the deposition of Mrs. Reed to be conducted by Zoom.\n\nBeginning with December 20, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm, through Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, informed Hensley & Ross that they were ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed. In that message, Sarena asked Pat Hensley of Hensley & Ross to provide dates when Mrs. Reed and their office were available for a Zoom deposition, and she wished to move forward with scheduling. She also noted the holiday season and signed the message with her firm\u2019s contact details and her new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, indicating the address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: 502-357-9971 and O: 502-583-4022 ext 104.\n\nOn January 13, 2025, Hensley & Ross replied that their client was starting nursing school and was available only on Mondays, asking whether March 3 or March 10 would work. Sarena responded later that day, indicating that of the proposed dates, only February 20 would work for them, though they had a fairly open schedule for March if that could help. She again signed with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and her new email address. Pat Hensley from Hensley & Ross then replied that he would have to check with his client, asking for confirmation.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarena sent another message confirming that the February 20 date would work for them and noting a relatively open March schedule if helpful. A subsequent message from Hensley & Ross suggested February 17, 19, 20, or 21 as possible dates, to which Sarena replied that she would need to confirm with her client. The exchange also included the CC of Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon in the December 20, 2024 thread and again reflected in the January 13, 2025 correspondence.\n\nAt 4:46 PM on January 13, 2025, Hensley & Ross wrote that their client was starting nursing school and was only available on Mondays, asking whether March 3 or March 10 would be workable. In response, on January 15, 2025 at 10:15 AM, Sarena acknowledged the dates, explaining that Mondays are difficult because of Jefferson County Motion Hour every Monday, but given the timeline, they should be able to make March 3, 2025 work. She proposed a start time of 1:00 PM EST and asked Pat to confirm if that time would be acceptable.\n\nIn summary, the parties were coordinating the deposition of Mrs. Reed in the Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed matter, aiming to hold a Zoom deposition. The discussions spanned late December 2024 through mid-January 2025, with consideration given to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s scheduling constraints (notably Mondays due to the client\u2019s UNavailability and the attorney\u2019s weekly schedule) and the goal of setting a deposition date for late February or early March 2025. The proposed resolution at the end of the chain was March 3, 2025, at 1:00 PM EST, pending confirmation. The communications consistently identified Debra Marshall as the client and Jasmine Reed as the deponent in the Barren County Circuit Court case 23-CI-00659, with the deposition to be conducted by Zoom.\n\nContact details present in the thread included:\n- The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address). \n- The Opposing counsel, Hensley & Ross: 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749; (270) 786-2155; fax (270) 786-2118. \n- The CC\u2019d contacts in the December 20, 2024 thread included Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed, Barren County Circuit Court, 23-CI-00659. The client is Debra Marshall, and the file is titled Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed, with the matter listed as a motor vehicle accident case (Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022). The deposition of Jasmine Reed was being scheduled via Zoom, with correspondence between Hensley & Ross (Pat) and The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle).\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Pat Hensley of Hensley & Ross. She stated that, after a quick review of the file, they were ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed and asked for dates that Mrs. Reed and the firm were available to appear via Zoom, inviting any questions and extending holiday wishes.\n\nOn January 13, 2025, Sarena followed up again, noting that they had reached out on December 20, 2024 and were approaching 30 days without a response. She requested that the office provide dates when Mrs. Reed and they could move forward with depositions and also indicated openness to discuss settlement if an offer had been made in lieu of depositions, expressing a desire to avoid further delays.\n\nPat replied later on January 13, 2025, stating that he would need to check with his client but proposing February 17, 19, 20, or 21 as potential deposition dates.\n\nAlso on January 13, 2025, Sarena responded that of those proposed February dates, only February 20 would work for them, and that they had a fairly open schedule for March if that would help. A few minutes later, Sarena sent another short note: \u201cSounds good, thank you.\u201d\n\nPat then noted on January 13, 2025, at 4:46 PM that his client was starting nursing school and was only available on Mondays, proposing March 3 or March 10 as alternatives.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, Sarena sent another message explaining that Mondays are a little difficult because of Jefferson County Motion Hour every Monday; however, given the dates are relatively far out, they should be able to make March 3, 2025 work and asked whether a 1:00 PM EST start time would be acceptable.\n\nPat responded on January 15, 2025, at 9:45 AM with a new question: How about 1:30 PM? He also asked whether the deposition would be conducted remotely and whether Debra Marshall would be available.\n\nContact details relevant to the matter include:\n- Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law, 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749; phone (270) 786-2155; fax (270) 786-2118.\n- The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 357-9971; main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (note: new email address).\n\nIn summary, the deposition of Jasmine Reed was being scheduled with a target timeframe in March 2025, with February 20 identified as the only February date workable for The Whaley Law Firm, and March 3 or 10 proposed by Pat due to his client\u2019s Monday-only availability. The latest correspondence indicates a consideration of a 1:00 PM EST start for March 3, 2025, with ongoing questions about a remote deposition format and client availability, and a request to confirm whether a 1:30 PM start could be accommodated.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022. Client: Debra Marshall. The matter is Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed in the Barren County Circuit Court, docket 23-CI-00659, arising from a motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022. The following narrative summarizes the email exchanges between The Whaley Law Firm and Hensley & Ross from December 20, 2024 through January 15, 2025, regarding scheduling depositions of Jasmine Reed and Debra Marshall by Zoom, with times and availability discussed by the parties.\n\nBeginning with December 20, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager) reached out to Pat Hensley of Hensley & Ross to set depositions for Mrs. Reed and to coordinate dates and times via Zoom. In a December 20, 2024 message, Sarena noted that in December 2024 they had previously contacted Hensley & Ross about deposition dates for Mrs. Reed and, after nearly 30 days without a response, urged the office to provide available dates for Mrs. Reed and their client to move forward, mentioning they were open to discussion of settlement if an offer was on the table. The emails from that date also included Sarena\u2019s invitation to proceed with depositions and to communicate any questions, with CCs to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon. A follow-up note later that same day stated that they were ready to schedule Mrs. Reed\u2019s deposition and requested dates that Mrs. Reed and the defense office were available via Zoom, closing with holiday wishes.\n\nMoving into January 2025, the parties continued to negotiate dates. On January 13, 2025, Hensley & Ross proposed that their client could be available on February 17, 19, 20, or 21, noting that their client\u2019s schedule needed checking. In response, Sarena acknowledged those options and stated that, of those dates, February 20 would work for them, while also noting that they had a fairly open March schedule if needed. Pat Hensley replied that he would need to confer with his client, and Sarena followed up with a message indicating that February 20 was acceptable for them and again highlighting a flexible March schedule if necessary. In that exchange, Hensley & Ross also explained that their client\u2019s availability was constrained by a Monday-only schedule because she was starting nursing school and was unavailable on other days; Pat proposed March 3 or March 10 as alternatives.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, the thread progressed to more concrete timing. Sarena reaffirmed that February 20 remained the viable date, with the possibility of a March schedule if needed. Pat then asked whether the depositions could be conducted remotely and whether their client would be available. Sarena confirmed that a 1:30 p.m. start time would be suitable and indicated that Zoom would be an appropriate format. She added that Debra Marshall could be available that morning and asked whether they should begin Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition at 10:00 a.m. EST.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the parties consistently discussed Zoom as the method for depositions, the availability of Jasmine Reed and Debra Marshall, and the impact of the defendants\u2019 and plaintiffs\u2019 schedules, including Monday-only constraints related to the defense client\u2019s nursing studies and local court timing (notably Jefferson County Motion Hour on Mondays). The communications reflect ongoing efforts to finalize dates and times for the depositions of Jasmine Reed and Debra Marshall, with February 20 identified as workable for the Reed deposition and the potential for a March schedule if needed, alongside a proposed 1:30 p.m. time for one deposition and a 10:00 a.m. start for Debra Marshall on the same day.",

Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm (contactable at Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext. 104), emailed Pat Ross of Hensley & Ross (to hrh@scrtc.com) requesting dates on which Jasmine Reed and the firm could depose Mrs. Reed via Zoom. She noted that the Whaley firm had previously reached out about deposition dates and had not received a response for nearly 30 days. She stated the office was ready to schedule and open to discussing settlement offers if the opposing side wished to make one. She asked that the offices provide dates for the depositions and indicated that if there were questions they could contact her to discuss further.\n\nOver the following weeks, the parties exchanged several messages. Pat Ross suggested possible dates of February 17, 19, 20, or 21, noting his client\u2019s availability constraints. Sarena responded that February 20 would work for them and that they had a fairly open schedule for March if that helped. The ongoing dialogue also revealed that Mrs. Reed\u2019s counsel indicated Monday availability constraints due to the attorney\u2019s schedule (the client was starting nursing school and would be available only on Mondays), leading to consideration of March 3 or March 10 as possible dates. Hensley & Ross reiterated their Monday-only constraint and proposed those March dates.\n\nThroughout January 2025, Sarena and Pat continued to discuss preferred start times. At one point Sarena asked whether a 1:00 p.m. EST start would be acceptable, and later conversations anchored on a 1:30 p.m. start for the deposition of Jasmine Reed, with Zoom identified as the method. There were additional exchanges confirming that Jasmine Reed\u2019s deposition would be conducted remotely and that Debra Marshall would also be deposed by Zoom. In a January 15, 2025 exchange, Hensley & Ross asked if Reed\u2019s 1:30 p.m. start would work and whether the deposition could be conducted remotely, also inquiring about Debra Marshall\u2019s availability.\n\nOn January 15, 2025, Sarena raised the possibility of a 1:00 p.m. EST start and noted the option of a 1:30 p.m. start, with Zoom as the preferred platform. By January 15, 2025 at 11:04 a.m., the parties appeared to converge on a plan: a 1:30 p.m. start for Jasmine Reed via Zoom, with Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition also to be conducted via Zoom, and with Debra Marshall available that morning if a 10:00 a.m. EST start for her deposition was workable for the other side.\n\nFinally, on January 17, 2025 at 1:16 p.m. (Eastern Time), Sarena Tuttle followed up to finalize the scheduling. The recap stated that, on March 3, 2025, Jasmine Reed would be deposed at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom, and that the Plaintiff\u2019s deposition would also be conducted via Zoom at a time to be confirmed. She asked what start time would work best for beginning Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition.\n\nThe latest scheduling communications also include contact details for Sarena Tuttle, who has a new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), and reiterate the firm\u2019s Louisville office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s phone numbers are listed as D: 502-357-9971 and O: 502-583-4022 ext. 104, and the firm\u2019s email is provided for further coordination.\n\nIn summary, the deposition schedule as of the latest communications is set for March 3, 2025, with Jasmine Reed\u2019s deposition at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom, and Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition to be conducted via Zoom in the morning, with an exact start time to be confirmed. The parties remain aligned on Zoom as the deposition method and are awaiting final confirmation of the Plaintiff\u2019s start time.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the scheduling communications between The Whaley Law Firm (representing the plaintiff, Debra Marshall) and Hensley & Ross (representing the defendant, Jasmine Reed) in Debra Marshall v. Jasmine Reed, Barren County Circuit Court, Case 23-CI-00659. The case caption shows Debra Marshall as the plaintiff with a motor vehicle accident date of December 3, 2022 (Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022). The depositions under discussion were to be conducted by Zoom, with the defendant\u2019s deposition of Jasmine Reed set for March 3, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. and the plaintiff Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition to be scheduled for an earlier time on the same day.\n\nThe exchange began with an email on December 20, 2024, from Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address) to Pat Hensley of Hensley & Ross (207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749; (270) 786-2155; fax 270-786-2118). Tuttle stated that they had previously reached out and were awaiting dates for deposing Mrs. Reed, proposing that the depositions be conducted via Zoom and that they were open to settlement if the other side wished to make an offer instead of providing deposition dates. In addition, she noted that they were looking to avoid further delays and invited discussion on settlement if appropriate.\n\nOn January 13, 2025, Tuttle responded to Hensley & Ross, noting that from the dates previously discussed, only February 20, 2025 worked for The Whaley Law Firm, with a March schedule that could be fairly open if needed. Hensley & Ross replied later that day, offering February 17, 19, 20, or 21 as alternatives and indicating they would need to check with their client. Tuttle then stated that of those dates, February 20 works for them, reiterating the possibility of a open March schedule if needed. Hensley & Ross followed up, saying they would confirm with their client. The firm then added that their client (Debra Marshall) is starting nursing school and is only available on Mondays, proposing March 3 or March 10 as options. \n\nOn January 15, 2025, Tuttle indicated that a 1:30 p.m. start time was acceptable for Reed and suggested that Zoom would be a good format for this matter. She also asked whether Debra Marshall could be available that morning and whether they should start her deposition at 10:00 a.m. EST. Hensley & Ross asked for confirmation that the 1:30 p.m. time would work and whether the deposition would be conducted remotely, inquiring about the availability of their client on that schedule. Tuttle reaffirmed that 1:30 p.m. would work, that Zoom was suitable, and that Debra Marshall would be available that morning with an intended 10:00 a.m. start for her deposition, noting that the March 3, 2025 date would accommodate Reed\u2019s 1:30 p.m. deposition via Zoom and that the plaintiff\u2019s start time remained to be confirmed. \n\nOn January 17, 2025, Hensley & Ross proposed finalizing the plaintiff\u2019s start time at 10:30 a.m. EST, while keeping Jasmine Reed\u2019s deposition for March 3, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom. Sarena Tuttle then replied to confirm the March 3, 2025 schedule with Reed at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom and to request the plaintiff\u2019s start time, noting that both depositions would be conducted via Zoom. The thread closes with Hensley & Ross confirming the 10:30 a.m. EST start for the plaintiff\u2019s deposition and the 1:30 p.m. start for Reed on March 3, 2025.\n\nThroughout these emails, the parties reference the following contact details and signatures:\n\n- Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law\n  207 E. Main St.\n  P.O. Box 350\n  Horse Cave, KY 42749\n  (270) 786-2155\n  fax (270) 786-2118\n  The sender\u2019s closing references Pat (P. Hensley) and the firm\u2019s address were consistently included in the messages.\n\n- The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager\n  712 Lyndon Lane\n  Louisville, KY 40222\n  D: (502) 357-9971\n  O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104\n  E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\n  Note in Tuttle\u2019s signature: \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS\u201d\n\n- In the email chain, the subject line consistently references Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed - Barren Co. Circuit Court 23-CI-00659, with Debra Marshall listed as the client for the case caption.\n\nIn summary, after an initial outreach in December 2024 seeking deposition dates and a lack of timely response, the parties engaged in a back-and-forth through January 2025 to align on dates. Debra Marshall\u2019s deposition was ultimately scheduled for March 3, 2025 at 10:30 a.m. EST, with Jasmine Reed\u2019s deposition set for March 3, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom, both sessions to be conducted remotely. The proceedings were positioned as Zoom depositions, with ongoing coordination between The Whaley Law Firm and Hensley & Ross to confirm the plaintiff\u2019s start time on that date.",

      "natural_language": "In the Debra Marshall v Jasmine Reed matter, Barren County Circuit Court case number 23-CI-00659 (the file also references Debra Marshall\u2019s motor vehicle accident on December 3, 2022, labeled Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022), The Whaley Law Firm prepared and sent a Notice to Take Deposition of Jasmine Reed. The notice was filed via CourtNet and carried envelope number 9684744. The transmission came from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct dial 502-357-9971 and main office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104. Her email address noted on the message was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (marked as the new email address). The recipient was Hensley & Ross, Attorneys at Law, at 207 E. Main St., P.O. Box 350, Horse Cave, KY 42749, with the firm\u2019s phone number 270-786-2155 and fax 270-786-2118.\n\nThe scheduling of depositions progressed through a lengthy email chain beginning in December 2024. On December 20, 2024, Sarena Tuttle stated that, after a quick review of the file, the parties were ready to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Reed and asked for dates when Jasmine Reed and Hensley & Ross could participate via Zoom, inviting any questions and even offering settlement discussions if an offer was being considered to move the matter forward. In the subsequent exchanges on January 13, 2025, Sarena reminded that on December 20, 2024 she had reached out for deposition dates and noted that the matter was approaching 30 days without a response; she requested dates for depositions via Zoom and indicated openness to settlement discussions if appropriate. Pat Hensley of Hensley & Ross replied that he would need to check with his client and proposed dates of February 17, 19, 20, or 21. Sarena acknowledged, and Pat added that his client would be available Mondays, explaining that the defendant\u2019s schedule was constrained by his client\u2019s nursing school.\n\nThe conversation continued with further back-and-forth in mid-January 2025. On January 13, 2025, Sarena confirmed that the February dates would need to be weighed and indicated that the March dates might be workable. Pat responded that his client would be available on Mondays for scheduling, proposing March 3 or March 10 as possibilities. Sarena then suggested that 1:30 p.m. could work and asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start for Debra Marshall would be feasible, noting that Zoom would be used for the depositions. Pat asked whether the proceedings would be remote and whether Debra Marshall would be available. Sarena replied affirmatively to the remote format and the 1:30 p.m. time, and suggested starting Mrs. Marshall at 10:00 a.m. EST. The parties continued to discuss the plan, with the understanding that the March 3 date remained a viable option.\n\nBy January 17, 2025, the scheduling had crystallized further: the plan was for March 3, 2025, with Jasmine Reed\u2019s deposition at 1:30 p.m. via Zoom, and the plaintiff\u2019s deposition to be held via Zoom as well with a start time to be confirmed. At roughly the same time, Hensley & Ross suggested a start time of 10:30 a.m. for the plaintiff\u2019s deposition, and Sarena indicated she would send the notice shortly. Later that day, Sarena confirmed the plan and issued the deposition notice: \u201cHere is our Notice to Take Deposition of Jasmine Reed, filed via CourtNet Envelope 9684744 moments ago,\u201d accompanied by the sender\u2019s details and the reminder to use the new email address. The notice was sent to Hensley & Ross, with the expectation that the depositions would proceed by Zoom on March 3, 2025, Reed at 1:30 p.m. and the plaintiff at 10:30 a.m., both to be conducted remotely. The communications also recorded that the notice was filed via CourtNet and included the exchange history and the participants\u2019 contact information, including Sarena\u2019s updated email address.",
