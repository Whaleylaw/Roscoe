      "natural_language": "Case: Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024. Client: Nayram Adadevoh.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, a two-page fax was sent to the client’s fax number +18475189718. A forward from Jessa Galosmo at Whaley Law Firm to Nayram Adadevoh’s Filevine project email address indicated that the fax had been received at 2024/12/03 08:51:50 with the subject line: “FW: NEW FAX: A fax of 2 pages has been received on your fax number: +18475189718 from on 2024/12/03 08:51:50. ‘send unencrypted’.” The forwarded message itself was dated Tue Dec 3, 2024 11:46:53 GMT-05:00.\n\nThe original notification chain shows that Concord Fax delivered a system message to Subro-SharedFax at 8:53 AM on Tuesday, December 3, 2024, with the subject: “NEW FAX: A fax of 2 pages has been received on your fax number: +18475189718 from on 2024/12/03 08:51:50.” The Concord Fax message included an external-email warning and noted that a fax of 2 pages had been received at the Concord Fax Online fax number (+18475189718) at 2024/12/03 08:51:50 and had been attached to the email. The tracking number assigned was ct18475189718-20241203065150677-244-25. The message listed Received from (CSID) as blank and Received from (Caller ID) as 15023579939, with 2 pages total and the time received recorded as 2024/12/03 08:51:50. Instructions for checking status were provided via https://portal.concordfax.com, and the message concluded with a confidentiality notice regarding Protected Health Information and a reminder to notify the sender at 847-518-9800 if the message was received in error.

      "natural_language": "Case: Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024. Client: Nayram Adadevoh.\n\nThis note documents a small thread of communications concerning the matter Abby Sitgraves, et al. v. Caal Worldwide, et al. The email chain shows the following sequence of events and participants.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, Michelle Singleton, a Legal Assistant at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, sent counsel a message with a link to Caal Worldwide’s answers to discovery in the Abby Sitgraves matter. In that email, she explained that the link would expire in 10 days and invited recipients to contact her with any questions. The message included the courtesy signature for Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, with the firm’s address at 614 West Main Street, Suite 3000, Louisville, KY 40202, telephone number 502-584-1600, and fax 502-584-9971, along with the confidentiality notice typical of privileged communications. The subject of that email was Abby Sitgraves, et al. v. Caal Worldwide, et al., and the message contained a placeholder image indicating a folder labeled “Caal Worldwide.”\n\nLater the same day, Sam Leffert, an Associate at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, sent a reply noting: “Aaron and Bryce – Do you have an update on Plaintiffs’ responses to our discovery requests?” He included his own contact information, including the firm’s Louisville address (614 West Main Street, Suite 3000), office phone 502-584-1600, fax 502-584-9971, and email sleffert@bdblawky.com, along with the firm’s website. This email also carried the standard confidentiality notice stating that the message contains confidential information that may be legally privileged and advising recipients who are not the intended recipients to notify the sender and delete the message. The email signature blocks contained the full contact information for Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC.\n\nEarlier that day, Michelle Singleton had also forwarded a separate email to counsel with the subject Abby Sitgraves, et al. v. Caal Worldwide, et al. In this message, Singleton reiterated the instruction to use the provided link to access Caal Worldwide’s discovery responses and again noted that the link would expire in 10 days. The message was signed by Michelle Singleton as Legal Assistant for Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, with the same firm address and contact details as above, and it carried the same confidentiality disclaimer about privileged information and proper handling if received in error.\n\nFinally, on March 28, 2025, at 12:45:44 PM Eastern Time, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent a follow-up to Sam Leffert and Michelle Singleton, with Bryce copied on the email and additional recipients included in the CC line: Bryce Cotton; dharvey@carlisle-law.com; Sarena Tuttle; Abby Sitgraves’s Filevine project email address (AbbySitgravesMVAZ4665577@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com); and Nayram Adadevoh’s Filevine project email address (NayramAdadevohMVAZ4669798@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). In his note, Bryce stated that he would have the responses over to the recipients in the coming days and thanked them for their patience. He then referenced the discovery responses from the opposing side, noting that they indicated attached photographs of the vehicle in question, but those photographs did not appear on the provided link. He asked whether there are photographs of the vehicle and requested identification of whether the vehicle is still available for inspection. Bryce signed his message as “W. Bryce Koon, Esq.” of The Whaley Law Firm, including his Louisville address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. The closing also included the standard confidentiality disclaimer applicable to the electronic communication.\n\nIn sum, the thread shows ongoing discovery activity in the Abby Sitgraves v. Caal Worldwide matter, with the opposing side’s discovery responses circulated via a link (which reportedly expires in 10 days), requests for any photographs of the involved vehicle and a determination of whether the vehicle remains available for inspection, and a request for update on plaintiffs’ responses. The case caption and client at the top of the note indicate it is filed under Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024 for client Nayram Adadevoh, with the Filevine project email addresses of Abby Sitgraves and Nayram Adadevoh listed in the communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024\nClient: Nayram Adadevoh\n\nThis set of communications concerns Nayram Adadevoh (ID No.: CDA000124841) and the Chicago Public Schools Benefit Plan subrogation matter BE-123507, within the Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024 file. The exchanges occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Coghlan Law LLC from March 31 through April 3, 2025, with Nayram Adadevoh cc’d via the Filevine project address.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, at 1:42 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to 3123570961@rcfax.com and to Gregory J. Simon (gjs@ckc-law.com), with Nayram Adadevoh’s Filevine project email address cc’d. The message stated: “Good afternoon, Please see the attached letter of representation.” The email included a standard privilege and confidentiality notice.\n\nLater that day, at approximately 5:02 PM, Gregory J. Simon responded: “Attorney Koon, Thank you for your letter. Attached is our letter regarding the captioned subrogation claim by the Chicago Public Schools Benefit Plan on behalf of Nayram Adadevoh. Please call if you have any questions.” This message likewise carried the privilege and confidentiality notice.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, Bryce Koon again engaged the matter, and on April 3, 2025, at 2:30 PM he wrote to Gregory J. Simon (and copied the same recipients) inquiring: “Counsel, I have received your letter and ledger. Is there any chance you have any records and/or bills associated with the 07/29/24 payment to Advocate Medical Group?” He signed with The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details.\n\nIn response, on April 3, 2025, at 3:37 PM, Gregory J. Simon wrote: “We have requested a copy of the Advocate bill for that date of service from BlueCross BlueShield and should receive it in a few days. We will forward the bill copy to you as soon as we receive it. Unfortunately, we do not have any medical records for Mr. Adadevoh.” The standard confidentiality notice accompanied this email as well.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 3:37 PM, Bryce Koon replied: “No worries at all. Thank you for your help.” This follow-up continued the thread, which, like the others, included the privilege and confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns Nayram Adadevoh as the client in Nayram-Adadevoh-MVA-7-13-2024, relating to Adadevoh, et al. v. CAAL Worldwide, et al. (Jefferson 25-CI-00133). The communication thread centers on a discovery dispute in that matter and involves counsel from two Louisville firms: W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, representing Nayram Adadevoh, and Bryce L. Cotton, a partner and legal counsel at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, representing the opposing side. The May 9, 2025 exchanges were copied to Sam Leffert, as well as two filevineapp.com email addresses: AbbySitgravesMVAZ4665577@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and NayramAdadevohMVAZ4669798@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The subject line of the chain is the case caption “Re: Adadevoh, et al. v. CAAL Worldwide, et al. (Jefferson 25-CI-00133).”\n\nEarlier in the afternoon, at approximately 2:43 PM on May 9, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a message to counsel with the subject apparently tied to the attached correspondence. In that email, he wrote only, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see the attached correspondence.” He included his standard firm signature for The Whaley Law Firm with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and his contact details: phone (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207. The body of the message was accompanied by a warning that the email was external and contained a file attachment, directing recipients to treat it accordingly and to contact The Whaley Law Firm’s Office Administrator if the message had been received in error. The attachment referenced in the header was indicated as “LT DC re CAAL Discovery.pdf.”\n\nLater that same day, at about 3:03 PM, Bryce Cotton of Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, replied to the thread. His message questioned the contemporaneous conduct in the dispute, asking, “Are you seriously threatening to seek fees on a simple discovery dispute after ignoring our emails for weeks? What an absolute joke…,” indicating frustration with the pace of communication. Cotton’s message included his full professional signature, identifying him as Legal Counsel and Partner at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, with offices at 614 West Main Street, Suite 3000, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. He provided office, direct dial, and fax numbers (Office: 502.584.1600, Direct: 502.371.0589, Fax: 502.584.9971) and his email address bcotton@bdblawky.com, along with the firm’s website. He also attached the standard confidentiality notice common to legal communications, warning that the message and any attachments are confidential and legally privileged, and that recipients not intended to receive the email should not review, retransmit, copy, or disseminate it, and should notify the sender and delete the message if received in error. The notice also cautioned that if the message contains a forwarded or replied-to item, some or all contents may not have been produced by Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC.\n\nIn the same thread, the exchange included the Whaley Law Firm’s reply at about 3:05 PM on May 9, 2025. Bryce Koon responded simply, “I will await your response,” and closed with his signature block for The Whaley Law Firm, including the firm’s address, phone, and fax. His closing line appeared after the prior exchange, and the thread continued to include the customary attorney-client privileged notices that accompany these communications.\n\nThe chain also shows the CC recipients listed in the initial message and the continuation of the discussion among opposing counsel and file-based recipients. The May 9, 2025 emails reference an attached document and include the typical external-email cautionary language, with the file name LT DC re CAAL Discovery.pdf noted in the caution line and an attached document path referenced in the header of the 2:43 PM message. The entire correspondence reflects a dispute over discovery in the Adadevoh v. CAAL Worldwide matter, with the parties’ counsel exchanging messages, attachments, and protective notices on that date.",
