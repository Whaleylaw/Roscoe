I hope you are doing well. Hey, the\nreason I am calling. So 3 weeks ago, I had a blood clot/heart attack. Long\nstory short, my cardiologist and the gastro neurologist were not\ncommunicating. And instead of being on a blood thinner during this time and\nthen being on A med that is appropriate for the procedures that the gastro\nwas going to do. They basically took me off of everything, which in turn\ncaused a clot which nearly killed me and messed up the bottom half of my\nheart. This is an ongoing problem with the office they do not communicate\nthe dr. or the cardiologist is a personal friend. But again, his office\nstaff has made a major mistake and I am going to pay the price for it in\nyears left in my life. ...\"\nListen to this message over your phone or log in to your RingCentral account\n with your main number, extension number,\nand password.

Explained where we are with dog bite and necessity of filing - he understood. He is going to send us over some notes and information from his therapist about recent troubles with dogs and PTSD. \n\nAlso talked to him about his heart. Its a much trickier situation, but from my understanding it goes like this:\n- Client had aortic valve replacement in 2010 and has mechanical value - has been taking blood thinners since (Warfarin)\n- Client's gastro told him to stop taking blood thinners because of colonoscopy\n- Gastro did not communicate with Cardio doctor about taking off blood thinners\n- About two weeks later, client gets a clot and has a heart attack\n- Doctor put in stent and told him that it was because he was off heart meds\n- Client doesn't think doctors actually signed off on him going off blood thinners\n- Now has to go through months of cardio rehab and has heart damage (decreased ejection fraction of left ventricle - shown by echo)\n\nI told him I would request the records from the doctors and try to look into in. In the meantime I am going to be filing his suit. \n__Person Making Contact:__ Bryce\n__Date & Time__: September 26 2024",

Bryce filed your Premise Liability (Dog Bite) Complaint on September 27, 2024 in the Jefferson County Circuit Court. At this time, we have to await service of the Defendant. Once the Defendant is served, we will move into a 'Discovery' phase, which we will discuss in further detail once we move into that phase. In the meantime, there is nothing further for you to do at this time. As far as your case regarding the issue between your physicians, Bryce is reviewing that claim and should be reaching out to discuss that with you in further detail. I do know I have a list of medical records he has asked me to request related to that claim, if we need additional information on that claim, Bryce will reach out to you. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail. \n__Person Making Contact:__ Sarena\n__Date & Time__: October 07 2024",

Is that Temple, TX 76502? As far as your questions, the Defendant will not have access to this information, only his attorney. Tax Info is requested when there are lost wages or a diminished capacity to labor and/or earn. We will likely object to this request and not provide the authorization, however, that is up to the attorneys to formally decide. In regard to the medical records, the Defense has the right to verify to information provided by requesting their own copy of the records so they can maintain their own chain of evidence. Also, they would be looking for any pre-existing conditions to minimize the damages sought. We understand that neither of these situations fit your specific case, however, Discovery is a standardized phase of litigation and certain information is requested as a 'standard practice'. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly at (502) 583-4022 Ext 104 or Bryce at Ext 114. -Sarena, The Whaley Law Firm \n__Person Making Contact:__ Sarena\n__Date & Time__: October 23 2024",

(See details)\nA potential red flag is that the plaintiff's team missed the initial deadline for discovery responses, which were due on October 22, 2024. This led to a warning from opposing counsel about a potential motion to compel. (See details), (See details)\nThe next step should be to ensure all defendants have been properly served and to monitor for any responses to the recently submitted discovery. Additionally, the team should gather any available photographic evidence of injuries, as none were found in the current records. (See details)",

Please update the email address you have on\nfile, it appears you sent this to an old email that honestly should be\nclosed at this point. However, Bryce has spoken with the Defense for the\nProperty Owner, 432 Atwood LLC and we are awaiting their responses to our\nDiscovery Requests. Currently, they have until April 19th to respond.\nUnfortunately, we still have not received an Answer to Complaint from Mr.\nBrown and/or Mrs. Burden, though they have been served. We will continue to\nmove forward into litigation with Defendant 432 Atwood and will consider\nDefault Judgements on the Brown & Burden at a later date. If we sought the\nDefault Judgement on them now, it could hinder our claims against 432\nAtwood LLC. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\nSarena M.
