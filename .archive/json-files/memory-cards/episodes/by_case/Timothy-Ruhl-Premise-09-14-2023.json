Maureen's Sister, who lives in\nIllinois, is the Administrator of the Estate and is refusing to provide\nMaureen with any updates as to what is going on with the Estate.\nApparently, there was a Trust set up before Mom's passing and the Sister is\nrefusing to provide Maureen any information related to the Trust. She is\nrequesting a letter to the Trustee requesting copies of the\ndocuments associated with the Trust.\n Could one of you please call & discuss with the Client's Wife? I\nhave advised him, Tim, that with the estate being in Florida, I would not\nhave the best knowledge of Florida Probate and what they will require.\nAlso, advised with the Sister being in IL, she may be administrating under\nIL Law instead of Florida and that is best answered by one of you or you\ncould possibly refer them to someone.\nSarena M.

Unfortunately, when we downloaded the available documents the request was not fulfilled completely.\n We requested Dates of Service 09/14/2022 thru 07/29/2024, however we only received Dates of Service in 2024. The provided records do note prior visits in 2023 which were not included. Also, we requested Certified Billing as well and No Billing was provided.\n Please contact our office to discuss this matter in further detail. We have attached our original request & the provided documents for reference.\nSarena M.

The case is currently in the litigation phase, with discovery proceedings underway.\nThe most recent activity includes the plaintiff's attorney filing and serving discovery responses to the defense counsel on January 3, 2025. The attorney also provided a Dropbox link for document production related to these responses. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the client's ongoing housing situation. Timothy Ruhl purchased a new home in October but is experiencing delays in setting it on the foundation. He has to move by March 24, 2025, and is concerned about potential extra storage and hotel fees. (See details)\nThe next steps include following up on medical records requests, particularly from ENT, which are overdue and approaching 90 days since the initial request. It's crucial to obtain these records to meet discovery deadlines and ensure they are not excluded from payment consideration. (See details), (See details)",

We contacted the Property Office and they requested we contact you. However, he & Maureen Abrasevic, reached out to us in regard to the housing issue. They provided the attached pictures yesterday and stated that the ceiling fell in, in November and the complex has done nothing about the mold or water damage. They did patch the ceiling, but there seems to still be moisture in the ceiling/walls. From our understanding multiple units are affected and several tenants are being forced to move due to the issue. Our client is in the process of moving out as well and simply requests their February Rent be refunded and not to be charged for March. They will vacate the property by the end of March as they are simply awaiting a final inspection of their new home to be scheduled. They are very concerned that the property office will simply find a new tenant & not address the concerns properly.

I've discussed the matter with Property Management and reviewed the work order history for this rental unit. We respectfully reject your demand for February and March Rent. The photos you've provided seem to involve three separate maintenance requests which occurred over several months and were all addressed in a timely manner: a roof leak, an open window creating condensation and a mold spot discovered behind a piece of furniture. Each matter was addressed within a matter of days after the resident notified Resident Services. Please note that the Resident's lease includes a mold and mildew addendum outlining steps that must be taken in the event the resident suspects a mold issue. Furthermore, the Kentucky Landlord Tenant Act provides a notice and opportunity to cure process that has not been followed by the resident.\nIf the attorney representing Mr. Ruhl (who is not a party to the written lease) would like to discuss this further, please have him or her contact me using the information below. Though I am admittedly unclear as to Whaley Law Firm's representation in this matter, I am happy to provide any clarification that may be necessary.\nThank you,\nD.

We contacted the Property Office and they requested we contact you. However, he & Maureen Abrasevic, reached out to us in regard to the housing issue. They provided the attached pictures yesterday and stated that the ceiling fell in, in November and the complex has done nothing about the mold or water damage. They did patch the ceiling, but there seems to still be moisture in the ceiling/walls. From our understanding multiple units are affected and several tenants are being forced to move due to the issue. Our client is in the process of moving out as well and simply requests their February Rent be refunded and not to be charged for March. They will vacate the property by the end of March as they are simply awaiting a final inspection of their new home to be scheduled. They are very concerned that the property office will simply find a new tenant & not address the concerns properly. We look forward to hearing from you once your investigation into the matter is complete.\nSarena M.
