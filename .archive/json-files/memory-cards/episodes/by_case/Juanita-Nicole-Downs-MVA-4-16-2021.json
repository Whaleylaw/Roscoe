Your claim is in litigation which is a\nlengthy process averaging 18-24 months without any extensions or delays. At\nthis time your claim is in the Discovery Phase which is the longest of\nphases. During this phase the attorney's exchange official documents that\nrequire certification from their sources as well as other information\nrelated to the accident, injuries & treatment.\n Once we move out of the written discovery phase, we will enter an\noral discovery phase at which time, we will look to schedule depositions of\nthe defendants and any experts needed for your claim. If the Defense\nAttorney would like to take your oral statement, we will reach out to you\nabout scheduling.\n Please understand that there are a lot of things that take place on\nyour behalf without your direct participation. In the meantime, we are\nworking on your behalf and will reach out once we move into the oral\ndiscovery phase of your claim. However, if you have any questions, please\nfeel free to contact us to discuss them in further detail.\nSarena M.

The case has experienced delays due to Turner's criminal history and re-arrest.\nThe most recent activity involves attorney Bryce Koon requesting to schedule Mr. Turner's deposition after receiving his discovery responses on December 17, 2024. (See details)\nA potential risk is that Mr. Turner claims he was not driving at the time of the accident, which may complicate proving liability in the case. (See details)\nThe next recommended step is to review the discovery responses, schedule depositions, and gather evidence to prove Mr. Turner was driving. Additionally, obtaining the video of the defendant's hearing from April 15, 2021, may be crucial. (See details), (See details)",
