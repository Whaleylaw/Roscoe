Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 between 12/25/2024 and 1/24/2025...\n\nThis case appears to involve Charles Johnson, who likely received medical treatment at UL Jewish Hospital Radiology Department. The case may be related to an accident or injury, as there are mentions of PIP (Personal Injury Protection) and medical billing requests.\nThe most recent activity involves receiving correspondence from Auto Owners Insurance, including a PIP ledger and outstanding medical bills. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the uncertainty regarding a medical bill from UofL radiology. There seems to be confusion about why an \"Uncert MB\" (possibly uncertified medical bill) is attached to the medical tab. (See details)\nThe next recommended step is to follow up on the certified medical record and billing request sent to Sholanda Wilson at UofL Health for the UL Jewish Hospital Radiology Department records. This request was sent on January 10, 2025, and may require follow-up to ensure receipt and processing. (See details)",
