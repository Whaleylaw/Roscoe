(See details)\nA potential red flag is that as of January 6, 2025, the PIP adjuster had not received any completed PIP forms from the Lindsey family, which could delay the processing of their claim. (See details)\nThe next recommended step is to ensure that the PIP forms are completed and submitted to the insurance company as soon as possible, and to review the photos sent by Chase Lindsey for relevance to the case.

Chase has a final x ray for\nhis broken collarbone scheduled for april the second and hopefully we get\nfinal clearance there. No more treatment is needed. But again, he is\nscheduled for a final x ray for his collar Bone on april the second.\nElizabeth has continued treatment this following Monday, hoping that is\ngoing to be her last treatment that is been ongoing for several weeks now.\nAnd then she has a final consultation meeting with that orthopedist. I\nbelieve it is in early April as well. I can get to the exact date, but\nhopefully her last treatment and then she will have 1 final assessment as\nwell. So all things considered, assuming there is no changes, we are hoping\nto have everyone cleared completely in early to mid April. So I will let\nyou know as soon as I know more, but that is the update for now. Thank you.\nAnd as always, do not hesitate to reach out to you. Appreciate it.\"\nListen to this message over your phone or log in to your RingCentral account\n with your main number, extension number,\nand password.
