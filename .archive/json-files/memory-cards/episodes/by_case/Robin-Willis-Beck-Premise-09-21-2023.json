How do I get in on crutches and with such limited space in the ADA area what am I supposed to do now? I paid for all 4 days and got to see 1 day. I am not permitted to bring a seat into the very place that landed me with a broken ankle with crutches because the ADA section is so small????? I have came to your concert for so many years that I can not even describe the amount of disappointment in this situation that I NEVER ASKED TO BE IN!!!!!

I need a contact person for your event insurance because of the reasons listed below? At this rate do I need to contact an attorney? I?m sitting here with a broken ankle due to poor lighting/no signage stating that there was a drop off of 6-7 inches. I wasn?t even going to go the lawyer route but now I am seriously considering it because I keep getting replies talking about ticket insurance when that IS NOT WHAT INSURANCE I NEED A CONTACT FOR????\nI need a contact for whoever you have insurance with for the event for bodily damage?? I AM NOT NEEDING A CONTACT FOR TICKET INSURANCE! I stated that repeatedly in the last 3 emails!!!!! I was injured at YOUR CONCERT and I can prove it with pictures and paperwork as well as witness statements.\nThank You!\nRobin Willis Beck\n1214 Pigeon Pass Rd\nLouisville KY 40213\n502-260-2827\nDancel E (Front Gate Tickets NA)\nSep 29, 2023, 20:30 GMT+1\nHello Robin,There was no ticket insurance purchase or included on this order.

I need to know the contact info for the insurance company that you use for injuries occurring during the concert. I never asked for a refund? I need to know who to contact because I have hospital and medical bills along with now lost wages due to either there being no markings to show that there is a major drop off from the grass onto the concrete or at the very least lighting so you could see the drop off that broke my ankle?\nThank You!\nRobin Willis Beck\n1214 Pigeon Pass Rd\nLouisville KY 40213\n502-260-2827\nDancel E (Front Gate Tickets NA)\nSep 29, 2023, 17:58 GMT+1\nHello Robin,\u00a0Thanks for reaching out to us about a refund.

I have a picture of the 6-7 inch drop off. I contacted you guys to see how I would go about getting into the concert for the remaining 3 days due to being in a wheel chair and crutches. Someone did respond to let me know that I would use their reply to get back into the concert if there were issues with security. I sent a reply to ask for the insurance contact but no one has responded. I even order my tickets as did my family for 2024 already this morning. So 6 people including me and my husband are coming in 2024 so it?s not like I?m hating on you guys for this happening. However there being no light or markings to warn that there was about a 6-7 inch drop off I fell due to it and now my ankle is broken. I need insurance contact information because my insurance is wanting me to get it. Attaching the pictures below.\nAttachment(s)IMG_9777.jpegIMG_8473.jpeg\ntrigger_logic_for_fgt\n[9PVL01-7E7KR]",

We appreciate your efforts in facilitating this process and are agreeable to the seven-day extension.\nAdditionally, we are agreeable to dismissal without prejudice of the government Defendants, with the understanding that the claims will be preserved, and the defendants may potentially be brought back into this litigation subject to discovery of new information. That being said, I would prefer to receive an Answer on behalf of Danny Wimmer Presents prior to the filing of any Agreed Order of Dismissal.\nThank you for your attention to these matters, and we look forward to resolving this issue in an efficient and cooperative manner.\nW.

Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, et al\nCounsel,\nPlease note that Danny Wimmer Presents has accepted the defense tender of KSFB and its employees. As such, all defendants will be under the client umbrella of Reminger. Given this development, I would like to request one last good faith extension of seven days, until Friday April 5, 2024, to provide responses for the defendants to your clients complaint. Please let me know if this is agreeable and I thank you for your amenability to date regarding our responses to allow me to get the tender issue sorted out.\nAs to Kentucky State Fair Board, I want to make a formal request that it and its employees be released from the subject lawsuit. KSFB is a governmental entity enshrined in state statute, See KRS 247.100, et seq, and operates as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. Hensler and Mr. McCoy are Executive members of the KSFB governmental staff, and their functions as outlined in your clients complaint are undisputably discretionary in nature. To the extent your client feels it has a separate and distinct claim of civil negligence against KSFB and its employees, she should proceed against those entities by filing a claim in the Board of Claims. Otherwise, governmental immunity and qualified official immunity will bar the claims against KSFB and its employees in the circuit court. As to voluntary dismissal, KSFB and its employees would be amenable to a dismissal without prejudice.\nYour client\u2019s complaint facially alleges an injury sustained while a patron of Louder Than Life, hosted by Danny Wimmer Presents, and appears to allege that she sustained injury while within the portion of premises leased and controlled by Danny Wimmer. As such, DWP will be preparing an Answer to the Complaint and will be the primary party engaging in civil discovery with your client.\nPlease review at your convenience the above requests and let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may be able to address. Happy to jump on the phone and discuss these matters in more detail. Thank you both for your attention to these matters.\nBest,\n\u00a0 My Bio |\u00a0 \u00a0Website\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0vCard\nT? 502-625-7306F? 502-589-5436M 703-517-9480 www.reminger.com\nSteven B.

Please let me know the name of an ortho doctor that you would recommend as my ankle is STILL very much swollen and painful yet I have gotten no relief from any doctor or even medication since day 1 of this injury.\nThank You!\nRobin L Willis Beck\n502-260-2827\n1214 Pigeon Pass Rd\nLouisville KY 40213\nrlwbeck2017@gmail.com\nOn Wed, Oct 11, 2023 at 3:40?AM The Whaley Law Firm > wrote:\nThank you for contacting The Whaley Law Firm regarding your claim.

(See details)\nA potential red flag is that some medical providers listed are unrelated or have no records, which could complicate the case. The team is following up on missing records, particularly from Baptist Ortho. (See details)\nNext steps include preparing the client for the upcoming deposition and following up on outstanding medical records requests, especially those that are 60 days overdue.

A couple of points:\n 1. Written discovery. I\u2019ve met with my folks and we are searching internally for responsive documents to finalize responses and production. I would like to request an extension of about two weeks until August 15, 2025, to provide full responses to your client\u2019s discovery. I believe it is presently due tomorrow.\n 1. Corporate Rep. I have a decent understanding of who will be designated for the 30.02 deposition, but I want to make sure we have the right folk(s) designated. Would you be agreeable to sending a draft notice that includes the formal list of topics, and with that I can finalize designations and provide firm dates so that you can finalize the notice and file? This is how I\u2019ve proceeded in the past and it makes the process pretty smooth.\nFinally, I have authority for one more increase in our settlement offer: $15,000 inclusive of any liens for full confidential settlement of your client\u2019s claims.

I can be reached at 502-260-2827, um, if you could just give me a call, just a touch base and kind of say where we are at again, this is Robin Willis back 502-260-2827, and it is about the later than life accident injury.",

Bluehs [KBluehs@reminger.com](mailto:KBluehs@reminger.com)\nAaron,\nI\u2019m in the process of finalizing and verifying our discovery now, should have it to you in a couple days. Then we can see about resolution.\nBest,\nSteven B. Lowery, Esq. - 502-625-7306 (direct)\nReminger Co., L.P.A.\nFrom: Aaron Whaley\nTo: Steven B. Lowery\nCc: Robin Willis Beck SF 09/21/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address ; Kristin M. Bluehs\nSteven, I hope this finds you well. When can we expect to get those discovery answers? I understand that there is an offer that you have made, but it does make it hard to evaluate an offer when there's some pretty basic pending discovery. If you've already sent it and I've missed it, I apologize.\nOn Thu, Oct 2, 2025 at 2:18?PM Steven B. Lowery > wrote:\nAaron,\nLook forward to working with you. We have some outstanding discovery to answer to your client which will be delivered in short order. Otherwise, we made an increased offer to settle at $15,000. Given Ms. Beck\u2019s medicals and the photographs we\u2019ve submitted of the general location where she testified to falling that night (indicating the lighting present), we feel that is a fair offer and I do not anticipate receiving additional authority. I recall any response from your client.\nAbsent agreement, we\u2019ll need to respond to your written discovery. Bryce also indicated he wanted a corporate rep depo but didn\u2019t submit a proposed topic list. From there, we probably need a trial date.\nLet me know your thoughts on the above. Happy to jump on the phone to discuss in more detail.\nBest,\nSteven B. Lowery, Esq. - 502-625-7306 (direct)\nReminger Co., L.P.A.\nFrom: Aaron Whaley >\nTo: Steven B. Lowery >; Robin Willis Beck SF 09/21/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address >\nSubject: Robin Willis Beck\nHey Stephen, I'm following up with you on this case. Bryce is no longer working in my office, and I'm taking over this litigation. Looks like the last bit of correspondence between you and Bryce was at the end of July or 1st of August. I'm trying to see where we are, what we need to do to get this moving.\nThanks.\nBye.\n--\nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022\nDisclaimer\nThe information contained in this communication from the sender is confidential.
