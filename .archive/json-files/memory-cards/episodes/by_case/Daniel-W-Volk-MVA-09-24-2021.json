At this time I am not in a position to accept this offer. Mr. Volk is still experiencing neck and shoulder pain as well as radicular symptoms. He has been unable to follow up because he had surgery to remove a meningioma from his brain. After he has recovered he will pursue potential surgical options as advised by Aptiva health on his 12/28 follow up exam. Additionally, while I do have a copy of his Dec page that shows the UIM coverage it does not provide limits. WOuld you mind disclosing the UIM limits?\nOn Tue, Aug 23, 2022 at 4:13 PM Moore, Ebon > wrote:\n[http://image.email-libertymutual.com/lib/fecc16717d67067e/m/1/Safeco+logo_3x.png]\n[http://image.email-libertymutual.com/lib/fecc16717d67067e/m/1/Go+Confidently_3x.png]\nMr. Whaley,\nI am writing in response to your demand letter of August 4, 2022.

I do still have some restriction in my neck movement and some pain and weakness in my shoulder\nI did have my surgery to remove the brain tumor. I briefly spoke to the surgeon,Dr. Sun, in summary he said he did not know if there was a way to tell if the impact from the accident caused any of the problems with the tumor specifically the headaches. However, the day of the accident I went to an immediate care/emergency room with my injuries including headache. I had not had problems with headaches before the accident but had then since the accident all the way up until the time of the tumor surgery and have not had headaches sense. \nOn January 18 I have a follow up MRI for the remainder of the tumor that could not be removed and a follow up with the surgeon in February\n\nI also have all the medical records related to the brain tumor prior to the surgery if they are needed I can provide them in order to avoid having to pay the hospital to reproduce them. Thank you for your attention please feel free to contact me at any time #cc",

I have attached the record from Aptiva\nthat led to the brain MRI. This is the diagnostic that discovered\nmeningioma. While he was having shoulder and neck pain, the headaches were\nin the occipital lobe. This is not where you would normally find referred\nhead pain. That is why the doctor ordered a brain MRI. The location of his\nheadaches is very near where they discovered the mengioma. I will follow up\nwith emails that have his PCP priors.

It is Kim. With Liberty Mutual calling you back regarding this claim for Daniel Volk, I reviewed those 3 medical records that you sent to us just his prior records, showing that he did not have any headache complaints before the accident that basically confirms my point that he did not have this any headaches, but after this accident, the Headaches were caused from the neck pain, and that led to the MRI that led to them finding the brain tumor. So not sure how any of or this accident could have caused something you did not even know he had. So right now, my value or my offer remains the same. He got 25 from the tort and we they have waived segregation and my offer that I had given to Bri.",

    "episode_body": "On 2024-08-26, Aaron Whaley emailed Kimberle Pishke:\n\nCase: Daniel-W-Volk-MVA-09-24-2021\nClient: Daniel W Volk\n__Dan Volk #047060829__\nKim, thank you for the call earlier. I listened to your message and I\nwanted to email you in the hopes of clearing up our position. You made a\nstatement in the voicemail that is not supported by any documentation. You\nsaid that the headaches were caused by neck pain, which led to the MRI that\nfound the meningioma. No medical record supports that conclusion. A brain\nMRI for radiating neck pain is not normal. I want to give you a\nhypothetical.\nDan lives his life normally. Dan doesn't have any neck pain. However, Dan\nhas a C3-C4 herniated disc in his neck. This herniated disc is not causing\nany stenosis and there are no symptoms from the herniated disc. If this was\nfound on an MRI, the doctors would not perform surgery to correct it since\nit was asymptomatic. No doctor would be able to say within a reasonable\ndegree of medical certainty that the herniated disc would ever become\nsymptomatic. Now, Dan gets into an accident. He was hit from behind. After\nthe accident, he begins to have symptoms related to the herniated disc. The\nAsymptomatic has become Symptomatic. His doctor then performs surgery to\ncorrect the herniated disc.\nIn the above example, you would have no problem agreeing that the accident\ncaused an aggravation of a preexisting condition. There would be no issue\nwith relating the surgery to correct the herniated disc to the accident.\nReplace herniated disc with mengioma in the example and you have the exact\nsame thing as here. There is no way to know if the menengioma would have\never become symptomatic. It may have sat there in his head, doing nothing.\nHowever, after the trauma of the accident, the mengioma became syptomatic\nand had to be removed. That means the need for removal was caused by the\naccident, just as the herinated disc repair was in the hypothetical.\nYou cannot think of the meningioma as if it were some cancerous brain\ntumor. If it was, then yes, it would have to come out or be treated in some\nway at some point. The accident could then be viewed as a happy misfortune.\nA meningioma is not the same. They are not cancers. They do not grow\naggressively. They do not have to be removed if they are not causing\nsymptoms.\nHere is a link to some information on Meningioma treatment. Notice the\nfirst paragraph: \"Meningioma treatment is not always necessary, especially\nin situations where the tumors are small, noncancerous, and not causing the\npatient any discomfort. Benign meningiomas may be addressed with \u201cwatchful\nwaiting,\u201d in which physicians carefully monitor a patient with regular\nimaging scans and physical exams but do not make any treatment\nrecommendations unless symptoms develop or the tumor starts to spread.\"\nhttps://www.moffitt.org/cancers/meningioma/treatment/\nI have attached the 12/13/2021 Norton Cancer Institute record as well.\n\"This lesion was discovered upon headaches after motor vehicle accident.\"--\nKim, We know this to be true. Prior to the accident, Dan had an\nasymptomatic meningioma. There is no evidence that it would have needed\nremoval at any future time. After the accident, the meningioma became\nsymptomatic and needed to be removed. BECASUE THE ACCIDENT CAUSED THE\nMENINGIOMA TO BECOME SYMPTOMATIC.\nThanks.\nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022",

I will address your\nresponse in order.\n1. You state that Mr. Volk's headaches could be from the cervicle injury,\nand his doctors do not attribute his headaches to the meningioma.\nYes, cervical injuries can result in referred pain to the head. However,\neven if his neck injury caused some headache symptoms, his doctor states\nthat the meningioma is the cause. Additionally, Mr. Volk had other symptoms\nrelated to the meningioma that he did not have before. On 12/13.21, Dr.\nSorah notes that Dan is having intermittent left hemibody sensation changes\nmost predominant in the leg. Mr. V\u00f6lk saw Dr. Sun on 01/22/2022. Dr. Sun\nnotes headaches as well as intermittent paresthesias in his left lower\nextremity as symptoms of the meningioma. What is important is that before\nthe accident there were no headaches, no parasthesia, and no sensation\nissues. After the accident, the symptoms develop. Additionally, I just saw\nthat the MRI also showed a small amount of edema, or swelling around the\nmeningioma. None of the Dr's address the significance of the edema, but\nthat sure does sound to me like it could be the result of the trauma, which\nis why he is now symptomatic.\n2. Mr. Volk could do nothing or have surgery. Mr. Volk chose surgery, so\nit's not related to the accident.\nUnless a person is in an ER, all surgery is a choice. A person with a\nherniated disc has a choice for a spinal fusion or do nothing. If they\nchoose surgery, that would not mean the accident did not lead to the choice\nand therefore the surgery. Additionally, in the present case, Mr. Volk did\nhave a choice but his doctor recommended surgery. Dr. Sun on 4/29/22 lays\nout options of continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy. He\nthen goes on to recommend craniotomy.\n3. You claim that he would have had to have the meningioma removed\neventually.\nHis doctor giving him the option of continuing surveillance directly\ncontradicts that. You cite a paragraph from Mt. Sinai Hospital's website\nfor the proposition that meningioma must be removed. Yet, on that same\nwebsite, on the page about treatment of meningioma, there is this\nparagraph:If your tumor is growing slowly and does not affect your health,\nwe may choose to observe your tumor at scheduled intervals rather than\ntreat it immediately. We might schedule you for regular magnetic resonance\nimaging scans to\nmonitor the tumor's growth.\"\nhttps://www.mountsinai.org/care/neurosurgery/services/meningiomas/treatments-procedures\nSo, your own source says that sometimes just watching and waiting is an\noption. Just like Mr. Volk's Dr.'s.\nAt the end of the day, these are the uncontroverted facts.\n1. Prior to the accident, Mr. Volk did not have a problem with headaches or\nleg parasthesia.\n2. After the accident, Mr. Volk had persistent headaches that led to a\nbrain MRI.\n3. The brain MRI revealed a small meningioma.\n4. Mr. Volk's neurologist and cancer doctor both relate that the headaches\nand the parasthesia he was experiencing were due to the meningioma.\n5. Mr. Volks neurologist recommended surgical removal of the\nmeningoma, which Mr. Volk agreed to.\n6. Mr. Volk undergoes a craniotomy.\nSo, either as a manner of great coincidence, Mr. Volk has a meningioma that\nis completely asymptomatic until immediately following a car accident and\nwholly unrelated to the car accident; he then begins to have symptoms and\nsubsequent removal of the meningioma\nor\nMr. Volk has an asymptomatic meningioma that becomes symptomatic after the\ntrauma of the car accident and has to have it removed.\nThank you. Have a great day.\nOn Tue, Aug 27, 2024 at 10:28?AM Pischke, Kimberle <\nkimberle.pischke@libertymutual.com> wrote:\n>\n>\n> Aaron,\n>\n>\n>\n> Thank you for your response.

The accident does not need\nto cause the tumor for it to be compensable. The accident needs to cause\nthe symptoms from the tumor to appear. He was completely asymptomatic prior\nto the accident. The force of the accident caused the tumor to shift\nslightly and that leads to the symptoms. The fact that the tumor is now\nsymptomatic is why it had to be removed. This is exactly like a\npre-existing herniated disc that is asymptomatic prior to an accident. The\naccident causes the herniated disc to shift and it is now pressing on\nnerves and causing symptoms.\nThe day of the accident Dan goes to OSF Prompt Care. He does not report\nneck pain. He does report a headache along the left temporal and parietal\nregion. Headaches from whiplash or referred neck pain are most commonly at\nthe base of the skull near the neck. Dan had a headache that was in the\nleft temproal lobe and left parietal lobe. Basically the side of the head\nnear the ear to the top of the head in the middle. Not at all what you\nwould expect from a whiplash injury. It is, however, what you would expect\nfrom a headache caused by the meningioma. His headaches were caused by the\nmeningioma. Not whiplash. There were no headaches before the accident. So\nthe accident caused the headaches from the meningioma.\nYou keep mentioning that the meningioma was an incidental finding as if\nthat has some relevance. It isn't. It just means it was not something they\nwere looking for when they did the brain MRI.\nOn Fri, Sep 6, 2024 at 7:57?AM Pischke, Kimberle <\nkimberle.pischke@libertymutual.com> wrote:\n> Aaron,\n>\n>\n>\n> I am doing well, thanks for asking.\n>\n>\n>\n> In response to your previous email, as I had indicated and pointed out in\n> the medical records Dr. Piticock, Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Sorah have all\n> indicated the meningioma was an incidental finding after complaints of\n> headaches after the accident, they do not indicate the tumor was caused by\n> the accident.\n>\n>\n>\n> I am willing to increase my offer exclusive of PIP of $28,500 new money\n> to resolve the claim.\n>\n>\n>\n> Best Regards,\n>\n>\n>\n> *Kim Pischke *\n>\n> Sr. Claims Resolution Specialist III, Cas\n>\n> ------------\n>\n> USRM Casualty Claims\n>\n> *USPS Mail (no FedEx or UPS): *P.O.

Just like Mr. Volk's Dr.'s.\n>\n>\n>\n> At the end of the day, these are the uncontroverted facts.\n>\n> 1. Prior to the accident, Mr. Volk did not have a problem with headaches\n> or leg parasthesia.\n>\n> 2. After the accident, Mr. Volk had persistent headaches that led to a\n> brain MRI.\n>\n> 3. The brain MRI revealed a small meningioma.\n>\n> 4. Mr. Volk's neurologist and cancer doctor both relate that the headaches\n> and the parasthesia he was experiencing were due to the meningioma.\n>\n> 5. Mr. Volks neurologist recommended surgical removal of the\n> meningoma, which Mr. Volk agreed to.\n>\n> 6. Mr. Volk undergoes a craniotomy.\n>\n>\n>\n> So, either as a manner of great coincidence, Mr. Volk has a meningioma\n> that is completely asymptomatic until immediately following a car accident\n> and wholly unrelated to the car accident; he then begins to have symptoms\n> and subsequent removal of the meningioma\n>\n> or\n>\n> Mr. Volk has an asymptomatic meningioma that becomes symptomatic after the\n> trauma of the car accident and has to have it removed.\n>\n>\n>\n> Thank you.

The\nsymptomatic nature of the meningioma and not the mere existence of it is\nthe reason that it had to be removed.
