This wreck has really put a strain on my mental stand point, I have nothing to drive and finding a way to get anywhere has been a struggle, I've sent all the proof to prove my innocence and how my insurance company has really let me down, I've heard nothing from them and I've done all their work for them by collecting pictures of the scene and the damage to the vehicle, the fact they lied and said I did not have my lights on but I have daytime running lights plus there was pole lights in a buisness area where he hit me. This is so frustrating m, I can't even get to Lexington to see my pain Dr to get my meds, so this has really been a emotional rollercoaster I've been on.

The case has progressed from the treatment phase to negotiation, and there have been discussions about settlement offers.The most recent activity shows that Jessa Galosmo requested a PIP ledger and sent a fax related to this request on January 20, 2025. (See details), (See details)A potential red flag is the delay in responding to the insurance adjuster's settlement offer. The adjuster, Zack Grizzle, mentioned making a $10,000 offer on December 23, 2023, but had not received a counter-demand as of December 26, 2024. (See details)The next recommended step is to review the PIP ledger once received, prepare a counter-demand based on the additional medical billing information sent to the adjuster, and follow up with the insurance company to continue settlement negotiations.
