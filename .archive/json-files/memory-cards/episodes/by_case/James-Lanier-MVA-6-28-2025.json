I'm sure that you are aware that in Alabama, the scene of the accident, \u201cshared fault\u201d in rear-end collision claims are governed by the legal doctrine of contributory negligence, meaning that if you are even 1% at fault for the accident, you are barred from recovering any damages whatsoever, even if the other driver was primarily responsible, according to legal resources. This strict standard makes proving fault in rear-end collisions crucial for obtaining compensation in Alabama.\nI can prove that I provided enough time and space to responsibly stop in a manner to remain safe and not collide with the car in front of me. The car behind me cannot say the same nor can they prove that they were prudent in providing the same level of care as I did to provide enough time and space to successfully avoid hitting me. Hence, they were clearly negligent.\nWe were traveling at about 50 mph. If the driver had provided 5 car lengths of distance between my car and theirs, then they could have successfully avoided hitting me and my family from behind.\nThe indisputable fact is that the driver\u2019s speed, lack of distance between their car and mine, and lack of good judgement left the driver negligent from doing everything possible to successfully avoid hitting me and my family from behind.\nThe other indisputable fact is that if the driver did use good judgement, and the driver did leave enough time and space, and the driver did do everything possible to avoid a collision, then there would have been zero chance of the driver ever hitting me.\nBest Regards,\nJim Lanier\n513-288-8834",

Given my age, the success rate for repairable surgery is under 40%. Therefore, my doctor recommends debridement surgery to remove dead tissue from the torn labrum, which will aid in the growth of healthy tissue and improve shoulder function. My doctor is also concerned about my ongoing severe neck muscle spasms and has scheduled an MRI to assess my neck. The MRI results will dictate the timing of my shoulder surgery. The cost estimate provided by my doctor shows that this type of surgery will cost approximately $17,000 and will provide you with that documentation.\n\nI would like to set up a brief call with you to discuss further.",
