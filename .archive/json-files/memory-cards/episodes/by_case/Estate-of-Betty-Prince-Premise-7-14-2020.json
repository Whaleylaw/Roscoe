I walked beside her aiding her from the house to my car. After I drove 60+ miles to Norton's Hospital, I parked in the guest parking lot. Betty Prince was unable to walk into the facility without help. I Robert Prince walked beside her for stability and direction. When we entered the hospital we both completed the Covid screening procedures, which was a temperature check and answered a few questions. Betty stood during this activity while holding to my arm.\u00a0 Betty walked to the admitting room with my help. When we reached the registration office Betty had become weaker, and her pace and endurance had lessened and her breathing was shallower and labored.\n\nUpon arrival in the waiting room of the registration office, Betty was seated in a chair. After a shot interval the office employee called her name and I helped her stand. As was previously stated Betty was weak and short of breath. When Betty and myself reached the door way I was told because of the the regulation due to Covid I could not enter the office area.\u00a0 No assistance was offer to the patient such as a wheel chair a walker or direct personal help.\n\nAfter a short period of time the office staff employee opened the door Betty was following her. Again no assistance to ensure Betty's safety was offered.\u00a0 As Betty\u00a0 stepped into the waiting room she fell backwards hitting her head on the floor which resulted in a large cut in the back of her head .I Robert Prince immediately went to her . Betty was laying on her back in a puddle of blood. At that point no one offered any assistance in addressing her injury. nor was there anyone monitoring her vitals. I Robert Prince asked a staff member to give me a towel. when I received the towel I put pressure on the area on her head which was bleeding. Two call were made to the ER . After 10 minutes two medical staff came and transported Betty Prince to the ER. Nine stiches were put in her head, a CT Scam revealed\u00a0 active bleeding in her brain. Betty was admitted to the hospital and placed in the ICU.\u00a0 After thirty six hours she was placed in a private room. Betty remained in the private room for an additional\u00a0 thirty six hours. Betty then was released.\u00a0 An appointment was made to return in two weeks to have a CT scam to check her progress.\n\nThese are the events to best of my knowledge which occured on the day in question\n\nIf you have any additional questions please contact me\n\nSincerely\n\nRobert Prince\"",
