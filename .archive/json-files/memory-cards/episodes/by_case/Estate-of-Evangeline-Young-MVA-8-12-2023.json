The KRS makes the individual \"primarily liable\" and the proximate cause of any injuries. Legislative history makes pretty clear the intention of the dram shop act was to protect injured third-parties, not the individual being served. See KRS 413.241.",

(See details)\nA potential red flag is that Derby City Gaming is attempting to claim that Evangeline was not in their establishment on the night of the incident. The legal team has requested evidence from Dwight to prove Evangeline's presence at the venue. (See details)\nThe next steps should include reviewing Derby City Gaming's responses to discovery requests and preparing for depositions. The legal team should also follow up with Dwight to obtain any evidence proving Evangeline's presence at Derby City Gaming on the night in question. (See details), (See details)",

I typically handle the scheduling for Aaron & Bryce and unfortunately was not cc'd on any of your emails for the date request. Please be sure to include me on all future correspondence for the quickest updates.\n Mr. Young is a 3rd shift worker and it is a bit difficult to get a hold of him during business hours. I believe it would be best handled if you provide us some dates your office is available for a 1:30p start time at least 3 weeks out and we will confirm with Mr. Young. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\nSarena M.
