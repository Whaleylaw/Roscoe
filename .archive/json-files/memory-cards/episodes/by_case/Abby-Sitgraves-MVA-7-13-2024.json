The incident appears to be a limo accident, with at least one passenger involved.\nThe most recent activity is the filing of a complaint and discovery requests on January 8, 2025, moving the case into the litigation phase. (See details)\nA potential red flag is that Abby Sitgraves had a prior MVA on July 9, 2023, which was settled for $9,500. This could impact the current case's valuation or credibility. (See details)\nThe next steps should include perfecting service on the defendants, particularly the unknown driver, and following up on the request for certified medical records from various providers.

It\u2019s our belief that there is PIP coverage for $10,000. However, you will have to confirm that with the NIC adjuster who is handling the PIP claim. This is Jordan Bahr who can be reached at 402 \u2013 916 -3036; jabahr@nationalindemnity.com. It will be the same claim number you have been using.\nFor the UM claims, we are currently in a holding pattern because one claimant is still treating and thus has not submitted their medical proofs.\nRegarding the negligence claims against CAAL Worldwide, do you plan to dismiss these claims? It is our stance that any negligence claim cannot co-exist with the UM claim.\nThank you,\nSam\nSam Leffert\nAssociate\nBlackburn Domene & Burchett, pllc\n614 West Main Street, Suite 3000\nLouisville, KY 40202\n502.584.1600 \u2013 Office\n502.584.9971 \u2013 Fax\nsleffert@bdblawky.com\nwww.bdblawky.com\nNOTICE: This e-mail message and any attachment to this e-mail message contains confidential information that may be legally privileged.

They want to proceed against the limousine company. So we're going to have to hold off on resolving the uninsured motorist claim. The attorneys for the other plaintiffs are Bruce Anderson, John Doyle, and Seth Gladstein. And Marshall Rowland is actually going to be the one handling it for Seth.",
