Travelers, et al. (Jefferson 23-CI-005758), likely a legal dispute related to an insurance claim or accident.\nThe most recent activity shows that Bryce Koon agreed to an extension for discovery responses until February 10, 2025, as Charlie Walker from Sewell and Neal is substituting as counsel of record for Mr. Kiper. (See details)\nA potential risk is the change in defense counsel, which could delay proceedings or alter the case strategy. The new attorney will need time to get up to speed on the case. (See details)\nThe next step is to follow up on the discovery responses after the agreed-upon extension date of February 10, 2025. It's important to ensure that the new defense counsel provides the requested information by this deadline. (See details)",
