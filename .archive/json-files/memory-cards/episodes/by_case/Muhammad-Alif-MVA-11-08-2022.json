These tests are performed to better identify traumatic brain\n> injury.\n>\n>\n> The TBI battery includes:\n>\n> -\n>\n> Oculomotor assessment - $2,000\n>\n> -\n>\n> Neurocognitive testing - $2,200\n>\n> -\n>\n> Posturography this battery - $500\n>\n> -\n>\n> Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology - $8,000\n>\n>\n>\n> -\n>\n> The DTI/MRI - $8,000\n>\n>\n>\n> If you would like to learn more about how multifactorial testing is\n> beneficial for identifying brain injuries please click the following link (\n> http://meet.ceostx.com\n> )\n> to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano. If you are unable to\n> find time or would like to speak with him directly please contact him at\n> drmatt@ceostx.com\n>\n> Indications:\n>\n> Oculomotor assessment: brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision,\n> foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues,\n> trouble sleeping, and mood changes blurred vision, double vision, nausea,\n> dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning\n> sensation, lightheadedness\n>\n>\n>\n> Posturography: brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness,\n> falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, lightheadedness\n>\n>\n>\n> Neurocognitive testing: can help determine the areas of the brain that are\n> impacted by a TBI and how these impairments are impacting your day-to-day\n> functioning. More importantly, testing can also determine how other factors\n> (e.g. depression, anxiety, life stress) are impacting your cognitive\n> functioning, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability,\n> forgetfulness, anxiety, post-traumatic stress.\n>\n>\n>\n> Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: the most sophisticated,\n> state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available. Visualize\n> live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus,\n> Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity\n> simultaneously. Brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes\n> (encephalopathy), memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog,\n> irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline.\n>\n>\n>\n> DTI/MRI: Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses\n> anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of\n> the brain. Fiber tractography (FT) is a 3D reconstruction technique to\n> assess neural tracts using data collected by diffusion tensor imaging. A\n> non-invasive medical imaging tool is used to investigate the structure of\n> white matter that is damaged during a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) without\n> any neurological symptoms\n>\n> Please reply back accepting or denying requests. *Additionally, please\n> attach a LOP if testing is approved! *\n>\n--\nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022",

Can you please clarify which\nspeech pathologist you are referring to? Norton Community Hospital is not a\nproper location. Please provide the doctor's name and address.\n As we have discussed multiple times, we do not know the policy limits\nof your 1st accident and the insurance company is not required to disclose\nthis information.\n Also, we do not have a 'patient ledger' for your treatment to date. As\nadvised, we are still awaiting quite a few sets of medical records and\nbilling associated with your treatment and to our knowledge, no providers\nhave been paid to date. As far as the demand package, you will have to\nfollow up with Aaron on that. To my knowledge a Demand Package can not be\nsent until all medical records and bills have been obtained and you have\ncompleted treatment. I have, however, updated your bodily injury adjuster\nwith the medical records and bills that we do have on file but this is not\na formal demand and no offers were made based on the information provided.\nIf you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us to\ndiscuss them in further detail.\nSarena M.

Dr. Hwang recommends the following procedures: Oculomotor assessment, Posturography, Neurocognitive testing, Brain Mapping, and MRI/DTI prior to treatment. These tests are performed to better identify traumatic brain injury. The TBI battery includes:Oculomotor assessment - $2,000Neurocognitive testing - $2,200Posturography this battery - $500Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology - $8,000The DTI/MRI - $8,000If you would like to learn more about how multifactorial testing is beneficial for identifying brain injuries please click the following link (http://meet.ceostx.com) to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano. If you are unable to find time or would like to speak with him directly please contact him at drmatt@ceostx.com Indications: Oculomotor assessment: brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision, foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, and mood changes blurred vision, double vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, lightheadedness Posturography: brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, lightheadedness Neurocognitive testing: can help determine the areas of the brain that are impacted by a TBI and how these impairments are impacting your day-to-day functioning. More importantly, testing can also determine how other factors (e.g. depression, anxiety, life stress) are impacting your cognitive functioning, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available. Visualize live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously. Brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes (encephalopathy), memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline. DTI/MRI: Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain. Fiber tractography (FT) is a 3D reconstruction technique to assess neural tracts using data collected by diffusion tensor imaging. A non-invasive medical imaging tool is used to investigate the structure of white matter that is damaged during a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) without any neurological symptoms\n ---Administration Axon Medical CentersDallas | Houston | San Antonio | El Paso | AustinPhone: 855-296-6824The information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

Please understand that\nlitigation is a very expensive and lengthy process and should not be taken\nlightly, at this time, we will not be filing a civil suit.

Dr. Hwang recommends the following procedures: Brain Mapping, and MRI/DTI prior to treatment. These tests are performed to better identify traumatic brain injury. The TBI battery includes:Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology - $8,000The DTI/MRI - $8,000If you would like to learn more about how multifactorial testing is beneficial for identifying brain injuries please click the following link (http://meet.ceostx.com) to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano. If you are unable to find time or would like to speak with him directly please contact him at drmatt@ceostx.com Indications: Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available. Visualize live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously. Brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes (encephalopathy), memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline. DTI/MRI: Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain. Fiber tractography (FT) is a 3D reconstruction technique to assess neural tracts using data collected by diffusion tensor imaging. A non-invasive medical imaging tool is used to investigate the structure of white matter that is damaged during a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) without any neurological symptoms\n Please reply back accepting or denying requests.

Alif. We are going to reopen this request, as it seems that we would be able to process dates of service 11/8/21-1/18/23. This is up to the date of the signature. If records are needed past the date of signature, we would need an updated authorization to say something along the lines of \"I authorize any past, present, or future visits until authorization expires\" or \"I authorize the release of records created after the date of signature\".\nI hope this helps to clarify. If you end up receiving a revised authorization, please feel free to send this request to me directly for importing & processing.\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\nThank you,\nLauren S.
