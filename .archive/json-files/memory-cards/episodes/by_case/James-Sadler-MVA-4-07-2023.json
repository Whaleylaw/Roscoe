The techs at Pro Rehab assured me there was one contact to get case history from. I was there for 7 sessions for an hour or more and exercises daily in between for 3-4 weeks.__\nHi James,\nWe are still waiting for the records and bills from Pro Rehab. I did a\nfollow up again with them today and resend the request. I was assured they\nalready received the request and submitted it to the records department. I\ntried to call the records dept. but I am only getting voicemail. Regarding\nthe deductible, yes it will be included in the final settlement.\nOn Wed, Aug 23, 2023 at 10:59?AM James Sadler wrote:\n> State Farm told my significant and me that although their insured was at\n> fault, they had to apply our $500 deductible.

Returning your call on the Murphy file. Yes, it was set up for authority. And then upper management requested information from the OCS on both both parties. So I am waiting on both insurance companies. I have spoken to both adjusters at I think it is country country wide in also progressive We requested a letter stating pit sub was waived on the first claim. Once I have that, it looks like upper management will give authority, but that is what I am waiting on. I am waiting on the other insurance companies to provide us those letters. So once we get those 2 letters, I will send over offers. Thank you so much. Have a great day.",

Went to the same dentist and had it repaired. DOS: 10/23/23 and cost was $498.00. Need to make sure this is not included with demand to SF.\nOn upcoming Monday, they are set to extract tooth cracked in accident. Client says the plan is to leave that tooth open for another couple of months. Client will be in Gulf Shores, AL from Jan-Mar and may not be able to get subsequent treatment until his return. He will call with update following extraction Monday.",

He said following his MVA he was experiencing a lot of pain - but did not realize his tooth had suffered a crack due to the accident. His employer's insurance covered some of the cost of implant - but he has spent approximately $2,000+ out of pocket so far. He will continue to update us. He was not entirely sure of the dental facility name - but said he will get that info for us. #cc",

They made an offer of $5500 without dental records and bills, and\nup to 7688 when they got them. I countered at 35k and they said they are\nstaying at 7688.

I had to work without pain medication since I handle tens of thousands of dollars each shift during the months of May, June, September and November these past 21 months.\nAfter the shattered tooth was pulled, I had to do without my lower jaw tooth while the pocket healed for the new tooth. This period was also very painful. I finally got the new tooth over a year after the accident.\nI saw the guilty party about to run the red light about 50 yards out.
