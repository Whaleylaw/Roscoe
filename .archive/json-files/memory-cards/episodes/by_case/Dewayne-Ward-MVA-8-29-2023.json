The case is currently in a holding pattern, awaiting legal proceedings to move forward.\nThe most recent activity involves client contact on January 13, 2025. The client called for an update, and the legal team is buying time until they can provide a proper update, likely by the end of the week. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the delay in filing the complaint. The legal team is waiting for approval from Indiana for e-filing and access to MyCase Odyssey for E-Filing, which is causing a delay in the case progression. (See details)\nThe next recommended step is to follow up with Bryce Koon to ensure the e-filing approval is received and the complaint is filed as soon as possible. Once this is done, the client should be provided with a comprehensive update on the case status. (See details), (See details)",
