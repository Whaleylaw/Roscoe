Phase 1: Generated inventory of 51 files. Phase 2: Analyzed all documents with content-based categorization (filenames scrambled to eliminate bias). Phase 3: Quality review identified and corrected 5 errors (16.7% error rate, below 20% threshold) - critical corrections included properly identifying police report vs insurance policy, preventing data loss. Phase 4: Successfully executed 28 operations (20 moves, 8 deletes). Phase 5: Verified 100% naming convention compliance and companion file integrity. Results: Client folder (4 PDF+MD pairs: fee agreements, intake documents), Investigation folder (2 PDF+MD pairs: police report Master File #73221680, Betty Antle's Progressive Insurance policy as evidence), Medical Records (9 PDF+MD pairs across 3 providers: UofL Hospital ER visit, Louisville Metro EMS transport/bill, Starlite Injury comprehensive treatment records), Insurance (5 PDF+MD pairs: Root PIP with $10,000 exhausted payment ledger, SafeCo BI denial letter). Deleted 4 duplicates and 4 template files. Key case information confirmed: Accident 8/19/2025, rear-end collision pushing client into school bus, SafeCo denied coverage (policy cancelled), Progressive accepted property damage liability, Root PIP fully paid to Starlite. 13 UUID-named .jpg images remain in root for manual review (likely accident scene photos, vehicle damage, insurance cards). Case now properly organized and ready for demand preparation. All reports saved to Reports/ directory.",
