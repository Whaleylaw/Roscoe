Again, Ms. Lankswert is a\nFuel Truck Driver which requires her to sit for long periods of time, lift\nheavy hoses & climb stairs, all of which causes additional pain & delays to\nher recovery. Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert in lieu of\nplacing her off work only due to the fact Concentra apparently has a\nstanding order from UPS (who are not medical professionals) to NOT place\ntheir employees off work (unethical on so many levels). Ms. Lankswert is\nnot able to drive due to being unable to sit for long periods of time, she\nis unable to lift the hoses and she is unable to repeatedly climb stairs. These\nare noted in her restrictions provided to you earlier today.\n ***May lift up to 10lbs (Hoses weigh well more than 10lbs)\n ***May push/pull up to 10 lbs (Again, hoses weigh more than\n10lbs)\n ***May bend *occasionally *(occasionally defined as upto\n3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement with\ngetting in & out of truck)\n ***May engage in activities requiring trunk rotation *occasionally\n*(again defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler this is a constant\nrequired activity)\n* ***Will need to alternate sitting & standing for pain\ncontrol *(cannot\nalternate sitting & standing as needed if actively fueling)\n* ***No squatting, kneeling or climbing ladders *(Ladders are\nrequired to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses)\n *UPS themselves, via Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor Amy Roy, have\nadvised they can not accommodate* her restrictions & that she is to sit in\nthe breakroom all evening. Sitting in a breakroom is not the equivalent to\naccommodating restrictions, especially when this is causing harm/pain\nto the injured party with a *Tailbone Injury* as documented in her Flaget\nRecords. Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an\nunbiased provider and will have updated documents later this afternoon.\nHowever, TTD should be issued for the time already missed & the\noccurrences should\nbe removed from her attendance file immediately due to UPS's strict\nadherence to their attendance policy and subsequent termination should an\nemployee use all available occurrences.\nSarena M.

Again, Ms. Lankswert is a Fuel Truck Driver which requires her to sit for long periods of time, lift heavy hoses & climb stairs, all of which causes additional pain & delays to her recovery. Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert in lieu of placing her off work only due to the fact Concentra apparently has a standing order from UPS (who are not medical professionals) to NOT place their employees off work (unethical on so many levels). Ms. Lankswert is not able to drive due to being unable to sit for long periods of time, she is unable to lift the hoses and she is unable to repeatedly climb stairs. These are noted in her restrictions provided to you earlier today.\n ***May lift up to 10lbs (Hoses weigh well more than 10lbs)\n ***May push/pull up to 10 lbs (Again, hoses weigh more than 10lbs)\n ***May bend occasionally (occasionally defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement with getting in & out of truck)\n ***May engage in activities requiring trunk rotation occasionally (again defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler this is a constant required activity)\n ***Will need to alternate sitting & standing for pain control (cannot alternate sitting & standing as needed if actively fueling)\n ***No squatting, kneeling or climbing ladders (Ladders are required to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses)\n UPS themselves, via Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor Amy Roy, have advised they can not accommodate her restrictions & that she is to sit in the breakroom all evening. Sitting in a breakroom is not the equivalent to accommodating restrictions, especially when this is causing harm/pain to the injured party with a Tailbone Injury as documented in her Flaget Records. Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an unbiased provider and will have updated documents later this afternoon. However, TTD should be issued for the time already missed & the occurrences should be removed from her attendance file immediately due to UPS's strict adherence to their attendance policy and subsequent termination should an employee use all available occurrences.\nSarena M.

Mr. Bryce Koon is the\nattorney of record for our firm, I have included his contact information\nbelow. Just to update you on the claim to date, Ms. Lankswert is a\nFull-time (8hr) Fueler for United Parcel Service, who on Friday,\nFebruary 7, 2025 fell down a set of metal stairs (photo provided) while\nwithin the scope of her employment. Ms. Lankswert immediately felt pain in\nboth elbows & her lower back from the impact on the stairs. Shortly after,\nshe was transported by another UPS Employee in their personal vehicle to\nConcentra Health on Fern Valley Road. Concentra advised Ms. Lankswert that\nthey '...are not allowed to place UPS employees off work by law, due to\ntheir account with UPS' and sent Ms. Lankswert back to full duty while\ndocumenting a limited ROM in her arms. Ms. Lankswert was off work over the\nweekend and attempted to recover at home.\n On February 11, 2025 Ms. Lankswert was still in immense pain and could\nnot await her follow up appointment with Concentra. Ms. Lankswert was seen\nat Flaget Memorial Hospital who advised Ms. Lankswert to avoid driving,\nsitting, or standing for long periods of time as well as to rest. Ms.\nLankswert then returned to Concentra on February 13, 2025, where she\nexplained to the physician that she was not able to fulfill her duties due\nto the pain & Concentra provided restrictions for Ms. Lankswert. UPS\nprovided Concentra with a job description for an 'Air Handler', not a\n'Fueler' and Concentra based their restrictions on the incorrect position\nand stated Ms. Lankswert was about to return to modified duty & work her\nfull shift. When Ms. Lankswert shared these restrictions with her immediate\nsupervisor, Amy Roy, Ms. Roy advised Ms. Lankswert that they were not able\nto accommodate her restrictions. Unfortunately, she was not scheduled to\nsee Concentra again for another 4 days, on February 17, 2025.\n From the date of her injury through February 17th, 2025, UPS made no\nmention nor took any actions to discuss workers' compensation with Ms.\nLankswert. Instead, each evening (3rd shift employee), Ms. Roy would\ncontact Ms. Lankswert & ask her how she, Ms. Lankswert, wanted her off time\nto 'coded' and given only the options of 'Call In', 'PTO' or 'Vacation'. On\nat least one occasion, Ms. Lankswert was advised the 'Board was full' and\nshe had to take a Call In Occurrence. On February 14th, Ms. Lankswert\nattempted to go in to work for her 'light duty position' and advised to sit\nin the breakroom for the evening as they had no work available for her. Ms.\nLankswert was unable to stay her whole shift as the plastic chairs & steel\nstools (photo provided) were causing more pain to her tailbone injury.\n Ms. Lankswert attended her February 17th appointment with Concentra\nand felt her injuries were not being properly addressed so she followed up\nthe next day (02.18) with Advanced Injury & Rehab who placed Ms. Lankswert\noff work until her MRI imaging results were obtained. The MRI shows at\nleast 2 bulging discs in Ms. Lankswert's lower lumbar spine and she has\nbeen ordered to physical therapy.\n To date, Ms. Lankswert still has not received any information from UPS\nin regards to her workers compensation claim. Our contact with the WC\nCarrier has been very limited and only consists of continued denial of Ms.\nLankswert's TTD benefits from the Date of her incident through February\n20th. The Adjuster is very short and only states UPS says there is\n'suitable light duty' available to Ms. Lankswert, which is in direct\ncontradiction of Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor. When asked who is\nstating there is suitable work, there is no response, only denial of\nbenefits.\n At this time, Ms. Lankswert has only work approximately 2 hrs (sitting\nin a breakroom) since the date of her incident. We have requested that TTD\nBenefits be issued & that her attendance status be reinstated as she should\nnot have accrued any Call Ins, used PTO and/or Vacation time in relation to\nher work related injury. The Adjuster just simply states there is suitable\nwork able & denies benefits. We look forward to working with you toward an\namicable resolution and hearing from you shortly.\nW.

Please be aware that Ms. Lankswert has an appointment this afternoon at 2:00p with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. Unfortunately, UPS has delayed the processing this claim & Ms. Lankswert has been advised by her immediate supervisor that they can not accommodate the restrictions set by Concentra, however, she is still required to drive 35+ miles to the property and to sit in a breakroom for the evening. Due to her injuries, Ms. Lankswert was advised to not be driving for long periods & is unable to sit in the provided chairs (Photos provided). Hence, leading Ms. Lankswert to be forced to use vacation time & receive occurrences for her missed time. Please beginning processing her TTD Benefits as soon as possible and advise your client to reinstate Ms. Lankswert's vacation time & Attendance Status as soon as possible to avoid future issues. Ms. Lankswert should not have accrued any occurrences or been punished for her work-related injury. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. We look forward to working with you toward an amicable resolution of this matter.\nSarena M.
