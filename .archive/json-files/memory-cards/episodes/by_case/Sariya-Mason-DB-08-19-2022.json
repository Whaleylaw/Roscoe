The plaintiff's legal team is attempting to schedule depositions for the defendants, who appear to be Spanish-speaking.\nThe most recent activity shows that the plaintiff's attorney, Bryce Koon, sent another email on January 24, 2025, requesting deposition dates for February or March after previous attempts to schedule went unanswered. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the defense's claim that the plaintiff provoked the dog attack, supported by a recorded statement from a witness named Leandry Badia. This contradicts the plaintiff's assertion of an unprovoked attack. (See details)\nThe recommended next step is to follow up on the deposition scheduling request. If there's no response by January 29, 2025, the plaintiff's team plans to file a Motion to Compel. (See details)",
