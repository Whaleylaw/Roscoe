Our truck was a Ford F450 which is nearly 20 feet long and ways over 4 tons and she hit it. How can she be confused about here such a large truck came from before hitting it unless she was not paying attention to where she was going?

Client's depo went pretty poorly as she had a ton of trouble explaining how the collision occurred and changed her story a couple of times, at one point testifying that the vehicle in the damage photos was not the vehicle she collided with - very difficult. However, the Defendant testified that he could not remember anything about the collision (where he was coming from, going to, what street he was on when the wreck occurred). The police report and incident reports by driver and passenger contradict one another. Spoke to DC and said I would be sending over a demand soon. He candidly told me they would likely make a small offer but are not going to accept the appendectomy as related (2 days post-MVA). I told him I would send him over a demand with everything and we can talk numbers in the future.",

Long__\nHi\nHere's the summary of the call with Brenda D. Long at 1/10 11:30 AM\n(UTC-05:00):\nBrenda and Aaron discussed the challenges in proving the appendicitis was\nrelated to the car accident, leading to a recommendation to negotiate a\nsettlement.\nRecap\n * Aaron Whaley informed Brenda that the demand sent for her car accident\ncase has not been accepted due to difficulties in linking her appendicitis\nto the accident.\n * The accident occurred on September 3rd, and Brenda went to the emergency\nroom two days later.\n * Aaron reviewed medical records and found insufficient evidence to prove\nthe appendicitis was caused by the accident, despite the timing.\n * Brenda acknowledged the truck hit her car but expressed frustration over\nthe opposing party's stance.\n * Aaron recommended starting negotiations with the other party, as\npursuing the appendicitis claim would likely be unproductive.\n * Brenda expressed gratitude for Aaron's support during this challenging\ntime, especially after losing her husband.\nTasks\n * Aaron needs to initiate negotiations with the opposing attorney\nregarding the settlement offer.\nBest,\naaron whaley",

Long, who was hit by a truck and subsequently developed appendicitis. The main challenge is proving that the appendicitis was caused by the accident.The most recent activity was a call between Aaron Whaley and Brenda D. Long, where they discussed the difficulties in linking the appendicitis to the accident and the recommendation to negotiate a settlement. (See details)A potential risk is the lack of sufficient evidence to prove the appendicitis was caused by the accident, which may significantly impact the settlement amount. This could lead to a lower settlement than initially anticipated. (See details)The next recommended step is for Aaron Whaley to initiate negotiations with the opposing attorney regarding the settlement offer, focusing on the aspects of the case that can be proven. (See details)",
