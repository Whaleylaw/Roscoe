All records & bills have been requested and we are\nawaiting receipt of those records & bills. Providers have a minimum of 30\ndays to produce these documents.\n I also understand you are wanting policy limits & PIP to be released to\nStarlite. Unfortunately, as I have advised each time, the insurance\ncompanies are not required to disclose policy limits prior to a demand\nbeing submitted. A demand can not be submitted until all medical bills &\nrecords are received, which again, have been requested. I further explained\nto you & to Gail, Aaron typically also awaits the medical bills for review\nbefore releasing PIP payments as he can determine who receives what amount\nof the available benefits. He can not simply release all benefits to a\nsingle provider when you have numerous providers and already $30k just\nbetween 2 of them. I have sent this information over to him to review as\nwell as the statement that a civil suit is being 'following' or 'filed' on\nyour behalf.

While we understand your concern, filing suit\nis not a proper process for your claims at this time. The Bodily Injury\nCarrier for your claims have accepted liability and we are simply awaiting\nyou to complete treatment. Once you have completed treatment and all of\nyour records & bills have been obtained, we will proceed with the proper\nDemand Process. IF during the negotiation phase of the claim, your bodily\ninjury carrier is not willing to make a reasonable offer, your attorney,\nAaron Whaley, will review the file for litigation. Please understand that\nlitigation is a very expensive and lengthy process and should not be taken\nlightly, at this time, we will not be filing a civil suit. If you have any\nother questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss\nthem in further detail.\nSarena M.

He does not complain of back injury when I hit him, but does after Gail smacks him. Gail's insurance will say his back injury is due to my assault not Gail's regardless of when he complained of back pain) \n__Person Making Contact:__ Sarena\n__Date & Time__: December 19 2024",

Aaron will discuss the $3,500 settlement offer with client\n2. Review treatment records to address Progressive's concerns about pre-existing treatment\n3. If filing legal action, send courtesy notice to Natasha Fortune\n\nClaim #22-8451213 | Demand: $50,000 (policy limits) | Medical Bills: $17,440.56",
