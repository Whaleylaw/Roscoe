We had to hire out the input of waterline because with Mike?s injury to his back he was unable to put the waterline in himself. The cost of the waterline was $10,800. Mikes was hoping that his back injury would be healed so we could put the fence in but as of today, October 6, 2023 he is still hurting. With the fence unable to be constructed we had to purchase additional hay to feed our cattle. The field that was unable to be fenced produces approximately 500 rolls worth of feed for cattle. With the drought we only could secure 463 bales of hay at $55 a bale totaling $25,465 to offset the cattle unable to graze on the unfenced field due to the injury caused by the accident on May 19,2023. This does not take into account all the additional projects and maintenance that need to be done on the farm that we are unable to do due to Mike?s injury. We are self-employed farmers on top of the loss of wages, the amount of stress and mental anguish this has caused is staggering.\nSincerely\nMary Jane & Michael Crader\nSent from my iPad",

We had to hire out the input of waterline because with Mike?s injury to his back he was unable to put the waterline in himself. The cost of the waterline was $10,800. Mikes was hoping that his back injury would be healed so we could put the fence in but as of today, October 6, 2023 he is still hurting. With the fence unable to be constructed we had to purchase additional hay to feed our cattle. The field that was unable to be fenced produces approximately 500 rolls worth of feed for cattle. With the drought we only could secure 463 bales of hay at $55 a bale totaling $25,465 to offset the cattle unable to graze on the unfenced field due to the injury caused by the accident on May 19,2023. This does not take into account all the additional projects and maintenance that need to be done on the farm that we are unable to do due to Mike?s injury. We are self-employed farmers on top of the loss of wages, the amount of stress and mental anguish this has caused is staggering.\nSincerely\nMary Jane & Michael Crader\n__Person Making Contact:__ Justin\n__Date & Time__: October 06 2023",

This particular question is directly related to your lost income, not additionally incurred expenses. As far as your Taxes, your Taxes are directly related to your income. As a self-employed individual/business owner, your Taxes are your statement of income to the government and are used to determine and verify your claim of 'Lost Wages', any diminished capacity to earn as well as any lost revenue from your farm. However, I will note your questions to Aaron & Bryce for further explanation if needed. \n__Person Making Contact:__ Sarena\n__Date & Time__: December 23 2024",

Not reimbursed. \nMy wife hasn\u2019t been able to go out and work because now she has to do a lot of the work that I was supposed to be able to do on the farm so that is lost wages. \n\nTaxes for the last 5 years ? Why do they need our taxes. That doesn\u2019t make sense and don\u2019t want them to know what money I have. I don\u2019t want them to come after us, knowing them amount of money we have.\n\nReplied to Client:\nGood morning Michael,\n While yes the things you listed are 'Special Damages', they do not necessarily fall under the 'Lost Wage' category. This particular question is directly related to your lost income, not additionally incurred expenses. As far as your Taxes, your Taxes are directly related to your income. As a self-employed individual/business owner, your Taxes are your statement of income to the government and are used to determine and verify your claim of 'Lost Wages', any diminished capacity to earn as well as any lost revenue from your farm. However, I will note your questions to Aaron & Bryce for further explanation if needed.",

The case is currently in litigation against Megan Combs, with the VA asserting a claim of $86,505.91 for medical treatment provided to Crader.\nThe most recent activity shows that Plaintiff's Discovery Responses were sent to defense counsel on 12/30/2024, along with a notice filed with the court. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the VA's sizeable claim of $86,505.91, which may significantly impact any potential settlement. The case is also still in the discovery phase, indicating it may be some time before a resolution is reached. (See details)\nThe next steps should include following up on the request for an updated itemized ledger from the VA to review the relatedness of the claimed medical expenses, and preparing for the oral discovery phase of litigation.
