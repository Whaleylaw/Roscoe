Based upon our previous discussions, it appears your client's last treatment was December 16, 2021. Please advise if she does continue any fall-related treatment.\nNext, as you had previously advised that your client was making a claim for impairment of her ability to earn money in the future, we will need her tax returns as requested in discovery. We are missing returns for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020. Please provide those to me as soon as possible.\nLastly, once you have had an opportunity to review the new deadlines, give me a call to let me know what your thoughts are with regard to setting the case for mediation.\nThank you,\nBetsy R. Catron\nASSOCIATE ATTORNEY\n[WHT_EmailLogo]\nVine Center\n333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100\nLexington, KY 40507\nP 859.422.6000\nF 859.422.6001\nwww.whtlaw.com",

Based upon our previous discussions, it appears your client's last treatment was December 16, 2021. Please advise if she does continue any fall-related treatment.\nNext, as you had previously advised that your client was making a claim for impairment of her ability to earn money in the future, we will need her tax returns as requested in discovery. We are missing returns for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020. Please provide those to me as soon as possible.\nLastly, once you have had an opportunity to review the new deadlines, give me a call to let me know what your thoughts are with regard to setting the case for mediation.\nThank you,\nBetsy R.

We requested records and bills from Ms. Mills' Norton providers as it was our understanding that she underwent an MRI at the end of May. None of those providers have any records for recent treatment for her. We are still waiting on her records and bills from Baptist Health Corbin. We will provide copies of those to you upon receipt. Please advise if there is any other recent medical treatment of Ms. Mills.\nFurther, you had previously advised of a FCE occurring in late July. Did this occur as planned? What are your thoughts on when you will be able to get us a demand?\nWe have also requested your client's tax returns for 2016, 2018 and 2020 several times. The lack of this information significantly limits our ability to evaluate her future earning impairment claim. We also need to know the last day that Bella Beauty was in business.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss the above in further detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nThank you,\nBetsy R.

Sedentary work is basically low level physical work that involves\nmostly sitting, some walking/standing on occasions and nothing that\nrequires lifting over 10lbs. The report acknowledges that while you are\nlimited in the work you do, you are able to perform jobs that are not\nphysical in nature, examples would be a desk job or running your business\n(handline paperwork) while employees actually perform the services.\n Aaron has set up an evaluation with an economist to help determine the\nfinancial impact these restrictions will have. Once we hear from the\neconomist, we will update you in further detail.\n However, we are still awaiting your tax documents from 2016 & 2017 as\nwell as the official date that Bella Beauty closed its doors. We understand\nthat your equipment and products are still in your location and you still\nhave possession of the location, however, we need the date of the last\nservices performed. We also understand your concern with providing all this\nfinancial information but as we explained it is required in order to\ndetermine the proper amount of compensation you should receive.\n If you do not have the tax documents in your possession, please reach\nout to the IRS and/or your tax preparer and obtain copies as soon as\npossible. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us.\nSarena M.

We requested records and bills from Ms. Mills\u2019 Norton providers as it was our understanding that she underwent an MRI at the end of May. None of those providers have any records for recent treatment for her. We are still waiting on her records and bills from Baptist Health Corbin. We will provide copies of those to you upon receipt. Please advise if there is any other recent medical treatment of Ms. Mills.\nFurther, you had previously advised of a FCE occurring in late July. Did this occur as planned? What are your thoughts on when you will be able to get us a demand?\nWe have also requested your client\u2019s tax returns for 2016, 2018 and 2020 several times. The lack of this information significantly limits our ability to evaluate her future earning impairment claim. We also need to know the last day that Bella Beauty was in business.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss the above in further detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nThank you,\nBetsy R.

Your skills as a counselor instead of\nbeautician/cosmetologist.\nPlease send the requested information as soon as possible, we understand\nthat it may take you a day or two to gather everything together.

After which my child\nneeded me to write a school excuse where he was out sick and to sign a\npermission slip - AND I COULDN\u2019T EVEN DO THAT! I had to get someone else to\nwrite it and sign my name bc I couldn\u2019t even hold the pen (bc I\u2019m left\nhanded) from complete numbness, sharp electric Zapps, muscle spasms, just\nfrom doing this one task that I attached that took hours/all afternoon!\nThe frustration comes from these types of unspoken struggles that should\nnot be happening! And yes all this is from this accident! And at first\nglance when looking at me you wouldn\u2019t think anything but unless you are\nwith me every second of the day I can\u2019t get anyone to understand and I try\nto hide it because I\u2019m so sick of people simply asking 24/7 - \u201care you\nokay?\u201d\nOr hot always have multiple doctors looking at the exact same scans\n(without my report or input! Just scans and test results) and all give a\ndifferent and sometimes conflicting report of diagnosis! How is someone\nsuppose to get the correct treatment if non of the doctors and specialists\ncan agree on the same pictures!\n4 years of this and everything that comes from cause and effect\u2026. I wish it\nhad never ever happened!!!! It is beyond frustrating\nThank you for viewing this I just wanted to let you know as a way of maybe\nletting you see some insight. Something that shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to\ndo/type and it was such an ordeal that causes mental stress, physical\nstress, and pressure on me and my family! Yes, this is absolutely INSANE\nbut my reality I continue to work with everyday.\nI feel I needed to send you this as clarification I suppose even though\nit\u2019s hard to even talk about and acknowledge out loud.\n(I will send the completed document, I\u2019m going to have someone to help me\nput this together as soon as possible)\nThank you,\nAmy Mills\nOn Wed, May 3, 2023 at 3:11 PM Sarena Tuttle\nwrote:\n> Awesome, thank you so much.\n> Again, I apologize for the frustration and confusion.\n>\n> Sarena M.

I understand that you are human and\nare suffering from so much more than just a physical injury. This was a\nlife changing event that will have a lasting effect not only physically but\nalso mentally, emotionally, financially & spiritually. We are not trying to\nmake this more difficult than it has to be, if we were able to get this\ninformation any other way we would. We understand that completing task can\nhave varying difficulties and try to give you as much time to complete them\nas the court will allow. We know that you would like to get this matter\nresolved and be able to move forward without all these reminders of what\nhappened. Unfortunately, in order to resolve the matter and make sure we\nare able to get you everything we can, we have to ask for information.\nCurrently, the Defense is asking for this employment history and we can not\nmove forward until we receive it, however, we understand that it may take\nyou a couple of days to gather the information.

As we have\ndiscussed, your mediation will take place on September 21, 2023 at 9:00a.m.\nEastern Time.\n This will be your opportunity to discuss your claim with a former\ncircuit court judge and the Defense Counsel. The Mediator will review a\nsummary of the evidence, listen to both sides and their current position.\nHe will then provide insight into how he feels the claim should be\nresolved. His opinions are not final and simply a tool to help with\ndeciding whether to move forward with trial or to attempt settlement.\n If the Defense is willing, you may possibly settle your claim if a\nmutual agreement is reached. If not, the claim will move forward to Trial.\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us to discuss\nthem in further detail.\nTime: Sep 21, 2023 09:00 AM Eastern Time (US and Canada)\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/9650447148\nMeeting ID: 965 044 7148\nPasscode: 54321\nSarena M.

I need this done so that I can send this\nto an expert and we can see if you need to have a revision surgery done and\nwe can see if possibly your neck is what\u2019s causing your headaches. If we\ncan rule out the neck for your headaches then you can move on to treatment\nfor the headaches, and again the experts, can offer an opinion. We need to\ndo this if we\u2019re going to get to the numbers that you want in this case.\nAlso, at this point, the longer we wait the worse it becomes if we are at\ntrial.

Client slipped and\nfell on a marble floor at a bank. She was in her late 30's at the time.\nSince the fall in 2019 she has had a cervical fusion, shoulder labral\nrepair, migraine headaches and still has shoulder/neck pain. Current\ntreaters at Bluegrass Ortho have gone back and forth between whether it is\nher shoulder or neck. I have records as well as timelines I have created.

I have a case that I need some work on. I am thinking I need a narrative of what injuries are related to a fall as well as an IME. Probably need a life plan from there. Client slipped and fell on a marble floor at a bank. She was in her late 30's at the time. Since the fall in 2019 she has had a cervical fusion, shoulder labral repair, migraine headaches and still has shoulder/neck pain. Current treaters at Bluegrass Ortho have gone back and forth between whether it is her shoulder or neck. I have records as well as timelines I have created.

The plaintiff has ongoing medical issues and treatments related to the incident, including shoulder problems requiring surgery.\nThe most recent activity shows that the defendant filed a Motion for Contempt and to Impose Sanctions on January 7, 2025, which was scheduled for a hearing on January 13, 2025. (See details)\nA potential red flag is that the plaintiff's discovery responses were deemed deficient by the defense, particularly regarding the disclosure of new medical providers and upcoming surgery information. This led to the Motion for Contempt. (See details)\nThe next steps should include gathering and providing updated medical information, particularly about Dr. Kevin Magone in London, KY, who is treating the plaintiff, and details about the postponed January 3rd surgery. This information should be promptly shared with the defense to address the discovery issues. (See details), (See details)",

Please sign the enclosed HIPAA authorization and return it to us in the enclosed self-addressed stamped envelope. We also need to set up a time to talk about your case, a second mediation, an independent medical examination, and other steps that need to be taken to keep your case moving forward. Please respond to the e-mail chain with some dates and times that you would be available to talk. As I stated in a recent e-mail, I will be in town for an inspection of the bank on Wednesday October 29, 2025. If you would like to meet before or after that inspection that would be fantastic.\nCordially by me\nEnclosures: HIPAA authorization\n\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082\u00e2\u0080\u0082Self-addressed stamped envelop\nG.
