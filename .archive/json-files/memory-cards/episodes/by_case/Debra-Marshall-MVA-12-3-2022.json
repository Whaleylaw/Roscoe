Please let her know that there will be no additional updates until approximately 30 days after her deposition. Once the depositions are complete, both attorneys will review the information and decide if additional discovery is required. If so, Discovery will resume and will take an additional 60 days. If not, they will discuss the possibility of settlement again. It is possible that they may decide to schedule a mediation, however, none of this will happen prior to April 3, 2025. If she has any specific questions, she is welcome to give us a call to discuss them in further detail. Please let her know, she needs to be contact Bryce or myself, as she keeps leaving voicemails for Justin, who is no longer her case manager. I can be reached at Ext 104 and Bryce can be reached at Ext 114. -Sarena, The Whaley Law Firm",
