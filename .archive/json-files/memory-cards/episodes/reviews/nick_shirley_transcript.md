Hello. We'd like to ask where the   money's going.   >> What do you guys think about the fraud   that's taking place here in Minnesota?   >> Sorry.   >> I don't think anybody is enabling fraud   to happen.   >> Hold Governor RS accountable for this.   >> What was this money spent on?   >> 1.26 million.


00:00:14 - 00:00:40
 What was that money spent?   >> There aren't any kids.   >> Answer the question. Are there children?   >> There's no children inside this   building. Potentially the largest fraud   scandal in US history is taking place in   Minnesota as literally billions of   dollars have been funneled through   Somali ran fraudulent businesses. So   much fraud it could actually almost   replace the entire GDP of Somalia.


00:00:35 - 00:01:01
 These   fraudsters have worked handinhand with   the Minnesota government as they enabled   billions of ollars to be given to   fraudulent businesses underneath welfare   purposes. Some of this money eventually   landed in the hands of terrorist groups   in Somalia like the al-Shabaab and   others enriched themselves all at the US   taxpayers expense.


00:00:56 - 00:01:15
 And in this video, we   will break down all of the fraud from   start to finish from going to the   fraudulent businesses and confronting   the people who are making millions of   dollars from the government. And we will   also be confronting the incompetent   government leaders who let this fraud   happen.


00:01:12 - 00:01:38
 And to make this happen, I met   up with a man who's been doing his own   investigation for years now as he has   seen the fraud firsthand. His name is   David. Let's get into this and be   prepared to be shocked. How deep is this   fraud here inside of Minnesota?   >> It is far worse than anybody can   imagine. You heard it's 7 to 10 billion   and maybe more.
**We're first introduced here to David—no last name, no qualifications, just that he's apparently someone we should trust for no reason.*

00:01:34 - 00:01:54
 And now the numbers have   been revised and put out there publicly   that they think it's more like 8   billion. How I got involved is that   where my office is here in Minneapolis,   I'm sort of in the heart of all of this   fraud and I would see these child care   centers. I said, "Well, there aren't any   kids there.


00:01:51 - 00:02:13
 It's the middle of the day   and all I see are a couple of guys   standing out front smoking." And then   I'd go by another daycare and I'd see   the same thing. I said, "Well,   where do these kids play?" And so I   started to go online and look and I   said, "This place is licensed for 80   children. They had zero children. Every   time I went by there, they never had a   single child there.


00:02:09 - 00:02:35
" Then I started to   see all these transportation companies   going around and it was always a Somali   driver. And I said, "Well, that's great.   They're out there transportation   contributing, but they never had a   passenger. Never ever once." And I said,   "Well, what is all this transportation?   What are they doing?" So then I found   out that in Minnesota they have   something called non-emergency medical   transportation.
**We have this in Kentucky, too.*

00:02:34 - 00:02:58
  So this is going to the dentist's   office, therapy, whatever it might be.   And I said, 'Well, how many of these   companies are there? And the research   came back that there are a,020 of them,   and more than 800 of them are Somali   owned. Nobody from the state of   Minnesota ever cross checks to see if   any rides were ever actually provided.
**So we have a blanket assertion that nobody checks, nobody knows, they're just cutting checks to them. Thanks David.*

00:02:56 - 00:03:20
  All they did was write the check.   >> So, right here, we have all this   paperwork. And how are you getting all   this information about the fraud? A lot   of it is is through my own research and   then I have some contacts at the capital   going back many many years. And so the   data that I'm getting is 100% accurate   coming directly from research done by   people at the state capital.
**So now we start to see documents, but it's from his own research and contacts.But he assures us that it's 100% accurate.*

00:03:18 - 00:03:54
  >> All this paperwork right here, what are   we looking at?   >> The areas of fraud that   I have numbers for are mostly related to   child care. This is massive fraud that   is beyond anyone's imagination the   scope. And so for example, there's a   child care not far from here in   Minneapolis that has two day two childc   carees listed at the same address and   together they're licensed supposedly for   120 children.
**We're shown a cutout of a piece of paper that looks like a print off from the Secretary of State website or something.And then the assertion that they're licensed for 120 children, but no explanation of what that means. Like, does that mean that they have 120 kids there? And no, nothing.And again, just David's assurance that there's never kids there.*

00:03:48 - 00:04:16
 I have never seen a single   child there ever. And I've been by that   place at least a hundred times. These   Somalians, these groups are setting up   these daycarees, these childcare   centers, getting money from the   government, but there's no kids.   >> No kids. Never had any of them. They're   all fraught with violations. And even   though they have these violations,   they're still in operation and they're   still getting money.


00:04:12 - 00:04:36
 And it's millions   of dollars for every one of them every   year.   >> And who's getting the money and where   are they getting the money from?   >> So, we have a thing called CCAP. It's a   blend of federal and state money. The   bottom line is it's taxpayer money, so   it's state money and it's federal money.   And the problem is the people of the   state of Minnesota are the ones writing   the checks.


00:04:31 - 00:05:00
 This is kind of the   maddening thing is you have daycare, so   you have adult daycare, and then you   have child care, and then you have   health care, and a lot of these same   names keep coming up on all of these   different types of businesses. And then,   of course, we have the transportation.   And a lot of those same names appear, a   lot of the same addresses.


00:04:52 - 00:05:20
 There's one   building that has 14 Somali healthcare   companies at the same address. There's   another building in St. Paul that has 22   Somali healthc care businesses at the   same address.   >> And the government knows about this.   >> The government knows they're writing the   checks. Yeah, the Democrats over there   writing just writing the checks.


00:05:16 - 00:05:42
 What   has happened is that the Somali   community is a very closed community.   They will not speak to anyone outside   the community and talk about what's   going on within the community. They vote   as a block. And so when you're a   politician, you're saying, "Look, I've   got 100,000 people in Minnesota that if   I do something for the community,   they're going to vote for me.


00:05:38 - 00:05:59
" And   that's what it's all about is getting   the votes. And then the people here in   Minnesota, you hear this term Minnesota   nice. I'm so sick of that term. The   people here are so afraid of being   called a racist or an Islamophobe   and they're just they're afraid of their   own shadow.


00:05:55 - 00:06:25
 And I don't understand this   is our our future generations are going   to have to pay for all this fraud and   they just want to bury their heads in   the sand and go on and just not worry   about it. Tim Walls saying there's   organized crime in Minnesota. What did   he do about it? Nothing. You got   organized crime? What are you What are   you doing? This is the Minnesota law   which mandates that anyone who knows of   fraud and is a state employee must   report that fraud.


00:06:20 - 00:06:46
 It's Minnesota   statute 3.971   subdivision 9. Not only that, but Walls   is also guilty of misconduct of a public   employee. When I look at the world as   whole and I look at fraud,   the Twin Cities is ground zero. The   fraud is worse here than anywhere else   ever in history anywhere.   >> We're going to go confront these people.
**Here's where he shows us his printout of a statute Of some criminal code from Minnesota that he then alleges that Governor Walz is guilty of.*

00:06:45 - 00:07:04
  We're going to go to these daycare   centers. We're going to see what what's   actually happening.   >> Okay. So, we have to be careful because   these people are very violent. They're   exceptionally violent.   >> Now, with all of David's evidence, we   headed out to the streets of Minneapolis   to see how much fraud we could uncover   in one afternoon.


00:06:59 - 00:07:27
 Where are we going   now? We're going to a place called Mako   Child Care which actually has another   child care registered at the same   address called Mini Child Care Center.   >> So we should see lots of children if   there's a this uh childcare center   especially if there's two.   >> The two of them combined are licensed   for 120   >> and how much money have these childcare   centers received.


00:07:25 - 00:07:57
  >> None of those vans have moved in 6   months. None of them. In 2020, one of   them received 1.3 million. In 2021, they   got 987,000.   In 2022, they got 714,000.   That's the last I have for that one. And   then the other one, 1.604   million in fiscal year 2025.   Fiscal year 2024, they got about   800,000.
**We get David's naked assertion that none of these vans have moved for six months. And then a graphic of looks like something he typed up. Money stolen from Minnesota.*

00:07:51 - 00:08:20
 And in 20 fiscal year 2023,   they got $94,59.   This place right here.   >> Yes.   >> Outside of it.   >> Well, this is actually two daycarees are   registered here. One of them is Mako,   which you see on this sign. The other   one is Mini Child Care Center. And   between the two of these childc care   centers, they're pulling in about $3   million a year   and there are no children.


00:08:16 - 00:08:41
 Every   facility that you go to, the windows   will be blocked out so you can't see in.   There's nobody here. You won't see a   single child at any of these facilities.   >> There are indeed no windows. All the   windows are blacked out right here. All   right, let's go in.   >> And the childcare center is locked.   Should we ring the doorbell?   >> Yeah.
**So they're outside a daycare, windows are blocked out, which again, it's a children's daycare. We don't need weirdos looking inside the windows. Doors locked. Which, in today's world, yeah, I would expect it to be locked every school I go to when I try to go in is locked. Don't see why a child daycare would be any different. They didn't answer the door according to them, and they are concluding that there's nobody there, but they've provided no proof. We just have their assertion that it's a day that it's open first and that there's no one there.*

00:08:39 - 00:08:56
  >> Try to get in. Rang the doorbell. Nobody   showed up. They're open 7 days a week,   7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. it says here on   their sign. Yet, there's absolutely   nobody here. And this building here,   right here, has generated millions of   dollars. And it seems like business   isn't even open right now.


00:08:55 - 00:09:18
 And it's a   weekday.   >> And if this was a daycare center, it   wouldn't just be in some industrialized   building. There would be maybe like a   playground or something outside or   there's no play area for the kids.   So where are the kids? Where's anybody?   How can there be nobody here? And it's   like this every single day.
**There is no play area, so it must be a fraud.*

00:09:10 - 00:09:35
 I've never   seen a single child here in nine years.   I've never seen a single child at this   building right there.   >> Oh, then now it looks like we already   got the Somali coming through.   >> Yeah, they're coming. The word's out.   >> Hello. Is this your daycare?   >> No. Can you tell us why there are no   children? Have you ever seen children at   this child care center?   >> I'm not sure.
**So they ask a lady, and she brushes him off and doesn't want to talk to him. They conclude there must not be any kids.*

00:09:32 - 00:09:54
 I don't   >> Doesn't know if she's ever seen a child   here. All right, let's go to the next   location. And the fraud only gets more   from here. Make sure you stay till the   very end of this video to see exactly   how much fraud we find by the time we   are done. And before we go to the next   location, I want to show you something   super interesting about the flags of   Minnesota.


00:09:50 - 00:10:10
 And here in Minnesota, if you   take a look at the Minnesota state flag,   they recently changed it and it very   much so resembles the flag of Somalia.   And really quick, I want to tell you   guys about the sponsor of this video,   Opus Clip. What used to just be an AI   clipper has now become the most powerful   AI growth tool for creators.


00:10:05 - 00:10:33
 Right now,   over 10 million creators and businesses   have used Opus Clip to help them gain   over 60 billion views. I've used Opus   and I've even had my friends use it and   it helped my one friend with nearly just   a 100 followers get a video up to 30,000   views. And it's super simple to use. All   you do is you upload video or copy a   YouTube link and Opus will do the rest   and it'll come out with tons of viral   shorts for you then to choose from.


00:10:29 - 00:10:52
 And   Opus just came out their new AI editor   3.0 that comes with smarter autoframing,   better virality scoring, and new   captions. And I've said it before, but   Opus is so simple that even my mom can   use it. And if I can use it, I know you   can use it.   >> And right now for you guys watching this   video, Opus is going to hook you guys up   with a sweet deal.

One week free and 3 months at   50% off. And now let's get back into the   video. Now we're going to the next   daycare center.


00:11:04 - 00:11:37
 How much money has this   one generated? This one in fiscal year   20251,42,59   in fiscal year 2024 1,59,78.   And in fiscal year 2023, $727,336.   >> This next one is literally one block   away. And this one's also generated   nearly $3 million in the past 3 years.   Let's see if there's any children. Let's   see if any of the buildings are open.


00:11:35 - 00:12:02
  Here we go. All right, we've arrived to   ABC Learning Center.   All the windows are blacked out. Let's   see if anybody is here.   This door is locked.   >> This facility is licensed for 40   children.   Zero children. I've come by this place a   100 times. I've never seen a child here   ever.
**Another locked door, which again, sure.It's a school.And another bald assertion that there's no kids there.*

00:11:58 - 00:12:23
 The only thing I've ever seen is   someone standing outside smoking. What's   crazy about this is that last daycare   center is that green building right   there and the other daycare center right   now is right here. These buildings   should be operating as are receiving   literally millions of dollars.   >> I knocked on the door and to my   surprise, somebody actually answered the   door. Hello.


00:12:22 - 00:12:43
  >> Can we speak?   >> Yeah.   >> I would like to check a child in the   daycare. Why   >> can I speak to a manager?   Where can I get paperwork to file for my   son? I wanted to put my son Joey in   daycare. And after a few questions, the   lady went silent. Looks like little Joey   surely ain't going to daycare here.
**Yeah, he tries to check his kid in there, but it's him. He's filming and it's clearly my no. I wouldn't answer the name door to him either.*

00:12:40 - 00:13:05
 And   now where are we going   >> now? We're going to Sweet Angel Child   Care.   >> We're in the middle of a strip mall here   inside of this neighborhood.   >> In fiscal year 2025,   this facility, which says it's licensed   for 74 kids, was paid $1.26 26 million   in tax money and there are no kids and   the all the facilities are the same way.


00:13:05 - 00:13:27
  All of them.   >> Let's see if anyone opens.   >> Yeah. Let's see.   >> Once again, I try to find a spot for my   son Joey and they would not open the   door.   >> I want to put my son Joey in daycare   >> cuz I need a spot to put my son Joey.   >> Yes.   >> Is this your daycare center?   >> No, I work there.


00:13:23 - 00:13:47
 What's happen? I just   want to put a child in daycare, but all   the daycare centers be seem to be   closed.   >> No one's opening the doors.   >> You work here?   >> I was. Yeah. What's happening?   >> Where are the kids?   >> Yeah. It says it's licensed for 74   children right here. State of Minnesota.   Where are the kids?   >> They got paid $1.


00:13:42 - 00:14:03
26 million in fiscal   year 2025. It says that have a capacity   for 74 children. Where? When? When?   >> Where are the kids? Right here. State of   Minnesota website.   You work here and you don't know?   >> I don't know. I was there before. I   don't know what's going on.   >> Were there any kids when you worked   here?   >> He's there. Kids there.
**Now they grill an employee, again, no evidence.*

00:14:01 - 00:14:17
 What's   >> How many?   >> I don't know. I don't know.   >> You don't know?   >> Yeah.   >> You worked here? Okay. Well, then you're   not of any help.   >> Can I put my son in a daycare here?   >> No. No. I don't know.   >> Can I speak to someone?   >> No, I don't know.   >> No. Yeah. I would like to see if I can   put my son Joey here.


00:14:16 - 00:14:32
  >> Who's your son Joey?   >> My son Joey? Can I check out daycare   center?   >> No, you don't know my son?   >> No.   I'm the owner. Do you do you put your   kid here in the daycare? I   >> don't know.   >> There is one child in there. Yeah. I   would like to know if this is a legit   business.   >> Me? I'm scared you too.


00:14:29 - 00:14:50
 How come I   explain everything?   >> You're scared of me?   >> Yeah. Because of your courage.   >> Cuz of my color. You said you're scared   of me because of my color. Does that   make you a racist?   >> Yeah. No. You said you're You said   you're scared of me because of my color.   >> I'm not saying you're racist.   >> You You said you're scared of me because   of my color. That makes you a racist.


00:14:46 - 00:15:08
 So   right now they're all getting mad cuz   he's shown the paperwork of this   business being registered as a business.   74 children, no children. We saw one   child when the lady opened up the door.   >> So now they're all getting mad. What was   this money spent on?   >> 1.26 million. What was that money spent   on the   >> There aren't any kids.


00:15:07 - 00:15:37
  >> Ask the owner and the kids.   >> Well, then why are you talking for the   owner if you're telling me to talk to   the owner?   >> I'm sorry. I'm not understand what   you're talking about.   >> Do you have a child here?   >> No. Does anybody know?   >> Where are the 74 kids? Did you lose   them? Did you lose these kids? Do I need   to call someone? Do I need to issue an   Amber Alert for missing children?   >> Are these children missing?   >> It's not my business that children are   missing.


00:15:33 - 00:16:01
 74 infants and toddlers   preschool.   >> The proof right there. There's no   children anywhere from the state of   Minnesota right here.   We're moving on to the next location.   >> Have a good day.   >> As we continue to show the blatant fraud   that was taking place here in Minnesota,   Somali started following us around the   city.


00:15:58 - 00:16:21
 And now we're being followed by   the Somali. This is another daycare   center. Absolutely no signage. And   there's no footprints in the snow of   children playing outside.   $5 million within the past.   >> 59 million in two years. 5.9 million   they received in 2 years. That facility   right there.   >> And now we have a group of Somali   telling us in our vehicle right now.


00:16:19 - 00:16:43
  From this daycare center, we headed over   to the infamous Quality Learning Center,   which actually spells quality learing   center on the outside of their sign.   That's how blatant this fraud is here at   this daycare.   >> Don't open up.   >> So this is quality   learing center. I meant to say quality   learning center. Don't open up.


00:16:40 - 00:17:00
  >> They said they spelled learning wrong.   >> Don't open up.   >> How do you have ICE here, ma'am? I'm   literally a YouTuber.   >> Don't open up.   >> Ma'am, what do you think about the fraud   that's taking place here in Minnesota?   >> Don't open up. We have ICE,   >> ma'am. What do you think about this   place being licensed for 99 children?   >> Don't open up.


00:16:58 - 00:17:26
  >> And getting $4 million over the   >> Don't open up. It's ice.   >> $4 million in the last two years.   >> Go away.   >> What do you think about that? Are you in   favor? Are you in favor of that?   >> Go away. You're not welcome here. Shame   on you.   >> Are you in favor of   >> $1.9 million going illegally?   >> Don't open up   >> fraudulently to this business that has   quality learning center but can't even   spell learning right on the door.


00:17:23 - 00:17:46
  >> Don't open up.   >> Ma'am, we are not ICE.   >> I don't care who you are. You don't   belong here.   >> I belong here just like you belong here.   >> Don't open up. It's ICE. You do realize   that there's supposed to be 99 children   at here at this building, but there's no   one here.   >> This is a child daycare center.


00:17:42 - 00:18:03
  >> This is 99 children paid $1.9 million   this year in CCAP funding. Do you know   where the children are? Were they   kidnapped? They run away. Where are the   children? This is state of Minnesota   right here.   >> And who are you?   >> My name's Nick Shirley, ma'am.   >> And who are you with?   >> Nick Shirley. Nick Shirley on YouTube.


00:18:01 - 00:18:17
  >> Yeah. So, who are you with here? Oh,   he's just been doing some research   investigating the fraud that's taking   place here in Minnesota.   >> Yeah, I'm with Nick Shirley.   >> This lady, she's calling us ICE. We're   just trying to put law and order back in   the streets of the United States.   >> Get rid of all the fraud.


00:18:14 - 00:18:31
 Have you ever   seen children at that daycare center   right there?   >> What?   >> Yeah, it's right there. It says the   child. You've never seen day.   >> I don't see anybody here.   >> We're going to educate you on something.   So, what do you think about this daycare   center? They spelled learning wrong.   They've received over $1.


00:18:26 - 00:18:50
9 million this   year alone and they're supposed to have   99 children here. I don't see it.   >> Children.   >> Have you ever seen any children here?   >> None. None at all.   >> None.   >> Last This year they got 1.9 million.   Last year they got 1.5 million of your   tax money for 99 children. We just want   to know where are the kids,   >> right?   >> Where are the children?   >> I don't see them.


00:18:46 - 00:19:04
 I've been here since   2017. I haven't seen anybody like that.   >> Never seen a child here.   >> Nope. Not at all.   >> And so you've never seen a child here   for 8 years?   >> Nope. Not at all.   >> And how does that make you feel knowing   that this place is receiving $1.9   million?   >> Disgusting. I mean, what the hell? They   stealing the money.


00:19:02 - 00:19:23
 That's a federal   grant, too. That's, you know, if they   get caught for that's a federal offense.   I know. I said he'd lie.   >> And do you think Tim Waltz should go to   jail for all the fraud that he's enabled   here in his state?   >> That's him doing this. Heck yeah. He's   got to be held accountable for this. I   mean, there's no there's no rhyme or   reason what's going on here.


00:19:19 - 00:19:48
 It's   simple. It's nothing there. It's parking   lot.   >> And look, they even spelled learning   wrong on their sign for a place that's   supposed to be educating children. Child   children.   Yeah, that's crazy. I mean, who who runs   it? Who supposedly runs it?   >> Somalians.   >> Oh my god.   Oh my god.   Well, what where? Yeah, it's just I've   never seen nobody here at all.


00:19:46 - 00:20:05
  >> So, how long you been living here?   >> Since 2017.   >> I've never seen a single child walk in   that building.   >> No, not at all.   >> So, this daycare center is literally   just a place to traffic money. $1.9   million just this year alone. And this   guy's been living here for eight years   and has never seen a single child walk   through those doors.


00:20:03 - 00:20:28
 There's no windows   either.   >> No.   >> And the only window they do have, the   door is blacked out.   >> Yep. I see that.   >> I've never seen anybody go in there.   >> Within just a few hours, we nearly   approached $20 million in fraud. And we   headed over to George Floyd's   neighborhood to expose more of the fraud   taking place.


00:20:22 - 00:21:05
 This place is called   Future Leaders Early Learning Center and   it's licensed for 90 children. And in   fiscal year 2025, they received $3.6   million. In fiscal year 2024,   they received $3 million. So in two   years, they got $6.67   million   claiming they have 90 children every day   of the week, five days a week. People   are making just about more money than   NBA athletes   >> and we don't even know if they're paying   taxes, but we don't know where this   money is going.


00:21:00 - 00:21:30
 Is it is it going to   terrorism? Is it where is it going? But   it's it's theft. It's fraud. And the   reason I'm involved is I want it to   stop. I care about Minnesota. I'm doing   this for the people of Minnesota. I   don't make a dime off all this time I've   spent on this. I put my life at risk.   several times, but I'm determined to see   this through and to correct what is   wrong, what is evil.


00:21:28 - 00:21:54
  >> Here at Future Leaders Early Learning   Center, this building received 3   million, over $3 million. Hello. How are   you? Good.   >> I would like to see if I could bring   little Joey, my son, little Joey, here.   Is there a paperwork or can I check out   the daycare?   >> No.   >> No.   >> Why can't I check out the daycare?   is not here.


00:21:52 - 00:22:18
  >> Okay. But if I can I get paperwork or   anything to submit my son little Joey to   come in here to daycare.   >> We'd really like to put Joey in this   daycare. We've heard great things.   >> Business card?   >> No, I would like your business card.   Actually,   >> you talk to your manager.   >> Okay.


00:22:14 - 00:22:40
 Can I speak with somebody?   Where where are the children at?   Are there children here today?   >> No.   >> No children?   >> Yes.   >> Why are there no children?   >> Uh, two of Mexico's coming.   >> Would my son little Joey have friends to   play with here?   >> No.   >> No.   >> Yes.   >> No. No friends for little Joey.   >> Yes. Sorry.   >> Dang it.


00:22:38 - 00:23:01
 Well, have a great rest of your   day.   >> Thank you.   >> So, little Joey would not be accepted to   that daycare.   >> Joy's still homeless.   >> Joey's still looking for daycare. And   because little Joey couldn't get into a   daycare, we went to an autism center as   they have been popping up everywhere as   a rise of autism has occurred here in   Minnesota because of the government   funds that they are receiving.


00:22:57 - 00:23:22
 I tried   to check my son Joey into an autism   center. We've been going to a lot of   these daycare centers. We're trying to   find a spot for our little boy Joey,   >> but uh we thought maybe we could check   him into the autism center   >> cuz none of the daycare centers are   open. Yeah. And how many kids do you   guys have at this autism center? Um   about   >> I can't give you a number now.


00:23:21 - 00:23:39
  >> Like more than five?   >> Probably.   >> Probably. So, you don't really know.   >> Yeah.   >> What do you guys think about like the   fraud that's been labeled on the autism   centers here? What What do you guys do   think about the fraud or how come the   autism centers are popping up?   >> I can't answer.   >> What are you a news reporter?   >> My name's Nick.


00:23:37 - 00:23:53
 We're doing a little   documentary trying to find little Joey a   spot to put himself in one of these   centers here cuz there's   >> So why are you asking us about   >> the fraud and stuff like that?   >> Yeah, cuz we want to make sure we're   going to legit business if we're going   to bring our little boy Joey here.   >> This is not a Joey spot.


00:23:52 - 00:24:23
  >> Mhm.   >> But that's our number. But this is a we   can't let you guys.   Oh,   >> okay. Thank you. So once again, little   Joey, he can't even go to daycare and   now they won't even accept him if he has   autism. And again, no kids. Couldn't   tell you how many kids they serve.   >> After being able to provide no evidence   of them actually being an autism center   in a place where a child could go, they   shut the door and we headed to the next   fraudulent daycare center that was just   around the corner.


00:24:22 - 00:24:46
  >> We're on to the next location. We're   still trying to find little Joey a place   to go to get some daycare.   >> So, where we're going now is a place   called Super Kids Daycare Center.   Interestingly,   this daycare center was shut down when   it was called Creative Minds Daycare,   and it had received $2.


00:24:38 - 00:25:08
45 million this   uh fiscal year 2025. They had to shut   down because there were so many   violations and they went and they just   reopened under a new license and they   renamed the center Super Kids Daycare   Center LLC.   >> So, they got shut down then started   another one   >> literally the next day. Creative Minds   Daycare. $2.


00:25:01 - 00:25:31
45 million got sent to this   daycare center. We have   empty parking lot. We do have a bus   here. This is different. We'll see if we   see anybody. I knocked on the door.   Absolutely nobody was inside. And once   again, no children could be heard   anywhere. So, David, once again, another   child daycare center. We have a bus out   here. No one's inside.


00:25:23 - 00:25:54
 Licensed for over   50 kids. No children anywhere but yet   millions of dollars every single year.   >> So the sign says Creative Minds Daycare.   They got in so much trouble. They had so   many violations that they had to shut   down and they reopened the next day   under Super Kids Daycare Center. You see   3801 Portland.


00:25:48 - 00:26:11
 3801 Portland which is   where we are.   >> So that's fraud right there alone.   millions and millions of dollars. And   again, the kids are missing. Where are   the kids?   >> You'd think if they had the same address   that whoever's inside or working at the   capital here inside of Minnesota would   just say, "Oh, maybe that's a red flag.


00:26:10 - 00:26:28
  >> They just they just write the check.   Human services, they got to clean out   the whole bunch. They're the ones who   enabled this fraud." How can you not   look and say, "Wait a minute. This these   two are registered at the same address."   on top of all of the childcare centers.   That's just only a small piece of the   fraud.


00:26:26 - 00:26:53
 What other fraud are they   committing here in Minnesota?   >> So, another major piece of the fraud is   the home healthc care industry.   Where we're going now is a building that   has 14 Somalied home health care   companies in the same building.   >> 14 of the same healthcare companies in   one building.   >> 14 home healthcare companies with   different names in the same building.


00:26:51 - 00:27:20
  How bad has Tim Waltz managed the budget   here inside of Minnesota?   >> So the last bianium we had an $18   billion surplus.   This bianium we have a $6 billion   deficit. That's a $24 billion swing in   one bienium.   How in the world can you burn through   $24 billion in two years? This is how   right here. This is a huge part of it.


00:27:19 - 00:27:41
  And so would you say a lot of that is   fraud that's taking place here in   Minnesota?   >> Absolutely. I would say   better than 90% of it is absolute   outright fraud.   >> And a large percentage of this fraud is   from these healthc care companies that   are charging the state millions of   dollars while they actually aren't   providing anything.


00:27:37 - 00:27:59
 In fact, the FBI   just did a raid aid aid a few days ago   on a building similar to the one we are   about to enter. Inside of this building,   there were 14 of nearly the exact same   businesses offering the exact same   services. Right here, you have a list of   all of the healthcare companies. Loads   of them. Right here, we want healthcare.


00:27:58 - 00:28:25
  >> No, it's okay.   >> Yes, we'd like to speak about getting   healthcare here.   >> No, no, no.   >> Why can't I get healthcare here?   >> No. No. Wait, wait, wait.   >> Warning. You are under video   surveillance. No trespassing. Security   armed.   This is the strangest   place I've ever been to get health care.   Just a bunch of different places.


00:28:21 - 00:28:47
  Healthcare here. Healthcare right here.   Another healthcare company right here.   There are three healthcare companies   inside of this building right here in   this room of 7C.   Now we have another helping hand home   care LLC. Another healthcare company   present help right here. We're looking   for the best rates of health care here   inside this building because we have so   many options.


00:28:44 - 00:29:12
 Who can we talk about   getting the best healthcare?   >> I don't know.   >> No.   >> Sorry.   >> All right.   >> We will not get any healthcare here.   David, this is one of the stranger   places I've ever been.   Literally healthcare every door you go   to. Yet, nobody will give you a rate.   How much money do you think's been   funneled through this building?   >> Every year, I would say 50 to 60 million   at least.


00:29:08 - 00:29:31
 And finally, we were accepted   into one of the daycare centers and they   actually took down information to give   us a rate. However, when we left, we   were then met with the police.   >> I uh we received a complaint that   gentlemen, matching your description,   we're in this building harassing the   individuals who stay here.   >> Oh, we're just seeing we're checking out   the rates for healthcare because there's   14 healthcare companies inside this   building.


00:29:30 - 00:29:49
 So,   >> okay.   >> Well, that's not what he said. He said   there's 14 companies here and he's   trying to assume because they're Somali   providers, everyone here is fraudulent.   Okay. So, he's here with some kind of   like propaganda.   >> No, we're just checking.   >> No, this is this is a um area that we're   allowed to enforce trespassing   ordinance.


00:29:47 - 00:30:04
 Is there any other reason   that you guys are here?   >> Well, we're checking rates.   >> No, he's not.   >> We are checking rates. We asked for   rates.   >> No, you're not.   >> Okay. I'm going to have if you guys are   all good, we're going to step outside   and we can continue this conversation.   >> All right, let's leave. So, all right.   We're getting escorted out right now.


00:30:02 - 00:30:24
  The police have arrived. We were   checking out the rates, seeing what was   happening inside this building. No one   would really speak with us. We did go   inside the one daycare center and she   actually did give us rates for   childcare. Much respect to that lady.   What's the problem, officer?   >> Well, so again, we're we've been getting   reports from there now multiple   individuals that you guys were harassing   individuals who work here.


00:30:22 - 00:30:48
  >> At the end of the day, this is private   property and it's one that people are   allowed to ask you to leave and it's   also one the Minneapolis Police   Department is allowed to enforce   trespassing ordinance at this address.   >> Yeah. So,   >> as we got escorted out of this building,   the Somali filmed us as we left and we   headed over to the next building that   had 22 of the same home healthcare   providers operating from inside of the   building.


00:30:44 - 00:31:07
 Right here you have   multicultural home care. And right here   it says it's open but can't even get in.   Another Reliance Recovery Center, Mercy   and Grace Care, Inc. right here you have   Dunden Eratrayan Youth Development   Association of Minnesota. another child   care center. Welcome to Bright   Beginnings Center.


00:31:04 - 00:31:24
 But what do you guys   think about the fraud that's taking   place here in Minnesota?   >> Sorry, no comments. Can I please?   >> Right here you have Serenity Quality   Care. All of these businesses are   literally the same type of business   providing the same service in the same   building. Another convenience home,   healthc care, aid, Inc.


00:31:21 - 00:31:43
 and   child-friendly space. All these   companies get money from the government.   Why would you have the same company   essentially inside of the same building   doortodoor right here? Queenly Home   Healthcare. It just does not make sense.   If you were trying to operate a   business, you would want to have less   competition.


00:31:38 - 00:31:56
 But here, they have all   their competition right next door. We're   wondering cuz we hear there's lots of   fraud taking place here in Minnesota,   and we're wondering why is there so many   of the same companies inside of this   same building?   >> No, I don't know that.   >> What do you think about the fraud that's   taking place here in Minnesota?   >> I don't have any idea about that fraud.


00:31:56 - 00:32:15
  Okay. Mhm.   >> That's it.   >> What do you think about the news   articles and what's being spared on the   news about the fraud?   >> Right now, you are doing something   wrong.   >> I'm just asking you.   >> No, you don't have to ask me. Okay.   Don't ask me that question again.   >> Okay.   >> Okay.   >> Who can I speak to?   >> Who can I speak to?   >> Okay.


00:32:12 - 00:32:39
 As soon as you confront about the   fraud, they get angry.   >> When these people have these home   healthcare companies, you're seeing them   everywhere inside this building. What   kind of fraud are they committing?   So, there's false documentation being   submitted to the state of Minnesota for   services never provided.   Uh, they're having forms signed in   advance for services that were then   never rendered as far as a year or two   years in advance.


00:32:34 - 00:33:34
 They'll have someone   sign these forms at one sitting and then   they just file those with the state of   Minnesota and nobody from the state of   Minnesota bothers to check that those   services were ever provided. So they're   essentially just using people saying   that they had these services provided   months or even years ago, then filing   the paperwork and then receiving money   from the government,   >> right? And the Somali community is a   very closed community, so everybody's in   on it and they don't want to talk as you   can see.   >> And for this building, I'm going to give   an estimate of around $30 million for   how much fraud is taking place. That is   a very low estimate. However, still a   lot of money in fraud.   >> And do you think there is fraud taking   place here?   >> I don't know. Yeah. Do you have any idea   what any of these businesses are doing?   >> I never ask.   >> And now with upwards of $100 million in   fraud, we'll be headed to one more   daycare. And this one gets a little   spicy as we get chased out at the very


00:33:32 - 00:33:50
  end. And after this, we'll be heading to   the state capital to confront the   incompetent government leaders who have   enabled this fraud to happen. And I knew   this video was going to be super   dangerous to film because of obviously   how hostile it is and as we are exposing   legit fraud happening.


00:33:45 - 00:34:02
 I did get   security for this video and I was able   to do it through the Black Line   Guardian. And if you guys want to help   fund my security in the future, you can   go down to the link down below. They're   not paying me to say any of this. They   came and decided to help me out for this   video.


00:34:00 - 00:34:20
 So you can go to Blackline   Guardian, the links down below, and   click Guardian for Nick. And those funds   will directly go to my security in   future videos as we are exposing lots of   things happening especially with this   fraud. Like I said, they're not   sponsoring this video. I'm just giving   them a shout out because of how they   help me.


00:34:16 - 00:34:45
 So go down the link down below,   click Guardian for Nick, and let's keep   going. And now we're going to the next   location. Now, this child daycare   center, this one's different than all   the other ones we've been to. Tell us   about this one. This one is different   because according to the state of   Minnesota, this 312 West Lake Street   houses not one, not two, but three child   care centers and is licensed to hold 102   children.


00:34:39 - 00:35:07
 And in fiscal year 2025 was   paid 2.66   million by the state of Minnesota. And   this is the building right here. So this   building alone made $2.6 million. Let's   see if anybody's inside. Now we're   inside of the building where there's   apparently four childc care centers. We   met this lady and we followed her to the   back of the building where the daycare   was supposedly at.


00:35:03 - 00:35:32
 So right here we have   two child daycare centers. We have the   Minnesota childcare center and then we   also have Nuna between the two   2.66 million. Hello.   >> Hi.   >> Hi.   >> Why are you talking?   >> Yes. Um we would like to know.   >> Well, it says we're trying to figure out   102 children. Is that for this facility?   >> What? What is the name? Do I see?   >> It's from the state of Minnesota   website.


00:35:28 - 00:35:51
 It says you have 102 children   here in your child care.   >> Which child care name is a lot of   >> Minnesota child care? Right here. It's   from the state of Minnesota's website.   We're just wondering where the children   are.   >> Where are the children?   >> Yeah. Where are the children? It says   you have 102 children here   >> and you got $2.


00:35:46 - 00:36:12
66 66 million this year   in funding   >> and 2.5 million last year. We're just   wondering where the where the kids are   >> and who are you?   >> My name is Nick Shirley.   >> Nick Shirley.   >> Where are you? Where is the harassment?   >> Oh, we are from our stove.   >> Yeah.   >> Hello. We'd like to ask where the   money's going.   >> Look at that. Shut us down.


00:36:08 - 00:36:30
 Where are   the children at? No children inside of   this daycare center. And look at this   daycare center right here. No children   inside of this day center, but between   those buildings over $2.6 million. We   were just curious where are the where   are the children at?   >> Do you know where the children are at?   >> No.


00:36:28 - 00:36:49
  >> Where are the children at in these   daycare centers?   >> I don't care.   >> How come these childcare centers have no   children?   >> I don't know.   >> No.   >> There's $2.6 million inside these   businesses that were given by the   government, but there's no children to   be seen anywhere.   People deserve to know where their taxes   are going.


00:36:45 - 00:37:06
 If these companies and these   daycare centers are making upwards of   $2.6 million and there's no children to   be seen anywhere, something fraudulent   is happening. And that is not make you   racist, Islamophobic. This is just the   truth of what's happening here in   Minnesota. If there's a bunch of white   people doing the same thing, we'd be   talking about the same issue.


00:37:02 - 00:37:24
 This is   just fraud at unprecedented levels here   inside of Minnesota. It's actually very   concerning. Where are the children at   inside of these buildings? They're   nowhere to be seen. Millions of dollars   are being sent into these daycare   centers all across Minnesota, and   there's not a child to be seen anywhere.


00:37:22 - 00:37:48
  Here's another daycare center inside   this same building.   >> What's happening?   >> We don't want you to be videotaping   anything.   >> Where is all the money going for if   there's no children at these daycare   centers,   >> sir?   >> Yes.   >> I told you please.   >> Yes. We have a question though. Where is   the children at these daycare centers if   there's millions of dollars?   >> Ask the local government. Yeah.


00:37:46 - 00:38:08
  >> Oh, we've asked. We have the paper here.   So, we're wondering where the money and   where the children are at. No, we have   the paper right here. Come here.   >> Who are you? First of all,   >> my name is Nick Shirley.   >> You don't have any permission to record   me. Period.   >> Can we talk outside?   >> You have permission to record?   >> She doesn't either have She doesn't have   permission to record me.


00:38:03 - 00:38:24
 You cannot stop   people on the street and question them.   >> You don't have any permission.   >> Where are the children?   >> I will sue you. You don't have any   permission. We have nothing to do with   this.   >> Then are there children?   >> So leave. Please leave.   >> Are there children here?   >> Please leave.   >> Where are the children? $2.


00:38:20 - 00:38:42
6 million for   a daycare center.   >> You ask whoever you think is doing that.   You don't know what you're talking   about. So leave. Leave.   >> Tell us what's happening here then.   >> I said leave.   >> We're wondering what's happening. We are   not a child care. We are nothing to do   with you. We're common people walking   and you are   >> we're not we're not accusing you.


00:38:39 - 00:38:56
 We're   asking where the children are at.   >> Don't ask me anything.   >> We're not accusing you. We're asking the   daycare centers.   >> I am not going to answer. And you have   >> Where are the children at?   >> Leave. Leave.   >> We just want to know where are the   children.   >> Who Who you work for?   >> My name is Nick Shirley.


00:38:55 - 00:39:15
  >> Who do you work for?   >> I work for myself. Nick Shirley.   >> Okay. What are you recording?   >> We're wondering where are the children?   2.6. 66 million for   >> you're not talking   >> the Minnesota childcare center.   >> You're not talking to the right person.   >> Are there children that come here?   >> Answer the question.


00:39:12 - 00:39:30
 Are there children?   >> There's no children inside this   building.   >> I don't know who you talking to me.   >> That's just a simple question. Where are   the children at? David, they won't even   answer. We asked him plain and simple.   Where are the children? Do children come   here?   >> This is why I've had my life I've been   attacked twice.


00:39:28 - 00:40:29
  uh once with a knife and the other time   I was jumped last Saturday by three   Somali men simply for asking questions   about what was going on and they're very   very violent people. They do not like   this fraud to be exposed.   >> After giving this man plenty of   opportunities to answer the simple   question, where are the children? He   called the cops on us and we headed to   the state capital where they're having a   meeting about the fraud to confront the   state representatives and people in the   government who have enabled and let this   fraud happen. Inside of this committee,   a Republican representative showed   charts showing exactly how this fraud   has been committed and who is profiting   and connecting all the dots. And while   the Democrat representatives looked into   the abyss, one of them spoke about how   none of this is building trust and how   this is a nonpartisan issue. So I went   and confronted her after that.   >> Yes. Yes. But I'm He has some very valid   questions to ask about what's going on   here in Minnesota. And do you think this   this fraud crosses My name's Nick   Shirley. Do you think this fraud is


00:40:28 - 00:40:47
  Republican or Democrat or just facts   that fraud is happening?   >> So just   >> I think that as a partisan issue because   that's what I heard you talking about.   >> I know what I said is that we're talking   >> we want to build we want to build trust   but fraud is fraud. So why should we be   enabling fraud to happen here?   >> No, I don't think anybody is enabling   fraud to happen.


00:40:45 - 00:41:01
  >> Hold Governor Walls accountable for   this. Okay, sir.   >> No, no, no. This is sir. When are you   going to hold Governor Walls? No, no,   no. She is a representative for the   state of Minnesota. Yes or no?   >> Um, excuse me. Are you   >> If you're going to talk to me like that,   >> are you going to say to I'm a disability   advocate.


00:40:58 - 00:41:59
 I   >> I heard you and I stimulated   >> to testify. Thank you for testifying   today.   >> No, ma'am.   >> The facts are the facts that fraud is   happening here and it's not a   nonpartisan issue.   >> How come you think fraud has been able   to happen so much underneath? I think if   you've been listening to our test our   hearings, we've had now   >> 10 hearings on this and so there's   really good data from the people who   both work within the administration as   well as who um both Democrat and   Republicans. I think what you heard   today is that the Republicans who   control this committee are not actually   interested in solving fraud. What   they're interested in is telling a   story.   >> This fraud has happened underneath   Democrat leader Tim Waltz. Um there has   been Medicaid fraud across the country   under Democrats and Republicans. There's   fraud within the Trump administration.   There we we have is fraud.   Public private providers have made   government a mark. And so every person   running government, Democrats or   Republicans are dealing with the issue


00:41:57 - 00:42:17
  of how to keep fraudsters out of our   public payment. We're also dealing with   veterans. We're dealing with uh   consumers. I hope you're looking at   that. If you look at United Health   currently is being charged with   defrauding Medicare. You know who runs   Medicare? President Trump. Medicaid   fraud is a 50-st state issue.


00:42:14 - 00:42:32
  >> And so again, it is not a partisan   issue. There are Democrats and   Republicans who are sitting in that   committee talking about it. But what you   did here was the Republican chair say   she's not turning information over to   the one person in government who can   stop payment. And I hope you print that.   >> Is corrupt.


00:42:31 - 00:42:52
  >> Thank you for coming. Did it.   >> This is crazy. Well,   >> this is the state of Minnesota that we   live in and these politicians are just   walking off thinking it's okay Tuesday   and they want to go visit the Trump.   They want to blame the Trump   administration. We have Democrats   blaming ICE. I'm tired.


00:42:47 - 00:43:18
 My people are   suffering.   I'm scared for my little brother.   My people are suffering and these PEOPLE   JUST WALK OFF.   WE HAVE A GOVERNOR who doesn't   care.   How many more people are going to   freaking die?   How many more people are going to go   homeless?   And how many more people are going to be   trafficked in our freaking system?
