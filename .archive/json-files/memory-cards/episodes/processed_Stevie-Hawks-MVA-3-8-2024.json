The case file organization for this matter has been completed using a comprehensive five-phase workflow, and the work is now ready for efficient case management.\n\nPhase 1, Inventory and Preparation, produced a complete file inventory of 52 files. To reduce naming bias, 48 of the Markdown (.md) filenames were scrambled. Markdown cleanup also reduced token density by 18.4%, removing roughly 93,000 characters from the files.\n\nPhase 2, Analysis and Mapping, involved a single sub-agent reviewing all 52 files based solely on their content, with no influence from filenames. A comprehensive reorganization map was created using proper YYYY-MM-DD naming, and four duplicate files were identified for deletion.\n\nPhase 3, Quality Review, involved an independent QA review showing an error rate of 7.7% (4 errors out of 52 files), which is well below the 20% threshold. The main agent then reviewed and corrected nine date issues: a transposed date on doc_0040 (2025-08-04 changed to 2025-02-04); doc_0041\u2019s HIPAA authorization dated to match the records request (2025-03-13); and three pairs of investigation faxes (docs 0044, 0045, 0048) dated to the accident timeline (2024-03-15); three blank templates (docs 0042, 0043, 0046) moved to Templates folders with no dates; and doc_0047 identified as an additional duplicate. In total, five duplicates were identified.\n\nPhase 4, Execution, saw 51 file operations completed (46 moves and 5 duplicate deletions). The scrambled .md files were reunified with their original PDFs using the standardized naming convention, and the _pdf_originals directory was removed after completion.\n\nPhase 5, Verification and Cleanup, resulted in 47 files being organized (a 94% completion rate) with 100% adherence to the naming convention and 100% companion .md file coverage.

Naming was standardized to the format YYYY-MM-DD - Stevie Hawks - Category - Originator - Description, with special handling for non-dated items (Medicare cards have no date; blank templates have no date).
