      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. Client: Ashlee Williams. The file documents communications with Liberty Mutual regarding a motor vehicle accident dated August 29, 2023, involving multiple claimants: Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, Liberty Mutual sent an email to Jessa Galosmo at Whaley Law Firm as well as to counsel at other firms (scott@stoutheukelaw.com and lgraham@kpattorney.com) with the subject Claim#:054658453-01 / Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore. In that message, Liberty Mutual stated that it had received bodily injury demands for Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and that it appeared to have enough information to globally tender the available bodily injury policy limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence to the clients listed (Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore). Liberty Mutual asked for the offices to reach an agreement on how the available limits would be divided among the four claimants, and it offered to appoint defense counsel and schedule a mediation if needed. The email was signed by Robert Elliott and included his contact number, 317-805-2841, and it was issued under a Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company policy (\u00a9 2024 Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116). The metadata associated with this message identified the Claim-Number as 054658453, Exposure-Number as 01, Category as Manual Outbound E-Mail, Description as undefined, and Template-Id as BIFREEFORM.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, at 11:33:40 AM, Jessa Galosmo forwarded the January 11 email to Atty. Whaley with a brief note requesting guidance: \u201cHi Atty. Whaley, How should I respond here?\u201d The forwarded thread includes the earlier message from Robert Elliott and its content, along with the header \u201cFW: Claim#:054658453-01 / Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore.\u201d\n\nIn Elliott\u2019s January 23, 2024 message (dated 9:39?AM), he reiterated that Liberty Mutual had not yet received a response to the January 11 communication and asked whether Whaley\u2019s office had been in contact with the representatives for the other claimants involved in the 8/29/2023 auto accident. The message again referenced the claim number 054658453 and the exposure number 01, and it was addressed to Jessa Galosmo with the same contact context as before. The correspondence confirms that Liberty Mutual remained prepared to tender the policy limits and to coordinate through defense counsel or mediation if the parties agreed on a division of the limits among Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore. The document closes with the same policy disclosure from Liberty Mutual and the signature line for Jessa Galosmo of the Whaley Law Firm, including the firm\u2019s phone and fax numbers.",

This record summarizes email communications concerning Claim #054658453-01, involving Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore, with counsel from Whaley Law Firm and associated firms.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, at 11:10 AM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (Louisville, KY) sent an email to James Kamensky, Esq., and Scott Stout & Heukelaugh (with copies to others) regarding the Liberty Mutual settlement. In the message, Whaley stated that Liberty Mutual had tendered its policy limits of $50,000 to be divided among the four individuals, that he represents Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, and that he proposed apportioning the settlement based on medical bills, asking whether any objections existed. The email included the standard attorney\u2013client/work product privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier, Lexi Graham, Case Manager for the involved firms, replied on January 23, 2024 at 11:16 AM. In her message, she informed Aaron that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney James Kamensky on the email and included her contact information and signature. Her note also contained the usual confidentiality notice.\n\nJames Kamensky, Esq. followed up later that day, January 23, 2024 at 12:08 PM. He wrote that they were currently gathering medical bills for Naomi Robinson but that, generally, they were comfortable with apportionment based on medical bills. He also indicated that he would advise once the medical bill information was available.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, at 12:34:47 PM, Aaron Whaley sent another message asking for the medical-bill amounts for each client. He requested that all parties forward the amounts they had. He listed two figures he already had: Ashlee Williams had medical bills totaling $35,454.24, and Julmonzhae Moore had medical bills totaling $29,092.40.\n\nThe communications show the parties coordinating on how to apportion a $50,000 settlement among the four claimants\u2014Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Daquan Graham, and Naomi Robinson\u2014based on the medical bills, with ongoing efforts to gather the relevant billing information for all four clients and with standard confidentiality protections in place.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023 involves Ashlee Williams following a motor vehicle accident on August 29, 2023, with Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, and Julmonzhae Moore also named in the claim. The matter is identified as Claim No. 054658453-01. The recited communications show ongoing settlement discussions among counsel from Whaley Law Firm and Stout & Heuke Law Office, with James Kamensky and Lexi Graham among the recipients and August 2023 accident-related claimants copied on the messages.\n\nThe core issue in the correspondence is how to allocate Liberty Mutual\u2019s $50,000 liability limit among the four claimants. Liberty Mutual tendered the full $50,000 to be divided among Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore, and Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore were represented by Aaron Whaley. Whaley proposed apportioning the limits using the medical bills as the basis for division and asked whether there were any objections.\n\nIn the early exchanges, Whaley reported the following medical-bill amounts: Ashlee Williams had $35,454.24 in medical bills, and Julmonzhae Moore had $29,092.40. He also noted that those figures were being used to inform the proposed apportionment. Lexi Graham informed the group that the handling attorney James Kamensky was cc\u2019d on the email thread. James Kamensky indicated that they were still gathering medical bills for Naomi Robinson and that apportionment based on medical bills would be the general approach, with further advisement to follow once the bills were in. On January 31, 2024, Whaley asked for the amounts of medical bills each client had, reporting that he already had Ashlee Williams at $35,454.24 and Julmonzhae Moore at $29,092.40.\n\nScott Stout of Stout & Heuke later stated on February 8, 2024 that they were gathering bills and records for Daquan Graham as well and did not object to dividing the settlement based on medical bills. A follow-up on February 12, 2024 confirmed that Daquan Graham\u2019s medical bills were $7,195.00.\n\nBy March 1, 2024, Whaley followed up again, noting it was Friday and seeking confirmation that the remaining outstanding medical bills were only those for Naomi Robinson, with the implication that all other medical-bill totals were already identified in the apportionment plan.\n\nIn summary, the record shows a four-party claim under Liberty Mutual\u2019s limits, with the proposed method of allocation anchored to medical-bill totals: Ashlee Williams $35,454.24, Julmonzhae Moore $29,092.40, Daquan Graham $7,195.00, and Naomi Robinson\u2019s bills not yet finalized as of the last update. The parties have been coordinating through multiple emails from January through March 2024 to finalize the bill totals and confirm the apportionment method.",

The client appreciated the update and looks forward to hearing from AW.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023 involves Ashlee Williams and co-claimants Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham under Liberty Mutual Insurance, with claim number 054658453-01. The communications center on Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills and on the distribution of the global policy limit tender. The parties in the email thread include Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (Louisville, KY); James Kamensky, Esq., of KP Attorneys; Lexi Graham (Case Manager); Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office; and Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual, with Ashlee Williams copied on the correspondence. The thread runs from March to April 2024 and references a policy under Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, including a note in the March 14 email that the messages are confidential attorney\u2013client and/or work product privileged material.\n\nThe first substantive item appears in a March 6, 2024 message from Robert Elliott at Liberty Mutual, asking for guidance on whether the offices had come to an agreement on the distribution of the global policy limit tender to the clients. A subsequent March 13, 2024 message from Aaron Whaley asks for updates on Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and medical bills. Later that same day, Scott Stout replies that \u201cDaquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted our bills.\u201d Aaron Whaley follows up again on March 13, 2024, noting that they are \u201cjust waiting on Naomi Robinson to submit her medical bills.\u201d On March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham emails to inform that she has cc\u2019d the handling attorney on the Naomi Robinson matter. In the same thread, James Kamensky, Esq., responds with a March 14, 2024 message stating, \u201cWaiting on medical bills and records to arrive for Naomi Robinson.\u201d This March 14 exchange includes the standard attorney\u2013client and/or work product privileged notices in the signatures.\n\nThroughout the thread, the claim remains the same, and the communications repeatedly center on Naomi Robinson\u2019s required medical bills and records and the status of bills for Daquan Graham. The April 9, 2024 message from Aaron Whaley asks again, \u201cJames how are we doing on the records and bills for Naomi?\u201d and a final follow-up on April 16, 2024 asks, \u201cFollowing up again on the records and bills for Naomi Robinson. James, do you have these records and bills? If not what is the hold up?\u201d The chain thus documents ongoing efforts to obtain Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical documentation and to finalize the handling of bills and the distribution of the global policy limit tender in this multipart MVA case.",

The accompanying correspondence tracks efforts by counsel for the plaintiffs and the insurer to obtain Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills, as well as other bills related to the case.\n\nIn early March 2024, Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual asked whether the offices had reached an agreement on the distribution of the global policy limit tender to the clients. By March 6, 2024, the record indicates that the request for Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records was still outstanding. On March 13, 2024, Aaron Whaley asked James Kamensky for updates on Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills, asking what the hold\u2011up might be if the records were not yet available. Shortly thereafter, Scott Stout stated that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted their bills. On March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham informed the group that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney for Naomi Robinson, and later that day James Kamensky replied that they were waiting for Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records to arrive.\n\nThe thread continued with a follow\u2011up on April 9, 2024, when Aaron Whaley again inquired about the status of Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills. On April 16, 2024, Aaron followed up once more, asking James whether the records and bills had been obtained and, if not, what was causing the delay. James Kamensky responded on the same day that the request was still in process with UofL Hospital in Louisville, KY. A subsequent message from Aaron Whaley reiterated the inquiry about Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills.\n\nFinally, on May 7, 2024, Aaron Whaley wrote to James Kamensky again, noting concern and asking whether there were issues obtaining the records. He pointed out that it had been since February, at least, and sought an update on the status of the records and bills for Naomi Robinson as part of the Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham matter (Claim #054658453-01). Throughout these exchanges, the primary focus remained obtaining Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills, as well as other related bills, to advance the case.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns Ashlee Williams in the motor vehicle accident matter titled Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023, with client Ashlee Williams and related parties Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham. The formal claim number is 054658453-01. The communications below were exchanged among the firm\u2019s attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, James Kamensky (Kamensky & Patteson, LLP), and the supporting team, including Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams, across March through May 2024.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent an email to James Kamensky, with copies to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams, simply noting that he was \u201ccircling back again\u201d and asking how things were progressing on the matter.\n\nEarlier that week, on May 7, 2024, Whaley followed up again with James Kamensky, asking whether there were any issues obtaining certain records, and flagging that it had been since February at the very least.\n\nIn mid-April 2024, on April 16, James Kamensky replied that the request for records and bills remained in process with University of Louisville (UofL) Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nSignificantly, in March 2024 there were several exchanges regarding Naomi Robinson and other related bills and records. On March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham, serving as Case Manager, informed the recipients that she had CC\u2019d the handling attorney on Naomi Robinson\u2019s matter, signaling that internal coordination was being managed among the handling attorney, the case team, and the insurer.\n\nEarlier, on March 13, 2024, Scott Stout advised that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted their bills for the matter. His message provided Louisville and Downtown Louisville office contact details for Stout & Heuke Law Office.\n\nAlso on March 13, 2024, at 2:41 PM, Aaron Whaley sent a reply to Robert Elliott (with copies to Scott Stout and Lexi Graham, and to Ashlee Williams) asking for updates and noting that they were likely waiting on Naomi Robinson to submit her medical bills.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 2:44 PM on March 13, 2024, Scott Stout responded, confirming that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted their bills.\n\nEarlier still, on March 6, 2024, Robert Elliott from Liberty Mutual asked for guidance on whether the offices had reached an agreement regarding the distribution of the global policy limit tender to the clients. The thread at that time referenced the policy being underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company and included the typical attorney\u2013client and work-product confidentiality language found in the signatures of the emails. The messages also contained standard professional signatures with the respective offices\u2019 addresses: Kamensky\u2019s offices in Columbia, South Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama; and Stout & Heuke\u2019s offices in Louisville, Kentucky; as well as other locations listed in the signatures.\n\nThroughout these communications, the key actors remained the same: Ashlee Williams and the related claimants, Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), James Kamensky (Kamensky & Patteson, LLP), Lexi Graham (Case Manager), Scott Stout (Stout & Heuke Law Office), and Robert Elliott (Liberty Mutual), with Ashlee Williams also copied on the emails. The underlying themes included obtainingMedical records and bills (notably for Naomi Robinson), the submission of bills by Daquan Graham (on behalf of Stout & Heuke), and efforts to resolve timing and fund distribution questions related to the global policy limit tender.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Ashlee Williams, a motor vehicle accident matter dated August 29, 2023, the client Ashlee Williams, along with Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, is being handled under Claim number 054658453-01. The matter involved Whaley Law Firm and KP Attorneys, with Liberty Mutual as the insurer, and the correspondence stream included Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), James Kamensky (KP Attorneys), Lexi Graham (case manager), Scott Stout (Stout & Heuke), Robert Elliott (Liberty Mutual), and Ashlee Williams.\n\nThe communications begin with questions about the status of the University of Louisville (UofL) medical records. On June 4, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent an email to James Kamensky asking why it was taking six months to obtain the UofL records and offering assistance to help move things along so he could advise his clients.\n\nLooking back through the thread, the first noted point in the chain appears in early March 2024 with Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual asking whether the offices had reached an agreement on distributing the global policy limit tender to the clients, which was a separate point of coordination in the case.\n\nOn March 13, 2024, Scott Stout reported that Daquan Graham, via Stout & Heuke, had submitted their bills. That same day, Aaron Whaley followed up with James Kamensky, asking for updates and specifically whether Naomi Robinson had submitted her medical bills, noting that it had been at least since February and implying a delay or hold-up.\n\nThe following day, March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham notified the team that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney on the Naomi Robinson matter. Later that day, at about 11:38 a.m., James Kamensky stated that they were waiting on Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records to arrive. The thread shows standard attorney-client and work-product confidentiality notices within the signatures, consistent with the firm practices.\n\nOver the next weeks, additional follow-ups occurred. On March 13 and March 14, the group continued to seek updates on Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills, with Aaron Whaley and others asking for status and James Kamensky noting that Naomi\u2019s records and bills were still pending.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, Aaron Whaley again asked how the records and bills for Naomi were coming along. James Kamensky replied on April 16, 2024 that the request was still in process with UofL Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. Aaron Whaley then followed up again on April 16, 2024, asking James whether he had Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills, and, if not, what the hold-up might be.\n\nAs spring progressed, the follow-up continued. On May 7, 2024, Aaron Whaley asked if there were any issues obtaining the records, noting that it had been since February at least. The conversation persisted, and on May 13, 2024, Aaron circled back once more, asking how things were progressing. James Kamensky replied on May 13, 2024 that the requests were still in process. A separate response on May 13, 2024, at 2:11 p.m., again stated that the requests were still in process.\n\nThroughout the thread, it is noted that Daquan Graham\u2019s bills had been submitted, as Scott Stout had indicated, while Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills remained the outstanding item to be obtained. The chain shows ongoing coordination among the law firms, Liberty Mutual, and the client team, with repeated inquiries about the Naomi Robinson records and bills and periodic confirmations that the records were still in process.\n\nIn summary, from March through June 2024, the team repeatedly sought Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records, with Daquan Graham\u2019s and the other bills already submitted, and the UofL hospital records for Naomi Robinson unresolved. By June 4, 2024, Aaron Whaley explicitly questioned the six-month delay in obtaining the UofL records and offered to assist to move the process forward so he could advise his clients.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. The case concerns Ashlee Williams, with related references to Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, under Claim number 054658453-01. The matter centers on obtaining medical records and bills, particularly from the University of Louisville (UofL) hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, for Naomi Robinson, as part of the ongoing representation by Whaley Law Firm and allied counsel.\n\nOn June 24, 2024 at 4:21 p.m. Eastern Time, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm\u2014located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222 and reachable at 502-583-4022\u2014sent an email asking, \u201cAny progress on this?\u201d The message was addressed to James Kamensky, Esq., and copied to Ashlee Williams and several other involved counsel and parties, including Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual, Lexi Graham, and Scott Stout, among others. The email thread that followed reveals a multi-month effort to secure UofL records and the medical bills for Naomi Robinson.\n\nThe chronology begins earlier in 2024. On June 4, 2024, James Kamensky wrote to the team asking for a good point of contact (POC) for UofL so he could relay it to their records team. He signed with his firm\u2019s multi-office address listing, and included the standard confidential/material-privilege notice typical of attorney-client communications.\n\nEarlier, on May 13, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent a message asking, \u201cCircling back again. James, how are we doing?\u201d This followed a prior exchange in which James Kamensky had replied that \u201cRequests are still in process.\u201d In that same period, the parties continued to discuss the status of the records and bills.\n\nThe thread traces back to March 13\u201314, 2024. On March 13, 2024, at 2:41 p.m., Aaron Whaley asked James Kamensky for updates on the case, particularly regarding the records. At 2:44 p.m. that day, Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office responded that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted their bills. The next day, March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham, the case manager, informed the group that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney for Naomi Robinson. Later that day, at 11:38 a.m., James Kamensky replied that they were waiting on medical bills and records to arrive for Naomi Robinson.\n\nThat weekend and into April 2024, the status remained unsettled. On April 9, 2024, Aaron Whaley asked, \u201cJames how are we doing on the records and bills for Naomi?\u201d On April 16, 2024, at 11:56 a.m., James Kamensky stated that the request was still in process with the UofL hospital in Louisville, KY. Earlier that same day, at 11:47 a.m., Aaron Whaley followed up again, asking whether James had the records and bills for Naomi Robinson and, if not, what was causing the hold-up.\n\nBy May, the delays were described more pointedly. On May 7, 2024, Aaron asked, \u201cJames, I am just following up on this. Are you having any issues getting these records? It has been since February, at least.\u201d Then, on May 13, 2024, Aaron again pressed, \u201cCircling back again. James, how are we doing?\u201d James replied later that day, \u201cRequests are still in process.\u201d A few minutes earlier, on May 13, 2024, at 2:01 p.m., Aaron had written to James with the same query, and at 2:11 p.m., James reaffirmed that the requests were still in process.\n\nIn the midst of these exchanges, there was confirmation that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted our bills, as noted by Scott Stout in his March 13, 2024 message. This collaboration involved multiple parties: Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm; James Kamensky, Esq., for KPATT; Lexi Graham, the case manager; Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office; and Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual, with Ashlee Williams cc\u2019d on communications.\n\nThe thread includes the usual attorney-client and work-product confidentiality notices embedded in signatures, and lists a broad set of offices and contact details for the respective attorneys: James Kamensky\u2019s multi-location offices (Columbia, SC; Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN) and Boca Raton, FL; Aaron Whaley\u2019s Louisville office; Lexi Graham\u2019s assorted offices in Clayton, MO; Chicago, IL; New Orleans, LA; Milwaukee, WI; and Boca Raton, FL; Scott Stout\u2019s Louisville offices; and Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual.\n\nIn summary, from March through June 2024, counsel repeatedly sought, followed up, and attempted to obtain Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills from the UofL hospital, with Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke having submitted some bills, and with the handling attorney for Naomi Robinson identified. As of the June 24, 2024 email, there remained no final confirmation of receipt of all records and bills, and Aaron Whaley prompted another check for progress. The case remains linked to the motor vehicle accident for Ashlee Williams dated August 29, 2023, with related claim participants and the same Claim number: 054658453-01.",

      "natural_language": "In the Ashlee Williams case, docketed as Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023 and involving clients Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham under Claim 054658453-01, the parties handled a sequence of records, bills, and policy-tender issues across several months in early 2024. The thread begins with Liberty Mutual\u2019s Robert Elliott asking whether the offices had reached an agreement on the distribution of the global policy limit tender to the clients, a query dated March 6, 2024.\n\nOn March 13, 2024, Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office advised that Daquan Graham\u2019s bills had been submitted. That same day, Aaron Whaley followed up, asking James Kamensky whether the records and bills for Naomi Robinson were in hand, and if not, what was causing the delay. The inquiry reflected the ongoing effort to obtain Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills.\n\nThe next day, March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham, the case manager, informed the team that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney on the Naomi Robinson matter. Later that morning, James Kamensky replied that they were waiting on Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records to arrive.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, Aaron Whaley again asked James Kamensky how they were progressing with Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills. A week later, on April 16, 2024, Whaley followed up once more: \u201cFollowing up again on the records and bills for Naomi Robinson. James, do you have these records and bills? If not what is the hold up?\u201d Kamensky\u2019s response two minutes later indicated that the request was still in process with the University of Louisville (UofL) hospital in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nFinally, on June 26, 2024, Aaron Whaley emailed James Kamensky and Ashlee Williams, asking for an update. He stated that if UL (UofL) had not yet provided the information, he would like Kamensky to disclose the amount of Naomi Robinson\u2019s other bills to help him form a clearer picture.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications carried their typical attorney\u2013client confidentiality notices, with multiple emails noting privileged material and the confidential nature of the communications. The overarching issue centered on Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills and records, the submission status of Daquan Graham\u2019s bills, and the distribution of the global policy limit tender among the involved clients in Claim 054658453-01, with the University of Louisville hospital in Louisville, KY identified as the current hold-up for Naomi Robinson\u2019s records.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. This matter concerns Ashlee Williams and her co-claimants\u2014Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham\u2014under Claim Number 054658453-01, arising from a motor vehicle accident on August 29, 2023. The case file shows an ongoing effort to obtain medical records and related bills from the University of Louisville (UofL), with a focus on Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and the bills submitted by Daquan Graham. The latest communication, dated July 10, 2024, comes from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to James Kamensky, with copies to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams. The message asks for updates on the UL (UofL) records, noting that it has been over five months since limits were tendered.\n\nThe thread traces a multi-month effort to obtain records from UofL. On June 4, 2024, James Kamensky asked for a good point of contact for UofL so he could relay the request to their records team. In a follow-up the same day, Aaron Whaley asked whether there was a reason it was taking six months to obtain UofL records and offered to assist, emphasizing the need to inform his clients. Earlier in the month, on May 13, 2024, Kamensky replied that the requests were still in process, and Whaley circulated a further follow-up the same day, asking for an update. A prior message from May 7, 2024, had already questioned whether there were issues getting the records since February. The chain also shows that on April 16, 2024, Kamensky stated the request was still in process with UofL Hospital in Louisville, KY, and Whaley followed up about Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills. In mid-March 2024, Lexi Graham cc\u2019d the handling attorney for Naomi Robinson, and Scott Stout reported that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted our bills. Earlier that day, Aaron Whaley asked Robert Elliott for any updates, noting that they were waiting on Naomi Robinson to submit her medical bills. The earlier portion of the thread includes standard attorney signatures and confidentiality notices in the email footers, and shows that the involved parties included Ashlee Williams, with communications circulated among James Kamensky, Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, and Robert Elliott, among others.\n\nAs of the July 10, 2024 email, the status remains unresolved with UofL regarding the records, and Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills have not had a final submission confirmed, while Daquan Graham\u2019s bills had been reported as submitted by Scott Stout. The thread reflects ongoing efforts to obtain a point of contact at UofL, to secure the necessary records and bills, and to update the clients on progress.",

The matter involves multiple clients\u2014Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham\u2014under claim number 054658453-01, with communications among Ashlee Williams\u2019s counsel and related parties about obtaining medical records and bills from the University of Louisville (UofL) and related billing submissions.\n\nOn July 12, 2024 at 13:53:51 -0400, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to James Kamensky, Esq., with copies to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams. The subject reiterated the four clients and the claim number, and the body stated simply: Circling back on this. Would like to get this resolved as soon as possible. This email was a follow-up in a longer thread about UL records and related bills.\n\nThe prior thread began with a message on July 10, 2024, in which Aaron Whaley asked: Any updates on the UL records? It has been over 5 months since limits were tendered. Before that, on June 4, 2024 at 4:45 PM, James Kamensky, Esq. asked: Do you have a good point of contact for UofL? I will relay to our records team. James\u2019s signature block shows him as a Partner with offices in Columbia, SC; Birmingham, AL; and Indianapolis, IN, and he includes the standard privileged material disclaimer.\n\nEarlier that same day, June 4, 2024 at 4:26 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to James Kamensky with copies to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams. He asked whether there was a reason it was taking six months to obtain UofL records and offered assistance to advise his clients.\n\nThe preceding messages show a longer back-and-forth. On May 13, 2024 at 2:11 PM, James Kamensky replied: Requests are still in process. That followed a May 13, 2024 2:01 PM message from Aaron Whaley circling back again and asking how things were progressing. In early May 2024, Aaron had been following up after a February timeframe, noting ongoing issues obtaining the records.\n\nOn April 16, 2024, James Kamensky informed that the request was still in process with UofL hospital in Louisville, KY. Earlier that morning, Aaron Whaley had written (April 16, 2024 11:47 AM) asking whether James had the records and bills for Naomi Robinson and, if not, what was causing the hold-up. James\u2019s prior reply on April 16, 2024 at 11:56 AM stated the same: the request remained in process with the UofL hospital.\n\nThe thread also includes communications related to Naomi Robinson\u2019s records and bills. On March 14, 2024, Lexi Graham, Case Manager, replying to Scott Stout and Aaron Whaley, indicated that she had cc\u2019d the handling attorney for Naomi Robinson. In a separate March 13, 2024 message, Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office reported that Daquan Graham\u2019s bills had been submitted. The body of that exchange includes the Louisville offices and contact details for Stout & Heuke, as well as the standard attorney\u2013client privileged notice.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the participants consistently referenced Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills, the status of the records request with UofL hospital in Louisville, KY, and the need to obtain or confirm the bills associated with Naomi Robinson and the other named clients. By mid-July 2024, despite multiple follow-ups and the assignment of a point of contact for UofL, the UL records and related bills for Naomi Robinson reportedly remained outstanding, and the team reiterated that they wished to resolve the issue as soon as possible for the four clients under the same claim.\n\nIn sum, this case\u2019s documentation reflects ongoing efforts since at least February 2024 to obtain Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical records and bills (and related submissions for Daquan Graham) from UofL, with repeated requests, several follow-ups across multiple weeks and months, and no definitive resolution as of the July 12, 2024 correspondence. The matter is part of the Ashlee Williams case (MVA dated 08-29-2023) involving Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham under Claim# 054658453-01, with communication among Aaron Whaley, James Kamensky, Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and the clients.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative consolidates the Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023 case notes and the accompanying email correspondence, including the proposed allocation of medical-bill recovery and the ongoing communications about medical records and related issues.\n\nCase overview and proposed allocation\nThe case is titled Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023 and involves client Ashlee Williams. The correspondence concerns four claimants: Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, and Daquan Graham, under Claim #: 054658453-01. The initial note documents a correspondence dated Monday, July 15, 2024 at 12:59:43 PM (-0400) from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) to James Kamensky, Esq. (jkamensky@kpattorney.com), with cc\u2019s to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams (ashleewilliamsmvaz3887726@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The subject line is \u201cRe: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham / Claim#:054658453-01.\u201d\n\nA proposed breakdown based on total medical bills is as follows:\n- Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44\n- Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23\n- Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08\n- Daquan Graham: $3,379.25\n\nThe accompanying calculations are listed as:\n- Naomi Robinson 32754 0.307668781 15383.43905\n- Ashlee Williams 35138.24 0.3300647087 16503.23543\n- Julmonzhae Moore 31371.4 0.2946815777 14734.07889\n- Daquan Graham 7195 0.06758493251 3379.246626\n\nOngoing discussion about hospital records, bills, and coverage\nIn a reply dated Friday, July 12, 2024, at approximately 2:05 PM (the time is recorded as 2:05?PM in the record), James Kamensky, Esq. wrote that hospital records and billing were pending. He noted that collateral source information showed a total billed amount of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic. He asked for input on several topics: what about the other claimants\u2019 specials, whether the injuries were significant, and whether applicable UIM (uninsured/underinsured motorist) coverage applied.\n\nJames Kamensky\u2019s signature and contact details follow in the record, including multiple office locations (Columbia, SC; Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN) and mailing address in Boca Raton, FL, with the usual attorney\u2013client and/or work product privileged material disclaimer.\n\nEarlier and related correspondence in the thread\nThe thread includes a substantial history of back-and-forth between Aaron Whaley and James Kamensky (and occasionally others such as Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, and Robert Elliott), spanning several months in 2024. The following timeline captures the gist of those communications, preserving the dates and the key points:\n\n- July 12, 2024 (1:54 PM): Aaron Whaley wrote to James Kamensky, cc\u2019ing Lexi Graham; Scott Stout; Robert Elliott; and Ashlee Williams, circulating on the topic of the Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham case and asking to advance resolution.\n\n- July 12, 2024 (2:05 PM): James Kamensky\u2019s earlier message (quoted above) regarding hospital records, billing, collateral sources, total billed amounts, and questions about specials, injury significance, and UIM.\n\n- July 10, 2024 (11:53 AM): Aaron Whaley asked for updates on UofL records, noting that it had been over five months since limits were tendered.\n\n- June 4, 2024 (4:45 PM): James Kamensky asked for a good point of contact (POC) for UofL, indicating intent to relay to the records team. The record shows a parallel exchange on the same day from Aaron Whaley (4:26 PM) raising the question of the status of UofL records and offering assistance if needed, followed by James\u2019s request for a UofL POC.\n\n- June 4, 2024 (4:26 PM): Aaron Whaley responded, asking whether there was a good POC for UofL and noting the desire to know why it had taken six months to obtain UofL records, offering to assist in advising clients.\n\n- May 13, 2024 (2:11 PM): James Kamensky replied that the requests were still in process.\n\n- May 13, 2024 (2:01 PM): Aaron Whaley circled back again, asking how the status was progressing.\n\n- May 7, 2024 (1:10 PM): Aaron Whaley followed up, asking whether there were issues obtaining records, noting it had been at least since February.\n\n- April 16, 2024 (11:56 AM): James Kamensky stated that the request was still in process with the UofL hospital in Louisville, KY.\n\n- April 16, 2024 (11:47 AM): Aaron Whaley followed up on the Naomi Robinson records and bills, asking James if he had them or what was causing the delay.\n\n- April 9, 2024 (2:25 PM): Aaron Whaley asked James how things were progressing with the records and bills for Naomi.\n\n- March 14, 2024 (11:38 AM): James Kamensky indicated that they were waiting on medical bills and records to arrive for Naomi Robinson.\n\n- March 14, 2024 (10:01 AM): Lexi Graham sent an entry with the subject line \u201cRE: Ashlee W\u201d to Scott Stout, Aaron Whaley, and Robert Elliott, with James Kamensky cc\u2019d, though the snippet ends with an incomplete subject line.\n\nPrivileged material and contact details\nThroughout the thread, standard attorney\u2013client and work product privileged material notices appear in the signatures. James Kamensky\u2019s signature appears with multiple office locations (Columbia, SC; Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN) and a Boca Raton mailing address, including the disclaimers about confidentiality and the proper handling of messages if the recipient is not the intended recipient.\n\nIn sum\nThe note captures a case in which four claimants\u2014Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, and Daquan Graham\u2014are being managed together under Claim #: 054658453-01, with an initial proposed allocation based on total medical bills and accompanying calculations. It also documents a multi-month effort to obtain hospital records and bills (notably from UofL) and to confirm collateral sources, specials for the other claimants, injury significance, and applicability of UIM coverage. The email thread shows ongoing coordination between the law firms and the insurer regarding these records, bills, and related issues, including multiple reminders and requests for points of contact at UofL, with several professional disclaimers about confidentiality woven throughout.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. Client: Ashlee Williams. Re: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham / Claim#: 054658453-01.\n\nThe matter and related communications concerned four claimants\u2014Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham\u2014under the above claim number. The email thread began in mid-July 2024, with Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and James Kamensky, Esq., coordinating colleagues and sending copies to Ashlee Williams and others, including Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual, Lexi Graham, and Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office, among others. The thread includes several law-firm office location blocks for James Kamensky, Esq., detailing multiple regional addresses and contact information.\n\nOn July 17, 2024, Aaron Whaley asserted that the parties did not have access to any underinsured coverage either. Earlier that day, James Kamensky indicated that, with respect to underinsured coverage, Naomi Robinson did not have it (stating \u201cUnderinsured? Naomi does not, see attached.\u201d) and he provided a standard attorney-client confidentiality footer in the email chain.\n\nA separate message in the chain from Scott Stout, dated July 15, 2024 at 1:24 PM, acknowledged a misreading and apologized, instructing recipients to disregard that previous portion of his communication. In the same exchange, Stout\u2019s contact information for Stout & Heuke Law Office was included, along with Louisville and downtown Louisville office addresses.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on July 12, 2024 at 2:05 PM, James Kamensky asked for hospital records and noted collateral-source information showing total billed amounts of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic. He queried about the status of specials for the other claimants, whether there was a significant injury, and whether applicable UIM would apply. Aaron Whaley had previously indicated in the thread that he was awaiting these records and information to facilitate resolution.\n\nA day earlier, on July 10, 2024 at 11:53 AM, Aaron Whaley had prompted for updates on University of Louisville (UofL) records, noting that it had been over five months since limits were tendered, and he offered assistance. May and June 2024 exchanges show ongoing efforts to obtain POCs and to keep requests in process; James Kamensky advised that requests were still in process and, later, sought a good point of contact for UofL records to relay to their records team. The conversation throughout May and June 2024 repeatedly referenced delays in obtaining UofL records.\n\nOn July 12, 2024 at 1:54 PM, Aaron Whaley circled back, expressing a desire to resolve the matter promptly. That message was part of the longer chain noting hospital and collateral-source information, and continued with follow-up messages on July 15 and July 17.\n\nIn terms of the proposed allocation of amounts based on total medical bills, James Kamensky provided a breakdown on July 15, 2024. He itemized proposed shares as follows:\n- Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44 (billed amount listed as 32,754 with a proportion of 0.307668781, producing 15,383.43905)\n- Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23 (billed amount listed as 35,138.24 with a proportion of 0.3300647087, producing 16,503.23543)\n- Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08 (billed amount listed as 31,371.4 with a proportion of 0.2946815777, producing 14,734.07889)\n- Daquan Graham: $3,379.25 (billed amount listed as 7,195 with a proportion of 0.06758493251, producing 3,379.246626)\n\nThe total figures presented by Kamensky reflected a breakdown based on the total medical bills among the four claimants, with the calculated shares aligning to the numbers above.\n\nThroughout the thread, standard confidentiality language appeared, including the declaration: \u201cATTORNEY\u2013CLIENT AND/OR WORK PRODUCT PRIVILEGED MATERIAL. This email message and any attachments are confidential. If you are not the intended recipient, please immediately reply to the sender and delete the message from your email system.\u201d Various office locations and contact information for the involved attorneys were included in the circulating emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. Client: Ashlee Williams. This note summarizes the email communications concerning the four claimants in the matter titled \u201cAshlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham / Claim#: 054658453-01,\u201d dated August 1, 2024.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm emailed James Kamensky, Esq., with copies to Ashlee Williams, Robert Elliott, Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, and others. In that message, Aaron stated that he had authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, and he asked whether James Kamensky had authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson. The message closed with thanks.\n\nThe prior thread began on July 17, 2024. In James Kamensky\u2019s reply at approximately 12:10 PM, he wrote that he needed a few days to confer with the client and assess medical billing, but he would let the sender know. In an earlier message on the same day, around 12:09 PM, Aaron Whaley responded that they did not have access to any underinsured coverage either. Earlier still that day, at about 10:55 AM, James Kamensky had asked, \u201cUnderinsured? Naomi does not, see attached.\u201d This exchange indicates questions about underinsured motorist coverage for Naomi Robinson.\n\nPrior to that, on July 15, 2024 at 1:24 PM, Scott Stout sent a message (to Aaron Whaley and James Kamensky, with Lexi Graham, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams cc\u2019d) noting, \u201cWait. I misread that. I see where I made the mistake. My apologies. Please disregard.\u201d This was part of a back-and-forth effort to confirm the correct allocations and coverage among the claimants.\n\nEarlier on July 15, 2024 at 1:00 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to James Kamensky (with copies to Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, Robert Elliott, and Ashlee Williams) with a proposed breakdown based on total medical bills. The proposed allocations were as follows: Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44; Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23; Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08; Daquan Graham: $3,379.25. Whaley included the corresponding mathematical breakdown below these figures, listing for Naomi Robinson the values 32754, 0.307668781, and 15383.43905; for Ashlee Williams 35138.24, 0.3300647087, and 16503.23543; for Julmonzhae Moore 31371.4, 0.2946815777, and 14734.07889; and for Daquan Graham 7195, 0.06758493251, and 3379.246626.\n\nOn July 12, 2024 at about 2:05 PM, James Kamensky sent a message noting that hospital records and billing were pending, but that collateral source information had been received showing a total billed amount of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic. He asked what had happened with the other claimants\u2019 specials, whether there were any significant injuries, and whether underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) might apply.\n\nThat same day, July 12, 2024 at 1:54 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, \u201cCircling back on this. Would like to get this resolved as soon as possible.\u201d He was reiterating the push to finalize the matter promptly.\n\nOn July 10, 2024 at 11:53 AM, Aaron Whaley asked, \u201cAny updates on the UL records? It has been over 5 months since limits were tendered.\u201d He was seeking progress on obtaining underinsured/uninsured motorist records from the University of Louisville (UofL).\n\nEarlier still, on June 4, 2024, at 4:45 PM, James Kamensky asked, \u201cDo you have a good POC for UofL? I will relay to our records team,\u201d seeking a point of contact at UofL to obtain records.\n\nFinally, on June 4, 2024 at 4:26 PM, Aaron Whaley responded to James Kamensky, saying, \u201cJames, still waiting? Is there a reason why it is taking 6 months to get UofL records? Happy to help. I am just trying to get a little bit o[?].\u201d The email appears cut off at the end of that line.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the participants included Ashlee Williams (the client), Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham as claimants, with the primary attorneys Aaron Whaley, James Kamensky, Esq., Scott Stout, and Robert Elliott (Liberty Mutual) among the correspondents. The communications address medical billing, coverage issues including underinsured motorist coverage, collateral sources, and the status of medical bills and hospital records. The case file reference remains 054658453-01, associated with the case Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee Williams was involved in a motor vehicle accident on August 29, 2023. The client listed is Ashlee Williams, and the matter covers four claimants: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, under Claim Number 054658453-01.\n\nThe communications span several weeks in mid-2024 and involve Ashlee Williams\u2019s case file shared among multiple counsel and parties. The thread opens with Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm noting that James Kamensky represents Naomi Robinson and confirming that all counsel had been contacted. He asks to be informed when authorization is obtained and inquires of Scott Stout whether he has discussed authorization with Daquan Graham. James Kamensky replies that his firm \u201conly rep[s] Robinson and auth pending,\u201d signaling that authority to resolve the other claimants was not yet established. The exchange includes standard attorney-client and work-product privilege notices.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on July 17, 2024, James Kamensky indicates he will need a few days to confer with his client and assess medical billing before providing a determination. In parallel, Aaron Whaley notes that his firm \u201chas authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore,\u201d and asks whether the other two claimants, Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson, have authority to resolve as well. At that point, there is also a statement that the party does not have access to any underinsured coverage.\n\nComplicating the discussions are questions about uninsured or underinsured motorist issues and collateral sources. On July 12, 2024, James Kamensky asks for hospital records and billing to be completed, and notes collateral source information showing total billed amounts of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic. He also asks about \u201cother claimants\u2019 specials,\u201d whether any of the claimants sustained significant injury, and whether applicable UIM coverage exists. Earlier on July 12, Aaron Whaley responds, circling back and expressing a desire to resolve the matter promptly.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, James Kamensky provides a proposed distribution breakdown based on total medical bills. The proposed figures are Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44; Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23; Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08; Daquan Graham: $3,379.25. He also presents a calculation showing totals such as Naomi Robinson: $32,754; a proportion of 0.307668781 yielding $15,383.43905; Ashlee Williams: $35,138.24; a proportion of 0.3300647087 yielding $16,503.23543; Julmonzhae Moore: $31,371.40; a proportion of 0.2946815777 yielding $14,734.07889; Daquan Graham: $7,195; a proportion of 0.06758493251 yielding $3,379.246626. Scott Stout later responds that he misread the situation and asks that the prior distribution be disregarded.\n\nAs the weeks progressed, further questions about underinsured coverage were addressed. On July 17, 2024, James Kamensky asks whether Naomi Robinson has underinsured coverage, noting \u201cUnderinsured? Naomi does not, see attached.\u201d The following day, Aaron Whaley replies that his side does not have access to any underinsured coverage either, and James indicates again that more time is needed to confer with the client and review medical billing.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, the thread clarifies the scope of representation: James Kamensky states, \u201cWe only rep Robinson and auth pending.\u201d Earlier that day, Aaron Whaley asks whether Kamensky\u2019s office has authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson, noting that he has authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and seeking confirmation regarding the other two claimants. The emails also include standard privilege notices.\n\nFinally, on August 2, 2024, Aaron Whaley writes that he knows James Kamensky rep Robinson and that he has emailed all counsel. He asks to be informed when authorization is obtained and asks Scott Stout whether he has had a chance to discuss authorization with Daquan. The chain ends with renewed emphasis on obtaining authorization and coordinating across all four claimants under Claim #: 054658453-01.\n\nThroughout the exchange, the parties reference university records and insurer communications, including the University of Louisville records (UL records) and POC considerations for UofL, with June 4, 2024, as an earlier touchpoint about providing a point of contact for UL records. The thread contains multiple firm signatures, addresses, and privilege notices, illustrating ongoing efforts to resolve authorization status and determine the allocation of any potential settlement among the four claimants.",

      "natural_language": "The case file is titled Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023, with client Ashlee Williams. The matter concerns four claimants listed in the subject line: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, associated with Claim number 054658453-01.\n\nThe first item in the recorded chain occurs on August 6, 2024, when Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed James Kamensky, Esq., and Ashlee Williams to check whether James had discussed the case with his client and obtained approval for a global settlement. The email asked for confirmation that a global settlement had been approved.\n\nA prior reply surfaced from August 1, 2024, in which James Kamensky stated that his firm \u201conly rep Robinson\u201d and that authorization was pending. Later that same day, Aaron Whaley sent a message to James asking for clarity on authorization: he stated that he had authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and asked whether James had authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson.\n\nThe exchange continued in mid-July 2024. On July 17, 2024 at 12:10 PM, James Kamensky replied in the chain that he would need a few days to confer with his client and to assess medical billing before providing a final answer. Earlier that day, at 12:09 PM, Aaron Whaley responded that he did not have access to any underinsured coverage either. Also on July 17, Aaron\u2019s message reflected that Naomi Robinson\u2019s underinsured coverage had been addressed in the thread, with James noting that Naomi does not have underinsured coverage and asking to see attached information.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, a phone-style thread included a proposed breakdown based on total medical bills. Aaron provided the following figures for the four claimants:\n- Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44\n- Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23\n- Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08\n- Daquan Graham: $3,379.25\n\nAccompanying the proposed numbers were a simple proportional breakdown using total billed amounts: Naomi Robinson with a billed amount of 32,754 (ratio 0.307668781) yielding 15,383.43905; Ashlee Williams with 35,138.24 (ratio 0.3300647087) yielding 16,503.23543; Julmonzhae Moore with 31,371.4 (ratio 0.2946815777) yielding 14,734.07889; and Daquan Graham with 7,195 (ratio 0.06758493251) yielding 3,379.246626. The exchange appears to have been an attempt to structure a settlement based on medical bill totals.\n\nEarlier, on July 12, 2024, Aaron had indicated that hospital records and billing were pending, but collateral source information showed total billed amounts of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic. He also asked about other claimants\u2019 specials, whether there was a significant injury, and what applicable underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage might apply. James had replied on the same day that collateral-source information was being reviewed and that hospital records and billing were pending, and he inquired about UL records and UIM considerations.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, Aaron had asked for updates on UL records, noting that more than five months had passed since limits were tendered. Earlier, on June 4, 2024, James had asked whether there was a good point of contact for University of Louisville (UofL) records so he could relay the information to his firm\u2019s records team.\n\nThroughout the thread, standard attorney-client and work-product privilege notices appeared in each email, indicating that the messages and any attachments were confidential and intended only for the named recipients. The communications also listed multiple recipients beyond the principal participants, including Robert Elliott, Lexi Graham, Scott Stout, and the Louisville Williams client, among others, and each message carried the accompanying confidentiality notice.\n\nBy August 1, 2024, the communications showed a narrowing of authority. James stated that his firm only represented Naomi Robinson and that authorization was pending. In the same week, Aaron confirmed that he had authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and asked whether James had authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson.\n\nFinally, on August 6, 2024, Aaron Whaley followed up with James Kamensky, asking whether James had had a chance to discuss the matter with his client and obtain approval for the global settlement. The message concluded with thanks.\n\nIn summary, the records reflect an ongoing effort between the Whaley Law Firm and James Kamensky, Esq., to determine authority to resolve individual claimants and to pursue a global settlement among four parties in Claim 054658453-01. The discussions spanned June through August 2024, covering issues of authority to settle, underinsured coverage, hospital billing and collateral sources, the status of UL records, and a proposed distribution of settlement funds based on total medical bills (with explicit dollar amounts for each claimant). The chain also includes notes about the status of the coverage, with Naomi Robinson not having underinsured coverage, and a recurring focus on obtaining client approvals for any global resolution.",

The client is Ashlee Williams, with co-claimants Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, under Claim Number 054658453-01.\n\nIn the communications thread, on August 6, 2024 at 2:39:21 PM Eastern, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed Scott Stout and Ashlee Williams. He asked, \u201cScott, have you had a chance to get the global offer to Daquan approved?\u201d\n\nEarlier, on March 13, 2024 at 2:44 PM, Scott Stout replied that \u201cDaquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted our bills.\u201d In his message, he provided the contact details for Stout & Heuke Law Office: 300 High Rise Drive, Suite 292, Louisville, KY 40213; telephone 502-966-3347; fax 502-966-9394. He also noted a Downtown Office located at 600 W. Main Street, 5th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202. The exchange also shows the sender\u2019s signature block and office information.\n\nAlso on March 13, 2024 at 2:41 PM, Aaron Whaley sent an email to Robert Elliott with Scott Stout and lgraham@kpattorney.comCc\u2019d, bearing the subject \u201cRe: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham / Claim#: 054658453-01.\u201d In that message, Whaley asked for updates and stated, \u201cAny updates on this? I think we are just waiting on Naomi Robinson to submit her medical bills.\u201d\n\nEarlier still, on March 6, 2024 at 7:48 AM, Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual sent an email addressed to the recipients associated with the file. The message began, \u201cHello,\u201d and asked, \u201cPlease advise if your offices have came to an agreement on the distribution of the global policy limit tender to your clients.\u201d The email included two images labeled as removed by the sender and was part of an outbound communication regarding the case. The metadata notes the claim number 054658453, Exposure-Number 01, Category Manual Outbound E-Mail, Description undefined, Template-Id BIFREEFORM. The notice also states that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the company address at 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116, and \u00a9 2024 Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.\n\nThe thread closes with the sign-offs for Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022. The document also repeats the Whaley firm\u2019s contact information and address blocks as part of the closing.\n\nIn summary, the case involves Ashlee Williams and co-claimants in a motor vehicle accident matter arising on August 29, 2023, with the ongoing discussion about the global policy limit, the submission of bills (notably Daquan Graham\u2019s), and the status of Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills, all tied to Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy and a global offer process.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. The client is Ashlee Williams, and the matter labeled for the file is Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham, Claim Number 054658453-01.\n\nThe correspondence in question centers on settlement discussions for the four claimants related to the motor vehicle accident. The chain begins with communications among Ashlee Williams\u2019s counsel and related counsel as they assess representation and authority to resolve the matter.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, James Kamensky, Esq., sent a message noting that hospital records and billing were still pending. He reported that collateral source information had been received showing total billed amounts of $26,554, plus $6,200 at a rehabilitation clinic. He asked for input on the other claimants\u2019 specials, whether any of the injuries were significant, and whether applicable underinsured motorist coverage (UIM) existed. The message included the heading for hospital and billing issues and referenced the four claimants.\n\nLater on July 12, 2024, in a following thread, James asked about the status of underinsured coverage for the claimants, indicating that Naomi Robinson did not have underinsured coverage, and he referenced an attachment. This was followed by further exchanges through July 15 and July 17 addressing authority to resolve different claimants and the status of insurance coverage.\n\nOn July 15, 2024 at 1:00 PM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm provided a proposed breakdown based on total medical bills for the four claimants:\n- Naomi Robinson: $15,383.44\n- Ashlee Williams: $16,503.23\n- Julmonzhae Moore: $14,734.08\n- Daquan Graham: $3,379.25\n\nHe included supporting figures in a line-item format showing the underlying numbers used to compute these totals (Naomi Robinson with a total of 32,754 and a factor of 0.307668781 producing 15,383.43905; Ashlee Williams with 35,138.24 and a factor of 0.3300647087 producing 16,503.23543; Julmonzhae Moore with 31,371.4 and a factor of 0.2946815777 producing 14,734.07889; Daquan Graham with 7,195 and a factor of 0.06758493251 producing 3,379.246626).\n\nAt 1:24 PM on July 15, 2024, Scott Stout (Stout & Heuke Law Office) replied: \u201cWait. I misread that. I see where I made the mistake. My apologies. Please disregard.\u201d This indicated a correction to the prior proposed figures or assumptions.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:55 AM, James Kamensky had asked whether Naomi Robinson\u2019s claim involved underinsured coverage and requested the attached documentation, indicating that Naomi might not have underinsured coverage and seeking confirmation on that point.\n\nOn July 17, 2024 at 12:09 PM, Aaron Whaley responded: \u201cWe do not have access to any under insured coverage either.\u201d At 12:10 PM, James Kamensky replied that he needed a few days to confer with his client and assess medical billing, but would let the other side know his position.\n\nAlso on July 17, 2024 at 12:10 PM, a prior message from James Kamensky indicated that they did not yet have complete authorization to resolve all four claimants, and that only Naomi Robinson was being represented with authorized settlement discussions pending for the others.\n\nOn August 1, 2024 at 1:41 PM, James Kamensky sent a message stating: \u201cWe only rep Robinson and auth pending.\u201d In a subsequent email, also on August 1, 2024 at 1:40 PM, Aaron Whaley asked: \u201cI have authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore. Do you have authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson?\u201d This exchange clarified that the sender had authority to settle Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, while Kamensky indicated authority was still pending for Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson.\n\nFinally, on August 6, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent a message to James Kamensky (copied to Ashlee Williams) asking whether Kamensky had a chance to discuss the matter with his client and obtain approval for a global settlement. James Kamensky replied shortly after that the matter was \u201cStill pending response.\u201d Ashlee Williams replied, acknowledging the update and adding that her clients were pressing to get this matter resolved.\n\nAdditional context appears in the signature blocks and contact details included in the chain. James Kamensky\u2019s firm lists multiple offices and addresses: 1320 Main Street, Ste 300, Columbia, SC 29201; 2100 Southbridge Parkway, Ste 650, Birmingham, AL 35209; 8888 Keystone Crossing, Suite 1300, Indianapolis, IN 46240; mailing address 925 S. Federal Hwy, 6th Floor, Boca Raton, FL 33432; and a general telephone number of 800-586-5555. The messages are marked as attorney\u2013client and/or work-product privileged, with standard confidentiality notices.\n\nIn summary, the case involves four claimants under claim number 054658453-01 (Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham) related to the MVA on August 29, 2023. The parties have been negotiating a global settlement, with representation and settlement authority for Naomi Robinson confirmed as partially in place and with authority still pending for Ashlee Williams\u2019s co-claimants. The discussion has included assessments of medical bills, collateral sources, and potential UIM considerations, and the latest communications in early August 2024 indicate that the clients\u2019 approval for a global settlement has not yet been obtained.",

The message was part of an active thread related to the case, which also references the same four individuals in the Re line.\n\nEarlier, on Tuesday, August 6, 2024 at 2:54 PM, Scott Stout replied, expressing frustration that he had not been able to reach the individual in question, stating that he was livid, that the phone did not work, and that a letter had been sent the previous week, with a promise to keep everyone posted.

Main Street, 5th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202.\n\nIn an earlier exchange on August 6, 2024 at 2:39 PM, Aaron asked Scott whether he had had a chance to get the global offer to Daquan approved, continuing the same theme of coordinating the matter.\n\nMoving back to March 13, 2024, at 2:44 PM, Scott Stout wrote that Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke had submitted their bills. His signature block again provides the office details: Stout & Heuke Law Office, 300 High Rise Drive, Suite 292, Louisville, KY 40213; phone 502-966-3347; fax 502-966-9394; Downtown Office at 600 W.

I think we are just waiting on Naomi Robinson to submit her medical bills.\u201d This indicates Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills were still outstanding at that time.\n\nEarlier, on March 6, 2024 at 7:48 AM, Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual Mutual Insurance (from the subject line and body) asked, \u201cHello, Please advise if your offices have came to an agreement on the distribution of the global policy limit tender to your clients.\u201d The thread includes a header indicating the message contained an image and metadata showing the claim number 054658453, the Exposure-Number 01, and that it was categorized as a Manual Outbound E-Mail with Template-Id BIFREEFORM. The message confirms Liberty Mutual as the policy underwriter, specifically Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, and includes standard company address noting 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116.\n\nThroughout these messages, the parties involved repeatedly reference the global offer/distribution of the policy limits and the submission of bills for Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson, with Daquan Graham\u2019s bills having been submitted by Daquan Graham/Stout & Heuke and Naomi Robinson\u2019s medical bills still pending as of March 13, 2024.

      "natural_language": "On August 13, 2024, in the case identified as Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023, concerning client Ashlee Williams and co-claimants Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham (Claim #: 054658453-01), a series of emails circulated among the parties\u2019 counsel. The subject line referenced the four claimants and the claim number, and the message was from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky. In the body of his message, he asked, \u201cGreat. James?\u201d and signed with his contact information, followed by copies to Scott Stout and other recipients, including Ashlee Williams and several attorney representatives. Scott Stout, identified as with Stout & Heuke Law Office, responded in a subsequent thread noting that he had authority to settle Daquan Graham, and he provided the firm\u2019s Louisville addresses and contact numbers for both the downtown and other offices, indicating an active participation in settlement discussions.\n\nEarlier communications, dating from August 1, 2024, reflect an inquiry about settlement authority: Aaron Whaley asked James Kamensky, Esq., whether James had authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson, while Aaron himself stated he had authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore. The August 1 message also included Aaron\u2019s sign-off with his firm\u2019s address and phone number.\n\nThe chain also shows substantial back-and-forth in July 2024 regarding authority and insurance coverage. On July 10, 2024, James Kamensky asked whether Naomi Robinson had underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage, noting that underinsured coverage appeared to be important and requesting a point of contact for UofL records. James added that Naomi did not appear to have underinsured coverage, and he attached related materials. Aaron Whaley replied on July 15, 2024 that there was no access to any underinsured coverage either. James then acknowledged the point but indicated he needed a few days to confer with the client and assess medical billing. Scott Stout subsequently chimed in on July 15, clarifying that he had misread something and asked that the previous message be disregarded.\n\nIn the same July 15, 2024 window, Aaron Whaley provided a proposed breakdown of the settlements based on total medical bills. He listed the following allocations: Naomi Robinson $15,383.44; Ashlee Williams $16,503.23; Julmonzhae Moore $14,734.08; and Daquan Graham $3,379.25. He presented the underlying figures underlying these allocations, showing the raw totals used for each claimant (Naomi Robinson 32,754; Ashlee Williams 35,138.24; Julmonzhae Moore 31,371.4; Daquan Graham 7,195) and the calculated shares (0.307668781 for Naomi, 0.3300647087 for Ashlee, 0.2946815777 for Julmonzhae, and 0.06758493251 for Daquan), which produced the final dollar amounts cited.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on July 12, 2024, Aaron Whaley wrote \u201cCircling back on this. Would like to get this resolved as soon as possible.\u201d James Kamensky followed with an update indicating that hospital records and billing were pending, but collateral source information showed total billed amounts of $26,554 plus $6,200 at a rehab clinic, and he asked about specials for the other claimants, whether there had been significant injuries, and whether UIM would apply. Aaron\u2019s response reaffirmed a sense of urgency to resolve the matter, while James\u2019s prior messages underscored the need to verify medical billing and collateral sources. The July 12 exchange also included the standard attorney\u2013client privilege notices typical of such communications.\n\nBefore these exchanges, James Kamensky had asked in June 2024 whether the team had a good point of contact for the University of Louisville records, indicating that he would relay the matter to their records team. This shows ongoing coordination with medical providers and institutions as part of evaluating the case's settlement value and collateral sources.\n\nOverall, the record captures an ongoing effort through mid-2024 to negotiate settlements among multiple claimants, determine authority to settle each individual claim, assess underinsured coverage and collateral sources, and finalize a proportional distribution of settlement proceeds based on the total medical bills. By August 13, 2024, Scott Stout stated he had authority to settle Daquan Graham, and Aaron Whaley followed with a prompt to involve James Kamensky on related authority matters, signaling continued progress toward resolving the four-claim file. The communications include standard privileged notices and reflect the professional interactions among the counsel and the clients involved.",

Re: Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, Naomi Robinson, Daquan Graham / Claim#: 054658453-01.\n\nAn email thread dated from July through September 2024 circulated between Ashlee Williams\u2019s counsel and opposing firm personnel regarding authority to resolve or settle claims for the four individuals and efforts to locate Naomi Robinson. The thread began with a July 17, 2024, message from James Kamensky, Esq., in response to prior discussions: he needed a few days to confer with the client and assess medical billing before advising. \n\nOn August 1, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm responded that he had authority to resolve Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, and he asked whether James Kamensky had authority to resolve Daquan Graham and Naomi Robinson. James\u2019s reply and ongoing statements about authority followed in subsequent messages. \n\nOn August 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM, James Kamensky wrote that he would reach out to Ethics counsel to determine options, noting that Naomi was unresponsive through all means and that Ethics counsel could not be reached. Earlier that day, at 12:02 PM, Kamensky had written, \u201cAs soon as I have authority I will advise.\u201d At 12:00 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, \u201cGreat. James?\u201d There is also a message from August 13, 2024, at approximately 11:51 AM from Scott Stout, stating, \u201cI have authority to settle Daquan Graham,\u201d from Stout & Heuke Law Office.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, at 11:26 AM, Aaron Whaley provided Naomi Robinson\u2019s address: 3420 Deibel Way, Louisville, KY 40220, and two phone numbers: 502-494-4885 (listed in Larry Robinson's name) and 502-494-4488 (listed in Courtney Ishmael's name).\n\nOn August 21, 2024, at 1:22 PM, James Kamensky wrote that contact letters had been sent and that Naomi had not been reachable at any of the listed numbers. On August 27, 2024, at 1:19 PM, Kamensky stated that an investigator was on the file but that if Whaley had a very reliable contact, they would appreciate the additional outreach. In reply, Aaron Whaley, on August 27, 2024, at 1:09 PM, noted that he used an investigator to track people down in situations like this, offered to provide the investigator\u2019s information or to have the investigator track Naomi down directly.\n\nThe August\u2013September period also included a September 11, 2024, 11:20 AM message from Aaron Whaley to James Kamensky and Ashlee Williams asking, \u201cJames, any luck? Thanks.\u201d\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications included standard privileged notices indicating the attorney-client and/or work-product confidential nature of the material. The participants included Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and James Kamensky, Esq., with Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office also appearing in the exchange, and Ashlee Williams was consistently copied. The signature blocks in the messages show Kamensky\u2019s firm maintaining multiple office locations (Columbia, SC; Birmingham, AL; Indianapolis, IN; and Boca Raton, FL) and contact details as part of the exchange.",

Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com), sent an email to State Farm Claims (statefarmclaims@statefarm.com) concerning the motor vehicle accident case Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. The client listed in the case is Ashlee Williams, with the claimants identified in the message as Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore (1455R002D). The email originated from Bryce Koon, and the message was addressed to Mr. Lovato. The correspondence was also cc\u2019d to three Filevine project email addresses for the claimants: Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023, and Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023, with their respective Filevine addresses.\n\nIn the body of the email, the sender opened with a greeting to Mr. Lovato and stated that attached are the demands for the clients. He noted that there is a link to relevant documents in this regard, along with a recording from a witness. He explained that the enclosed demands specify individual amounts for each claimant, with the total exceeding $100,000. Consequently, if State Farm\u2019s policy limits are $100,000 or less, the firm requested that the insurer tender the full policy limits in a global settlement, with the proceeds then apportioned among the clients accordingly. He invited any questions and provided a Dropbox link for the documents and recording: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/otcrqef6shjlsber1d8pj/ABNqT2bx967085zNWZVjxvU?rlkey=fxljz2gciid3j1fw0hhpgpdzf&st=u0qqshno&dl=0.\n\nThe message closed with the sender\u2019s courtesy and signature: \u201cThank you, W.

The subject line was Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157). In the body of the message, Bryce attached Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery along with the associated notice filed that day, and he noted that a Word copy was included for convenience. He invited any questions and closed with his signature and contact information for The Whaley Law Firm, including the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone number (502) 365-5043; and fax number (502) 237-3207. The CC list included Sarena Tuttle; Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (AshleeWilliamsMVAZ3887726@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com); Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (DewayneWardMVAZ3888219@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com); Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (JulmonzhaeMooreMVAZ3887733@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com); and Janet Weile (Janet.Weile@skofirm.com). The message contained the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer typical of electronic correspondence.\n\nLater, on May 19, 2025 at 1:43:26 PM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon replied: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, July 7th is fine with me. If you need anything else from me, please let me know.\u201d This message again carried Bryce\u2019s professional signature and the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 10:08 AM, Zachary Reichle of SKO sent a separate email to counsel requesting an extension: \u201cGood morning, counsel, May we have an additional thirty days to finalize Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests? Currently, the responses are due June 4th. With the additional thirty days, the responses would become due July 7th (thirty days from June 4th lands on July 4th and the following two days are the weekend).\u201d He signed with his contact information (Associate, SKO), and the message included SKO\u2019s confidentiality notice. The email thread shows further that SKO\u2019s communications continued to include standard privilege and confidentiality provisions.\n\nIn sum, the record shows:\n- May 5, 2025: Bryce Koon transmitted Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery and a notice, attached as well as a Word copy, to opposing counsel and cc\u2019d recipients, including filevine addresses for Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore, plus Janet Weile, with Bryce\u2019s firm details and a standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n- May 19, 2025 (1:43 PM): Bryce indicated that July 7th was acceptable.\n- May 19, 2025 (approx. 10:08 AM): Zach Reichle requested a 30-day extension to July 7 for Defendant\u2019s discovery responses, explaining the calculation around weekends and the June 4 deadline. His message also included his SKO contact details and a confidentiality notice.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. Client: Ashlee Williams. The Willaims, Ward & Moore v. Robinson matter involves plaintiffs Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, and Dewayne Ward, with Naomi Robinson as the defendant.\n\nIn the June 9, 2025 email chain, Lesly Torres, a paralegal based in Indianapolis (direct line 317.61.4224; City: Indianapolis), sent a message to Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm with the subject Willaims, Ward & Moore v. Robinson. She attached copies of six discovery requests, served that day in Word and PDF formats, directed to the three plaintiffs. The requests were: 1) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams; 2) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams; 3) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore; 4) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore; 5) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward; and 6) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward. The message invited any questions and was cc'd to Zachary Reichle, Dennis Cantrell, and Janet Weile.\n\nOn July 15, 2025, Zachary Reichle, an Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, wrote to counsel regarding the status of the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses. He noted that the responses were originally due July 9, but no responses had been received and no extensions of time had been requested. His message included his contact information and the firm\u2019s confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on July 28, 2025, The Whaley Law Firm forwarded the matter to the same recipients with the subject Willaims, Ward & Moore v. Robinson. In this forwarded message, Bryce Koon advised that Plaintiffs' Discovery Responses were attached and provided a Dropbox link to the document production: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/f27jsukejdzuxesqz496o/AOngUDwjYgN8Y2nRHEIpqrU?rlkey=fje64jsp5o4uw5m4tasky5vw7&st=q3oemih1&dl=0. The email included Bryce Koon\u2019s signature and The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details, as well as a standard confidentiality notice stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not use or forward the information. The message was sent to Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23 file addresses and other related Filevine project emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157). The matter is a motor vehicle collision case filed on August 29, 2023, naming three plaintiffs: Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore. The current communications concern scheduling and discovery in the case, with counsel from The Whaley Law Firm representing the plaintiffs and Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC representing the defense. The plaintiffs\u2019 file includes Filevine project email addresses for each client: Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023, and Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023, along with Janet Weile on the defense side.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent counsel a message to Zachary Reichle of SKO (with Dennis Cantrell and the three Filevine addresses copied) attaching Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery, including a Word copy for convenience, and inviting questions if any arose. The message was part of the ongoing discovery process and carried the usual attorney-client confidentiality notice typical of such electronic communications.\n\nA few weeks later, on May 19, 2025, Reichle requested an extension to finalize the defense responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, asking for an additional thirty days. He noted that the current due date was June 4, and that extending thirty days would push the response due date to July 7 (since June 4 plus thirty days would land on July 4, with the following weekend days). Bryce Koon replied later that day, confirming that July 7 would be acceptable. The exchange also displayed the parties\u2019 standard contact details for The Whaley Law Firm and SKO, and included the same confidentiality notice.\n\nIn a later thread, Reichle referenced a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026, and indicated that he believed the parties had agreed to Larry Church as mediator at the Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025. He proposed that, if acceptable to the plaintiffs\u2019 office, they could contact Larry Church\u2019s office to determine his availability. He cautioned that the defense team was booked throughout January and early February of the following year, making mediation likely to occur in late February or March, but he did not anticipate any issue with the Court given that trial is not set until December 2026. This message also contained Reichle\u2019s signature block with his role as Associate at SKO and contact information, and reaffirmed the confidentiality notice.\n\nLater, on October 17, 2025, Reichle again reached out to request the scheduling of Plaintiffs\u2019 depositions and asked for the plaintiffs\u2019 availability in November or December. He also reiterated the January 31, 2026 mediation deadline and the use of Larry Church as mediator, referencing the July 29, 2025 Case Management Conference where that mediator arrangement was noted. He warned of limited availability in January and early February and indicated that late February or March would likely be required for mediation, while expressing that this would not be a problem for the Court since trial remains set for December 2026.\n\nFinally, on October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that the plaintiffs were available for depositions on any date within November 3\u20137, 2025, and invited the defense to select a date within that window to proceed with scheduling. He included his professional contact information and reaffirmed the standard confidentiality notices that accompany such correspondence.\n\nIn sum, the case involves three plaintiffs in a Floyd County motor vehicle collision matter, with discovery ongoing and a schedule that includes an extension to discovery responses (defense due July 7, 2025), a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 with Larry Church as mediator (to be confirmed with his office), and a depositions window for the plaintiffs set for November 3\u20137, 2025, as the parties work toward finalizing discovery and mediation in advance of a trial not set until December 2026.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157), counsel engaged in coordinating depositions for the plaintiffs\u2014Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore\u2014who are clients in this motor vehicle accident case filed on August 29, 2023. The correspondence began with W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and involved Zachary Reichle, Esq., an associate at Skofirm, along with several other recipients and Filevine project email addresses linked to the three clients. The exchanges also included Janet Weile of Skofirm and a standard attorney-client confidentiality notice on each message.\n\nThe scheduling discussion began with a May 19, 2025 email in which Bryce Koon indicated that July 7 would work for him and invited any further needs or information. This initial exchange set the stage for later deposition planning, though the concrete scheduling discussion would resume later in the year.\n\nOn October 17, 2025, Zach Reichle asked counsel to provide the plaintiffs\u2019 availability in November or December for depositions. He also noted a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and stated that the parties were agreeable to Larry Church as mediator at the Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025. Reichle explained that, due to prior bookings in January and early February, mediation would likely take place in late February or March, although he expected this would not be an issue for the Court given that trial was not set until December 2026. He concluded by thanking counsel.\n\nBryce Koon replied on October 22, 2025, informing Reichle that his clients were available for depositions on any date during November 3 through November 7, and asking to be advised which dates would work so scheduling could proceed.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Reichle responded that November 6 and 7 would work for his office. He proposed scheduling all three depositions consecutively, from 9:00 a.m. to Noon on November 7, but said there was no issue with holding the depositions on separate days if necessary.\n\nA subsequent message from Bryce Koon on October 29, 2025 at 1:08 p.m. reiterated that his clients were available for depositions on any date during November 3 through November 7. He asked that, if any of those dates would work, Reichle\u2019s side should inform him so they could get things scheduled.\n\nLater that same day, at 1:43 p.m., Bryce wrote that he had confirmed with Ms. Moore and Ms. Williams that they were available on November 7. He noted that Ms. Moore works that afternoon, so he suggested starting with her deposition. He added that Mr. Ward had said he would inform him by tomorrow whether he would be available on November 7, and he pledged to relay any updates as soon as he received them. Bryce\u2019s message also included the standard confidentiality disclaimer and the email signature for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 1:49 p.m., Reichle replied: the plan was to issue notices for Ms. Moore\u2019s deposition beginning at 9:00 a.m. on November 7, with Ms. Williams\u2019s deposition to follow at 11:00 a.m. He added that Mr. Ward was available the week of November 10 if November 7 did not work for him.\n\nThe thread, which includes CC\u2019d recipients such as Dennis Cantrell and the Filevine project addresses for Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore, as well as Janet Weile at Skofirm, reflects a concerted effort across counsel to finalize the deposition schedule. The messages also contain standard attorney-confidentiality notices.\n\nIn summary, the parties are coordinating depositions for Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, and Dewayne Ward in the Williams-Ward-Moore v. Robinson case. The tentative plan, settled by communications in late October 2025, was to hold Ms. Moore\u2019s deposition first on November 7 beginning at 9:00 a.m., followed by Ms. Williams\u2019s deposition at 11:00 a.m., with Mr. Ward\u2019s availability to be determined if November 7 proved unsuitable for him. The clients\u2019 overall availability was framed around the November 3\u20137 window, with broader availability discussed for the week of November 10 if needed, and a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026, with Larry Church proposed as mediator and mediation possibly pushed to late February or March 2026 due to scheduling constraints.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023. Client: Ashlee Williams. Re: Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157).\n\nThe record consists of a sequence of email exchanges between counsel regarding scheduling depositions in the case Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson. The involved parties include W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, along with the named plaintiffs Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore, whose MVA claims occurred on 8/29/2023. The CC list in the emails includes Dennis Cantrell and Janet Weile, as well as filevine project email addresses for Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore, plus a filevine contact for Janet Weile. The emails also include standard attorney-client confidentiality notices.\n\nThe first substantive thread in the record, dated October 17, 2025, shows Zach Reichle requesting the availability of the plaintiffs for depositions in November or December. He also notes a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and that the parties had agreed to Larry Church as mediator at the Case Management Conference on July 29, 2025. Reichle explains that their office is booked throughout January and early February of the following year, so mediation would likely be scheduled for late February or March. He adds that this scheduling should not present an issue for the Court, given that trial is not set to occur until December 2026, but he asks to be notified of the office\u2019s position.\n\nA subsequent email, dated October 22, 2025, from Bryce Koon confirms that his clients are available for depositions on any date during November 3\u20137, 2025, and asks that if any of those dates work, they can get the scheduling set.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Reichle replies that November 6 and November 7 work for his office. He asks whether scheduling all three depositions consecutively would be feasible, proposing 9:00 a.m. to noon on November 7 as an option. He also notes that they have no issue with holding the depositions on separate days if necessary.\n\nOn October 29, 2025, Bryce Koon follows up with a reply confirming that the plaintiffs are available for depositions on the 7th. He indicates that Julmonzhae Moore and Ashlee Williams are available, with Moore\u2019s availability in the afternoon, so it would be best to start with her deposition first. He states that Mr. Ward would let him know by tomorrow whether he will be available on November 7 and promises to inform the recipient as soon as he hears back.\n\nIn addition to these scheduling emails, the record contains earlier correspondence from May 2025. A May 5, 2025 message from Bryce Koon to Dennis Cantrell and Zach Reichle is present, but its content is truncated in the record. A May 19, 2025 email from Zach Reichle requests an additional thirty days to finalize Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, explaining that the current due date was June 4 and proposing a new due date of July 7 to accommodate the extension, noting that June 4 plus thirty days would land on July 4 and the following two days were the weekend. A reply from Zach\u2019s counterpart on May 19, 2025 at 1:43 p.m. states, \u201cJuly 7th is fine.\u201d The May 19, 2025 10:08 a.m. email from Zach Reichle further documents the same discovery-extension discussion and reiterates his contact details and confidentiality notices.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discuss aligning deposition timing with anticipated mediation, considering preferences for the order and pacing of depositions, and ensuring that the plaintiffs\u2019 availability accommodates multiple depositions within the proposed windows. The plan evolving from the communications is to proceed with depositions in early November 2025, prioritizing Julmonzhae Moore for the first deposition given her afternoon work schedule, with Ashlee Williams and Dewayne Ward to follow, contingent on Ward\u2019s confirmation of his availability for November 7.\n\nAll communications in the record include standard confidentiality language indicating that the messages are intended only for the named recipients and may contain privileged information; recipients are advised not to disclose or forward the content if received in error. The sender details and firm affiliations appeared consistently, with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information listed for Bryce Koon and Stoll Keenon Ogden LLP\u2019s contact information listed for Zach Reichle, alongside the affected clients and CC recipients.",

      "natural_language": "This case concerns the Moore/Williams depositions in the Ashlee Williams MVA matter (Ashlee-Williams-MVA-08-29-2023). On November 13, 2025 at 5:27:05 GMT-05:00, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, circulated an email to opposing counsel regarding deposition scheduling. He emailed Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, and copied three Filevine project email addresses: Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023, and Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023. In the message, Koon requested dates for his client\u2019s deposition and stated that Dewayne Ward\u2019s deposition would be scheduled for the same day. The email included Koon\u2019s firm contact information (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207) and carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThe chronology also shows earlier correspondence on November 6, 2025. At 11:54 AM, Bryce Koon sent a message to Zachary Reichle and Dennis Cantrell asking whether they had the Zoom link for tomorrow\u2019s deposition, intending to ensure his clients were prepared. Later that same day, Reichle replied (at 12:10 PM) that the reporter had confirmed the depositions would proceed as scheduled and that a calendar invite with the Zoom link would be emailed shortly, which they would forward once available. Reichle provided the Zoom access details: Join Zoom Meeting https://stewartrichardson.zoom.us/j/81627086306?pwd=beXeD9HWwYbPQ9aVXcVoZd4CnKxuFN.1, Dial-in: 1 312 626 6799, Meeting ID: 816 2708 6306, Passcode: 462204.
