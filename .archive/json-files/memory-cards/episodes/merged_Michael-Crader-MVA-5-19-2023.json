We had to hire out the input of waterline because with Mike?s injury to his back he was unable to put the waterline in himself. The cost of the waterline was $10,800. Mikes was hoping that his back injury would be healed so we could put the fence in but as of today, October 6, 2023 he is still hurting. With the fence unable to be constructed we had to purchase additional hay to feed our cattle. The field that was unable to be fenced produces approximately 500 rolls worth of feed for cattle. With the drought we only could secure 463 bales of hay at $55 a bale totaling $25,465 to offset the cattle unable to graze on the unfenced field due to the injury caused by the accident on May 19,2023. This does not take into account all the additional projects and maintenance that need to be done on the farm that we are unable to do due to Mike?s injury.

I advised that we are still attempting service on the defendant. The client stated that he sees her everyday at the same house, but I advised him that per the Initial Service Results she no longer lives there. We ran a search and confirmed the defendant has a new address, though the client does not believe the defendant has moved. We discussed the service process and all possible outcomes. I reassured the client that liability had been accepted; however, the passengers in the at-fault vehicle also have a right to make a claim, and their time frame to do so is two years from the date of the incident. While we hope litigation will help speed up the process, we cannot force BI to disregard the SOL. The client's wife expressed understanding and appreciated the update and explanation.",

      "natural_language": "Initial client contact on July 31, 2024, with Michael Crader regarding the Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023 case. The client’s voicemail was received. BK completed Check Svc Task Prior to POS, and I reviewed the case in CourtNet. No POS has been uploaded. The response filed on 07/19/2024 was noted, but the document had not been uploaded. I called the Clerk, who emailed a handwritten Answer to the Complaint, which I reviewed, and then I spoke with the client.\n\nI explained that Defendants Combs have been served, but the Sheriff did not send in POS to the Court. I advised that Def Combs filed a handwritten Answer and noted that, while liability is not our current issue, Def Combs did admit to improper passing. I advised that we will send the handwritten Answer to BI for proper counsel to be appointed. I explained to the client that our present issue concerns her mother’s injuries and her mother’s right to a portion of the Policy Limits. The client stated that the mother was driving, not Def Combs, but I noted that this distinction is not central at the moment. The mother’s entitlement to a portion of the BI Policy due to injuries is our hold up, and the mother needs to make a claim or waive the right to claim. I advised the client that hopefully once proper DC is appointed, DC can address the situation with Def and determine whether the mother will make a claim. The client expressed understanding.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Louise M. Stevenson, Paralegal Specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of General Counsel (Revenue Law Group), sent an email to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. In her message she thanked Sarena for the current status and reported that the VA’s claim for Michael Crader, tied to the date of injury of May 19, 2023 (DOI: 5/19/2023), remains at $86,505.91. Stevenson noted that if Sarena possesses the fax sent on April 18, 2024, the claim has not changed. She provided the ECFax delivery details for that April 18, 2024 fax: the fax was delivered successfully. The Job/Fax ID was 4b79b51e-4a15-4ba9-8bbe-87e0327b0de5, and the sender's ECFax account was Office of General Counsel. The originating fax number was 1-480-907-1910, the destination fax number was 150-236-49363, the transmission lasted 448 seconds, and the fax contained 12 pages. The subject line was \"Claim Asserted - ATTY - Crader.\" The fax was submitted on April 18, 2024 at 12:51:07 EDT and delivered at 13:00:39 EDT. Stevenson signed off with her contact information, noting her title and role, and including her office hours (M-F, 8:00 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.) and the general caution about handling veteran PII and the preferred method of communication. The email also contained the standard caution about privileged and confidential information and a series of links and notices related to VA resources, including reminders about updated contact channels and PII safeguards, and references to the GCLAWS number associated with the case.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on December 30, 2024, Sarena Tuttle had written to Stevenson regarding the same case. She stated that Mr. Crader’s claim was currently in litigation and that a settlement was not anticipated any time soon. She advised Stevenson to diary an approximate 180 days, explaining that the case was in the written discovery phase and would require completion of the oral discovery phase before any settlement discussions could begin. Tuttle also requested an updated itemized ledger detailing each provider and service billed on the lien for review of relatedness. Tuttle signed as: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222). Her direct line was (502) 357-9971, her office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104, and her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nEarlier that same day, Stevenson had written for a status update on Michael Crader’s case (DOI: 5/19/2023). She reported that the VA’s claim remained $86,505.91 and urged that any questions be directed to her, noting that billing requests should not be faxed to the new intake fax lines. She provided her contact information again (IPhone: 317-361-6278; Fax: 202-495-5041; hours M-F 8:00 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.) and reminded the recipient to reference the GCLAWS number in correspondence. The message included the same standard privacy and confidentiality notices and the same links to VA resources, along with the admonition that fax numbers on the VA’s public website have changed and should be verified before sending requests to the correct fax number. The signature block listed her formal role, department, and case assignments (Lexington, Louisville, Mountain Home, New Orleans; Mass Litigation), and repeated the same contact details.\n\nIn addition to the above, the message thread contained general administrative notes: a reminder that for new third-party billing requests, information could be found on the VA’s website under the VA Federal Medical Care Recovery Program and instructions for requesting medical bills and records (collections.asp). For NEW CHAMPVA billing requests, the notice directed sending requests to VHA Community Care, P.O. Box 469062 741/04, Denver, CO 80246-9062, with Fax # 303-398-5116. It also pointed out resources for veterans to download their own health records (myhealth.va.gov) and other VA resources (vets.gov). The “HOW WAS OUR SERVICE TODAY?” section warned that VA fax numbers on the public site have changed and recommended double-checking the site to ensure requests are faxed to the correct numbers (collections.asp). The note reiterated that the VA Subrogation process involves requesting VA medical bills and that fax numbers have changed.\n\nIn summary, the file status shows the VA claim for Michael Crader related to the May 19, 2023 injury remains at $86,505.91 as of early 2025, with the April 18, 2024 fax having been delivered and containing twelve pages. The case is in litigation with no anticipated settlement in the near term, and the parties are in the process of discovery, with an expected diary of about 180 days before settlement discussions. The parties continue to exchange requests for documentation, including an itemized ledger of billed providers and services, and both sides are reminded to use the correct contact channels and up-to-date fax numbers when communicating.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader. Re: 596-C-20240108-14823/GCL #541090/Crader.\n\nIn a communication thread beginning on December 30, 2024, Louise M. Stevenson, Paralegal Specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel (Revenue Law Group), requested a current status on Michael Crader’s case, noting the date of injury as 5/19/2023. She stated that the VA’s claim in Crader’s case remained $86,505.91 and advised that, for questions regarding this existing case, all inquiries should be directed to her rather than faxing billing requests to the NEW intake fax lines. She also provided her contact details and emphasized that this was not a new case.\n\nThat same day, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded. She confirmed that Crader’s claim is currently in litigation and that the firm did not anticipate a settlement in the near term. She advised diarying approximately 180 days, explaining that the parties are in the written discovery phase and would need to complete the oral discovery phase before any settlement discussions could begin. She also requested, in the meantime, an updated itemized ledger reflecting each provider and service billed on the lien for review regarding relatedness. She signed with her Whaley Law Firm contact information and noted her new email address.\n\nOn December 30, 2024, at 10:03 a.m. (ET), Stevenson replied with a reiteration of the current status request: a current status on Crader’s case (DOI: 5/19/2023) and the reminder that the VA’s claim remains $86,505.91. She reiterated that questions should be directed to her and advised against faxing billing requests to the new intake fax lines, given that this is an existing case.\n\nThe thread includes additional corporate communications and standard VA service disclosures typical of Stevenson’s messages, including:\n- references to the VA’s collections resources and relevant links;\n- guidance on where to send new CHAMPVA and third-party billing requests;\n- reminders that veterans can access and download their health records via the VA portals;\n- a reminder that fax numbers on the VA public site have changed and should be verified before sending requests.\n\nLater, on January 2, 2025, at 2:58 p.m. (ET), Stevenson again provided Crader’s case status. She stated that the VA’s claim regarding Crader (DOI: 5/19/2023) was still $86,505.91 and added that if the recipient possessed the fax sent on April 18, 2024, then the claim amount had not changed. She provided the EcFax status as Delivered Successfully and included the fax delivery details: Job/Fax ID 4b79b51e-4a15-4ba9-8bbe-87e0327b0de5, originating fax number 14809071910, destination fax number 15023649363, duration of 448 seconds, total pages 12, subject “Claim Asserted - ATTY - Crader,” with submission on 04/18/2024 12:51:07 EDT and delivery on 04/18/2024 13:00:39 EDT. Stevenson signed with her professional details and additional guidance about VA resources and contact practices for this case.\n\nShortly after, at 3:03 p.m. on January 2, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied, thanking Stevenson for the update but noting that she did not see an itemized ledger in Crader’s file. She requested that the VA send over the itemized ledger, stating that its absence was a deficiency and that she would greatly appreciate receiving it. Her message concluded with her standard Whaley Law Firm contact details and her updated email address.\n\nIn summary, the essential facts remain: Michael Crader’s VA claim for this case (DOI 5/19/2023) is consistently reported as $86,505.91. The case is in litigation with an anticipated diary window of about 180 days for discovery phases before settlement discussions. An April 18, 2024 fax transmission related to the claim was delivered, containing 12 pages and a subject line indicating “Claim Asserted - ATTY - Crader.” The most recent communications include a request for an itemized ledger documenting providers and services billed on the lien, which has not yet been provided, and a confirmation of the current status from the VA.",

Stevenson, a Paralegal Specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of General Counsel, Revenue Law Group, sent an email to Sarena Tuttle regarding Michael Crader. In her message she stated that the billing ledger is attached to the record for Michael Crader and that the password to open the file was sent in a previous email. Stevenson signed her message with her full title and contact information, and she included the standard privileged and confidential notices. She noted that the message is intended only for the addressee and may contain privileged information, and requested that if the email was received in error, the recipient should notify her, delete the message, and not disseminate or copy it. She reminded the recipient to reference the GCLAWS number associated with the case in the email subject line and correspondence when referring to the client.\n\nIn addition to the immediate attachment update, Stevenson’s message included a series of guidance and resources related to VA billing and records. She directed that for new third-party billing requests, the VA’s website provide information on the VA Federal Medical Care Recovery Program and on requesting medical bills and records, supplying a link: https://www.va.gov/ogc/collections.asp. For new CHAMPVA billing requests, she instructed sending the request directly to VHA Community Care, P.O. Box 469062 741/04, Denver, CO 80246-9062, with a fax number of 303/398-5116.

Stevenson added guidance about how veterans can view and download their records and noted that the VA’s fax numbers on the public website have changed, advising double-checking https://www.va.gov/ogc/collections.asp to ensure requests are sent to the correct fax number, and she specifically referenced VA Subrogation – Request VA Medical Bills along with the reminder that the fax numbers have changed. The message also included those reminders about updated fax numbers and directing readers to the VA collections site.\n\nLater the same day, on Thursday, January 2, 2025, at 3:04 p.m., Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded to Stevenson. She wrote, “Awesome! Thank you for the update. Unfortunately, I do not see an itemized ledger in the file. If you could send that over, that would be greatly appreciated.” Tuttle’s signature identified her as with The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971, main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting this is her new email address).",

Mr. Crader's Claim is currently in litigation. We do not anticipate settlement any time soon. Please diary out approximately 180 days as we are currently in the written discovery phase and we will have to conclude the oral discovery phase before any settlement discussion will begin.\n However, in the meantime, can you please provide an updated itemized ledger reflecting each provider & service billed on this lien for review for relatedness?\n\nSarena M. Tuttle\nLitigation Paralegal &\nWorkers' Compensation Case Manager\nThe Whaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Lane\nLouisville, KY 40222\nD: (502) 357-9971\nO: (502) 583-4022 ext 104\nE: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\n(PL",
      "natural_language": "The case is Michael Crader’s motor vehicle accident from May 19, 2023 (MVA 5-19-2023), identified as 596-C-20240108-14823/GCL #541090/Crader, with the client being Michael Crader. The matter involves the VA’s subrogation interests and medical bills related to Crader’s care.\n\nIn late December 2024, The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena M. Tuttle notified Louise Stevenson, a Paralegal Specialist with the VA Office of General Counsel Revenue Law Group, that Crader’s claim was currently in litigation. She stated that settlement was not anticipated in the near term and requested that Crader’s team “diary out approximately 180 days” since the case was in written discovery and would need to conclude the oral discovery phase before any settlement discussions could begin. She further asked for an updated itemized ledger reflecting each provider and service billed on the lien for relatedness.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Sarena followed up to confirm status. In a message sent at 3:04 PM (external), she thanked Louise for the update but noted that she did not see an itemized ledger in the file she had received and requested that it be sent over.\n\nEarlier on January 2, 2025, at about 2:58 PM, Louise Stevenson had replied to Sarena. She stated that the VA’s claim regarding Michael Crader, DOI May 19, 2023, remained $86,505.91. She added that if the recipient possessed the fax sent on April 18, 2024, the claim amount would be the same as no changes had occurred. Stevenson provided the details of a transmitted fax: EC Fax status was “Delivered Successfully.” The fax had Job/Fax ID 4b79b51e-4a15-4ba9-8bbe-87e0327b0de5, originated from the ECFax account “Office of General Counsel,” with Originating Fax Number 14809071910 and Destination Fax Number 15023649363. The transmission lasted 448 seconds and consisted of 12 pages. The subject was “Claim Asserted - ATTY - Crader.” It was submitted on April 18, 2024 at 12:51:07 EDT and delivered at 13:00:39 EDT.\n\nStevenson’s signature followed, reiterating her role and contact details as a Paralegal Specialist with the VA Office of General Counsel, Revenue Law Group, including phone numbers and hours (Mon–Fri, 8:00 a.m.–4:30 p.m.), and her email address Louise.Stevenson@va.gov. She included standard cautions about using secured/encrypted mail for veteran PII, referencing the GCLAWS number associated with Crader’s case in subject lines and correspondence, and a confidentiality notice. She also provided links for new third-party billing (the VA Federal Medical Care Recovery Program) and Champ VA billing, and noted resources for veterans to access and download their own health records via myhealth.va.gov, as well as other VA resources.\n\nIn the body of the January 2, 2025 correspondence, Stevenson reminded recipients that the file to be sent would be password protected and that she would not include the password in the email itself or in the subject line. She instructed the recipient to use the password 596-C-20240108-14823 to open the file and explained that the ledger would contain multiple tabs at the bottom, with “X” marks indicating care a veteran received in the community, and that the separate tab would provide a further breakdown for the community care. She noted that the password would not be included in the subject line or body of the email, and advised that if the file was not received that day, the recipient should contact her the following day, as some attorneys’ computer systems block password-protected files. She emphasized that unless the recipient explicitly told them they did not receive the email, they would not know that the file had not been received.\n\nAdditionally, Stevenson’s January 2, 2025 message included standard “How Was Our Service Today?” language and a reminder that fax numbers on the VA’s public website have changed, directing readers to verify the correct fax numbers at the VA’s collections page. She closed with the usual notices about VA subrogation, the need to request VA medical bills, and the updated fax numbers.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the case’s GCLAWS number and the need to address Crader’s lien and related medical bills. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details were repeatedly provided (Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager; Louisville, KY), and Stevenson’s communications consistently urged secure handling of PII and adherence to VA processes and contact protocols.\n\nIn summary, the Crader case remains in litigation with the latest stated claim amount of $86,505.91 as of January 2, 2025, and the parties are awaiting an itemized ledger detailing each provider and service billed on the lien for relatedness. A password-protected digitized ledger was being prepared for transmission, with explicit instructions on protecting PII and navigating the password and multi-tab format, along with follow-up steps if the file was not received.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader. This motor vehicle accident case involves Michael Crader and communications with The Whaley Law Firm in late 2024 and early 2025 regarding discovery responses, damages, and case status.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Michael Crader sent an email to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) with the subject line noting that The Whaley Law Firm had requested his signature and to follow the prompts to execute the attached. In the body, he wrote: “SARE a Tuttle,” and asked for an update on the case. He recalled that, the last time he spoke to someone at the office, they expected the case would be in deliberations in January, but it was February and he had heard nothing since the end of January. He closed by saying he looked forward to hearing back soon and signed, “Sincerely, Michael Crader.” The message was sent from his iPad.\n\nEarlier correspondence in this chain began on December 23, 2024. In that message, Sarena Tuttle replied to Michael, explaining that while the items he listed were “Special Damages,” they do not necessarily fall under the “Lost Wage” category. She clarified that the issue at hand was directly related to his lost income, not incidental expenses. She noted that taxes are directly related to income and, as a self-employed individual and farm owner, tax information serves as a statement of income to the government and is used to determine and verify claims of “Lost Wages,” any diminished capacity to earn, and any lost revenue from his farm. She concluded by saying she would forward his questions to Aaron and Bryce for further explanation if needed, and she included her contact information and noted his new email address.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Michael Crader sent another message (the time listed as 4:33 PM, with a “Sent from my iPad” closing). In this note, he addressed “Interrogatory number five” and described work-related losses tied to the accident: a part-time worker had to be called in on the day of the accident, with $300 paid by KFB; wages lost due to having to hire someone to install a waterline amounted to $10,800 and were not reimbursed. He also explained that his wife could not go out to work because she had to perform much of the farm work he would have done, thereby constituting additional lost wages. He questioned why the taxes for the last five years were needed, expressing concern about sharing tax information and a reluctance to reveal financial details due to fear of consequences. The message ended with “Sent from my iPad.”\n\nOn December 19, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent Michael a DocuSign notification. The body, as relayed by Sarena, asked Michael to review the attached Responses to the Defendant Comb’s Discovery Request and, if satisfied, to execute the attached verification page. It instructed him to click “Finish” so the document would re-route back automatically. It provided contact options for questions: (502) 583-4022, Ext 104, or Bryce, Ext 114, and signed by Sarena, The Whaley Law Firm. The accompanying DocuSign notice emphasized that the email contained a secure link and should not be shared, and included a note that the signing could be done via an alternate method at Docusign.com using the security code 568DE87F97444B5481CFA7117A3D32E67, along with standard information about DocuSign’s services, and the usual instructions to reach out to the sender with any questions.\n\nThe December 20, 2024 DocuSign-related message also included boilerplate notices. It stated that the message was sent by Aaron Whaley using the DocuSign Electronic Signature Service and included typical disclosures such as “Do Not Share This Email,” as well as sections detailing alternate signing methods and the security code referenced above. The content also reiterated the option to download the DocuSign app and directed the recipient to DocuSign’s support resources for signing assistance.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the working contact details for Sarena M. Tuttle are listed as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line is (502) 357-9971, and her office line is (502) 583-4022, Ext 104. Her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating it is her new email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Michael Crader with the subject line: “Re: The Whaley Law Firm has requested your signature. Follow the prompts to execute the attached.” The message was from Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines were D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104. Her email address listed was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as a new email address. The email was sent to Michael Crader at michaelcrader67@gmail.com, with Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) and Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) copied, and the date/time shown was Thursday, February 6, 2025, at 11:13:26 AM Eastern Time.\n\nGood morning Michael, the email began. It stated that the written discovery phase (the packets of questions) has been answered and returned on both sides just before the New Year. In their last case review with Bryce, the firm discussed attempting to settle your claim before proceeding with oral discovery, also known as depositions. A deposition is described as a session where you, Bryce, and the Defense sit down with a court reporter to verbally review the facts of the case. If the Defense is willing to discuss settlement, they will begin the negotiations process; if they are not willing, they will move forward with scheduling the depositions. Bryce will follow up with the Defense Counsel, and you will be updated as soon as there is additional information.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle signed off as the sender, reiterating her role and providing contact details, including the firm’s new email address.\n\nEarlier correspondence is part of the same thread. On February 6, 2025, at around 10:54 AM, Michael Crader replied to Sarena, writing: “SARE a Tuttle, Just touching base and seeing where we are at on the case. Last I spoke to someone at the office they expected we would be in deliberations in January but it’s February and haven’t heard anything since end of January. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.” The message was sent from his iPad.\n\nTurning back to December 2024, on December 23, 2024, Sarena wrote to Michael: “Good morning Michael, While yes the things you listed are ‘Special Damages’, they do not necessarily fall under the ‘Lost Wage’ category.

He stated: “Aaron Interrogatory number five We had a guy working for us part-time and I had to call him in and to work the day of the accident. $300 was paid by kfb We lost wages by having to hire out to have waterline put in $10,800.

The email stated: “Aaron Whaley sent you a document to review and sign.

Michael was instructed to click “Finish” so the document would re-route back automatically, and to contact The Whaley Law Firm directly at (502) 583-4022 Ext 104 or Bryce at Ext 114 if he had any questions. The signature line read: “-Sarena, The Whaley Law Firm.” The email included a header indicating it was powered by DocuSign, with the standard security notices, including: “Do Not Share This Email,” a secure signing link, and an alternate signing method with a security code (568DE87F97444B5481CFA7117A3D32E67). It also shared the typical DocuSign boilerplate, explaining electronic signature speed and safety, and reminded Michael that this email contained a secure link to DocuSign and should not be shared. The message concluded with the line: “This message was sent to you by Aaron Whaley who is using the DocuSign Electronic Signature Service.

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader. The Whaley Law Firm, with Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, has been handling communications for Michael Crader regarding his motor vehicle accident case and related settlement and discovery matters.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm sent Michael Crader a DocuSign notification requesting that he review and sign the document titled “Responses to the Defendant Comb’s Discovery Request.” The email advised Michael to review the document and sign if he was satisfied with the responses, and provided a secure signing link and alternate signing method, including a security code. The message identified Aaron Whaley as the sender and stated that the signer should not share the email, link, or access code, and it described DocuSign as the platform used for electronic signing. The contact details included in the message were Aaron Whaley’s and Sarena Tuttle’s, with a note that the new email address is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nShortly thereafter, on December 20, 2024, Michael Crader wrote back to Sarena Tuttle, addressing Interrogatory Number Five. He explained that a part-time worker had been called in to work on the day of the accident, resulting in a payment of $300 by KFB. He stated that they lost wages due to having to hire out for a water line installation, amounting to $10,800, which had not been reimbursed. He added that his wife has not been able to go out to work because she had to take on much of the farm work he could no longer perform, thus constituting more lost wages. He also asked why the defense needed their taxes and expressed a desire not to reveal their financial information.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied to Michael, clarifying the distinctions between “Special Damages” and “Lost Wages.” She explained that the question pertained to lost income and possibly diminished earning capacity, as taxes are tied to income and are used to verify a claimant’s lost wages and lost revenue from the farm for a self-employed business. She noted that she would relay Michael’s questions to Aaron and Bryce for further explanation if needed and provided her contact details again, including the new email address.\n\nEarlier, on December 20, 2024, Michael had also sent messages through DocuSign and email regarding the discovery process. The exchanges included discussion of the responses to discovery and the status of the case as it related to the ongoing discovery phases.\n\nMoving forward to February 6, 2025, the status of discovery and settlement discussions was discussed. At 10:54 AM, Michael Crader wrote to Sarena Tuttle, seeking an update on the case. He noted that he had been told they would be in deliberations in January, but it was now February, and he had not heard anything since the end of January; he asked to be updated. At 11:13 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied that the written discovery phase had been answered and returned on both sides just before the New Year. She explained that, in a case review with Bryce, they discussed attempting to settle the claim before proceeding with oral discovery (depositions). She described a deposition as an in-person session with a court reporter where the facts of the case are discussed, and said that if the defense was willing to discuss settlement, negotiations would begin; if not, the depositions would be scheduled. Bryce would follow up with Defense Counsel, and Michael would be updated as additional information became available. At 12:15 PM, Michael responded, “Ok sounds great! Thank you.” Later, at 1:47 PM, Michael sent another message: “Just touching base on my case from our last correspondents on 2/6/25. Can you please let me know what progress you all have made, whether settlement discussions have been ongoing, or if we are proceeding forward with depositions.” This message was sent from his iPad.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, the thread includes a direct outreach from Sarena Tuttle with the subject: “Re: The Whaley Law Firm has requested your signature. Follow the prompts to execute the attached.” In that message, Sarena informed Michael that Bryce and the Defense had been conversing about his claim and that Bryce had resubmitted their demand for policy limits roughly the previous week. She stated that once a response is received, they would reach out with an update, and she invited Michael to contact them with any further questions. The signature block for Sarena included her title as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), main office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and email (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), noting that this is a new email address. The message was sent from Sarena, and it included the firm’s standard Docusign-related disclosures about signing documents electronically.\n\nThat same day, March 17, 2025, at about 1:47 PM, Michael Crader replied to Sarena, saying he was “Just touching base on my case from our last correspondents on 2/6/25” and asking for an update on whether settlement discussions had been ongoing or if depositions were to proceed. The exchange indicates ongoing activity around settlement negotiations, potential depositions, and the need to sign the attached document referenced in the March 17 email.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023\nClient: Michael Crader\n\nIn this case, the most recent message is from Michael Crader to Sarena Tuttle dated March 17, 2025. The subject line indicates that The Whaley Law Firm has requested Michael’s signature and that he should follow the prompts to execute the attached document. In that email, Michael touches base on his case and references their last correspondence on February 6, 2025. He asks Sarena to update him on any progress, specifically whether settlement discussions have been ongoing or if the team plans to proceed with depositions. He thanks her for her time and says he looks forward to hearing from her soon. The message was sent from Michael Crader’s iPad.\n\nEarlier, on February 6, 2025, there are two distinct exchanges. The first is a brief reply from Michael Crader at approximately 12:15 PM that reads, “OK sounds great! Thank you,” and is also sent from his iPad. Earlier that same day, at about 11:13 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle replied to Michael. In her message, Sarena explains that the written discovery phase—those packets of questions—has been answered and returned on both sides just before the New Year. She notes that in a recent case review with Bryce, they discussed attempting to settle Michael’s claim before proceeding with oral discovery, also known as depositions. She describes a deposition as a session where Michael, Bryce, and the defense sit with a court reporter to verbally go over the facts of the case. If the defense is willing to discuss settlement, negotiations will begin; if not, they will move forward with scheduling the depositions. Bryce will follow up with the defense counsel, and they will update Michael as soon as additional information is available. Sarena’s signature identifies her as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address and contact numbers, and notes a new email address.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, at about 10:54 AM, Michael Crader had written to Sarena to touch base and inquire about the case’s current status. He recalls that someone at the office had indicated they would be in deliberations in January, but that it is now February and he has heard nothing since the end of January. He asks to hear back soon and signs the message, “Sincerely, Michael Crader.” This message was also sent from his iPad.\n\nThe chronology back before February includes communications in December 2024. On December 23, 2024, at approximately 10:36 AM, Sarena wrote to Michael regarding alleged damages. She explains that while the items Michael listed are “Special Damages,” they do not necessarily fall under the “Lost Wage” category. She clarifies that the question concerns his lost income, not additional incurred expenses. Regarding taxes, she explains that as a self-employed individual and business owner, taxes are essentially a statement of income to the government and are used to determine and verify the claim of Lost Wages, any diminished capacity to earn, and any lost revenue from his farm. She adds that she would note Michael’s questions to Aaron and Bryce for further explanation if needed. The message includes Sarena’s professional signature, reiterating her role and contact details, along with a note to be aware of her new email address.\n\nEarlier, on December 20, 2024, at 4:33 PM, Michael Crader sent a message to Aaron. In it, he discusses Interrogatory number five and provides concrete figures: a part-time worker hired to cover the day of the accident cost $300 paid by KFB; lost wages due to hiring someone to handle a waterline project totaling $10,800, which has not been reimbursed; his wife has been unable to work because she now must perform much of the farm work he was supposed to handle, resulting in further lost wages. He also questions why the defense needs their taxes, stating that it does not make sense and that he does not want them to know how much money they have, fearing potential risk if those amounts are disclosed. The message concludes with the standard “Sent from my iPad.”\n\nThe December 19, 2024 email thread shows that Aaron Whaley had sent Michael a document via Docusign for review and signature. The subject line indicates that Aaron provided the document for Michael to review and sign, and to execute the attached verification page. The email instructs Michael to click “Finish” so the document would re-route automatically back to the firm, and to contact the firm at (502) 583-4022 Ext 104 or Bryce at Ext 114 if any questions arise. The email is part of Docusign’s secure signing process, including a security code (568DE87F97444B5481CFA7117A3D32E67) and notes emphasizing that the signing process is secure and legally binding. The message also includes standard Docusign boilerplate and instructions about sharing and accessing documents, and it references the sender, Aaron Whaley, and the recipient’s address and contact details. The message closes with the usual administrative notes about Docusign support and access.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns Michael Crader’s motor vehicle accident matter against Megan Combs, filed in Morgan Circuit Court under case number 24-CI-00065. The client is Michael Crader, and the matter is referenced in the file as Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Communications referenced here occurred between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and counsel at Dehner & Ellis, PLLC, with the Whaley firm handling the Crader matter. The email chain includes W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (the sender in the exchanges) and John J. Ellis, Esq., of Dehner & Ellis, PLLC (the recipient), with the following recipients and copies: Sarena Tuttle was copied, and Michael Crader’s MVA filevine email address MichaelCraderMVAZ3893535@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com was included in the cc line. The notice on the emails states that the messages are intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged information, with instructions to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error and to refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, after written discovery appeared to be complete, Bryce Koon sent a settlement demand to John Ellis, stating that the demand was for the policy limits of $25,000. He noted that Crader’s medical expenses exceed $100,000 and that his client’s liability position remained confident. Koon asked whether the carrier would tender the policy limits so the parties could avoid the costs and delay of depositions. He included his standard contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207.\n\nIn response, on March 6, 2025 at 4:07 PM, John Ellis wrote to Bryce Koon to confirm that his settlement offer was, with the exception of any PIP lien, inclusive of all liens—including any medical liens or a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs lien—and that there would be entry of an Agreed Order of Dismissal with prejudice.\n\nShortly thereafter, on March 6, 2025 at 4:13 PM, Bryce Koon replied, “Yes, that is correct.” The message included the same privilege disclaimer as the prior correspondence.\n\nFinally, on March 18, 2025 at 11:01:59 AM (Eastern Time), Bryce Koon sent a follow-up email to counsel, saying, “Good afternoon counsel, just wanted to circle back on this one. Any update appreciated.” The email, like the others, included the standard privilege notices and the signature block for The Whaley Law Firm, with Koon’s contact details reiterated.\n\nThe note also includes the signature blocks for the other involved firm: Dehner & Ellis, PLLC, located at 206 East Main St., Morehead, KY 40351; phone 606-783-1504; fax 606-784-2744; email johnellis@dehnerandellis.com. The content reflects ongoing settlement discussions surrounding the Crader v. Combs matter, including the requested policy-limit tender, the handling of PIP and other liens, and the potential for an Agreed Order of Dismissal with prejudice, all within the context of the Morgan Circuit Court case 24-CI-00065.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader. The following is a narrative record of email exchanges and DocuSign activity involving Michael Crader and The Whaley Law Firm regarding his motor-vehicle-accident claim, spanning December 2024 through March 2025, and including settlement discussions, discovery responses, and requests for signature.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent Michael Crader a document to review and sign via DocuSign. The message instructed Michael to review the attached Responses to the Defendant’s Discovery Request and, if satisfied with the responses, to execute the attached verification page. Michael was told to click \"Finish\" so the document would re-route automatically back to The Whaley Law Firm, and he was provided contact options for questions: (502) 583-4022 Ext 104 or Bryce at Ext 114. The email was sent under Aaron Whaley’s name and referenced Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with the signature line indicating Sarena’s address and contact details, including the note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Michael replied with specifics about Interrogatory Number Five: he described having had a part-time worker who was called in to work the day of the accident, noting that $300 was paid by KFB. He also stated that they lost wages due to having to hire someone to install a waterline, totaling $10,800, which had not been reimbursed. He added that his wife has been unable to work because she must take on more farm tasks, contributing to additional lost wages. He questioned why the defense would need their taxes and expressed concern about sharing financial information, saying he did not want them to know how much money they have.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded by clarifying that the items listed by Michael as “Special Damages” do not necessarily fall under the “Lost Wage” category. She explained that the question related to lost income, not additional incurred expenses. She noted that taxes are related to income, and as a self-employed individual and farm business owner, taxes reflect income to the government and are used to determine and verify lost wages, diminished capacity to earn, and lost revenue from the farm. She offered to note Michael’s questions to Aaron and Bryce for further explanation if needed, and she closed with her standard contact details and the reminder of her new email address.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, Sarena’s message was followed by the earlier content from Sarena again, outlining her title and the firm’s contact information.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, at 10:54 AM, Michael Crader wrote to Sarena Tuttle: he was seeking an update and noting that, from what he had heard, the case was expected to go to deliberations in January, but it was now February and he had not heard anything since the end of January. He asked to hear back soon.\n\nAt 11:13 AM on February 6, 2025, Sarena replied: the written discovery phase (the packets of questions) had been answered and returned on both sides just before the New Year. In a case review with Bryce, they discussed attempting to settle the claim before proceeding with oral discovery, also known as depositions. She explained that a deposition would involve Michael, Bryce, and the Defense sitting with a court reporter to review the facts of the case. If the Defense was willing to discuss settlement, negotiations would begin; if not, they would move forward with scheduling the depositions. Bryce would follow up with Defense Counsel, and they would update Michael as soon as additional information was available. Her email signature included her title and The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information, along with the note to use the new email address.\n\nAlso on February 6, 2025, at 10:54 AM, Michael Crader had written again to Sarena starting with, “SARE a Tuttle,” and stating that he was checking in to see where the case stood. He mentioned that someone at the office had expected deliberations in January, but it was February and there had been no update since the end of January, and he asked to hear back soon.\n\nLater on February 6, 2025, at 12:15 PM, Michael replied: “Ok sounds great! Thank you Michael Crader,” signaling agreement or acknowledgment of the prior information.\n\nAlso on February 6, 2025, at approximately 1:47 PM, Michael Crader sent another message: “Just touching base on my case from our last corespondents on 2/6/25. Can you please let me know what progress you all have made if settlement discussions have been ongoing or if we are proceeding forward with depositions. Thank you again for your time and looking forward to hearing from you soon.” This message was sent from his iPad.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, at about 1:47 PM, Michael Crader again wrote: “Sarena, Just touching base on my case from our last corespondents on 2/6/25. Can you please let me know what progress you all have made if settlement discussions have been ongoing or if we are proceeding forward with depositions.” He thanked her and again requested an update, sending from his iPad.\n\nShortly after, on March 17, 2025 at approximately 2:10 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied: “Good afternoon Michael, Bryce & the Defense have been conversing about your claim & Bryce resubmitted our Demand for Policy Limits roughly last week. As soon as we receive a response, we will reach out with an update. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.” Her message was signed with her name and title and included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details and a note about the new email address.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 10:36 AM, Michael Crader responded: “Sarena, Wow, I would’ve thought they would’ve provided the policy limits as of now. Sounds good hope to hear from you soon.” He signed, “Sincerely, Michael Crader,” and the message was sent from his iPad.\n\nThis sequence reflects ongoing efforts to obtain policy-limit information, discuss settlement versus depositions, and obtain signed discovery-related documents, with the firm providing updates and clarifying the discovery and settlement process throughout the period.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023. Client: Michael Crader. This matter is Michael Crader v. Megan Combs in Morgan Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-00065. The file references and correspondence pertain to the Michael Crader motor-vehicle accident matter, with the project labeled “Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023.”\n\nIn a chain of emails between March 5 and March 18, 2025, counsel discussed settlement and discovery status. On March 5, 2025 at 10:55 a.m., W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to John J. Ellis, Esq., of Dehner & Ellis, PLLC, noting that written discovery appeared to be complete and that, before proceeding with depositions and incurring further time and expense, he was demanding the policy limits of $25,000. He emphasized that his client’s medical expenses exceed $100,000 and that they were confident in their liability position, and he asked to know whether the carrier would tender the policy limits to avoid unnecessary expense and delay. The email stated these positions and was accompanied by the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, at 4:07 p.m., John Ellis replied, confirming that Bryce’s settlement offer was, with the exception of any PIP lien, inclusive of all liens—whether medical liens or a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs lien—and that an Agreed Order of Dismissal with prejudice would accompany the settlement.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 4:13 p.m. on March 6, 2025, Bryce Koon replied, “Yes, that is correct,” indicating agreement with Ellis’s confirmation. That exchange also included the standard privilege and confidentiality disclaimer typically accompanying such emails.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 11:01:59 a.m., Bryce Koon sent another message to counsel, requesting an update on the matter. The email was sent from Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm to John Ellis at Dehner & Ellis, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d and including a Filevine project address for Michael Crader’s MVA file (MichaelCraderMVAZ3893535@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The message, like the prior communications, included the firm’s usual privilege disclaimer.\n\nThe March 18 email also carried the sender’s contact information: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone number (502) 365-5043; fax number (502) 237-3207. The prior messages featured the following contacts: John J. Ellis of Dehner & Ellis, PLLC, located at 206 East Main Street, Morehead, KY 40351; telephone 606-783-1504; fax 606-784-2744; email johnellis@dehnerandellis.com. The thread shows the ongoing settlement discussions, with the March 5 demand for the policy limits, the March 6 confirmation that liens would be treated as described, and the March 18 request for an update, all within the context of the Michael Crader v. Megan Combs case in Morgan Circuit Court.",

      "natural_language": "In the motor-vehicle accident matter Michael Crader v. Megan Combs, Morgan Circuit Court, the file is labeled Michael-Crader-MVA-5-19-2023, with Michael Crader identified as the client. The communication thread centers on counsel for Michael Crader and for Megan Combs: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, acting for Michael Crader (and Mary Crader), and John J. Ellis, Esq., of Dehner & Ellis, PLLC, representing Megan Combs. The July 11, 2025 email from Bryce Koon was addressed to John Ellis and copied to a Filevine Project email for Michael Crader; the message header lists The Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville, Kentucky contact information and the usual attorney-client confidentiality notices.\n\nThe substantive back-and-forth began with John Ellis’s March 26, 2025 reply. Ellis explained that there are five potential claims against his client, Megan Combs. He understood that Bryce Koon represents Mary Crader and Michael Crader, and he noted that there were three passengers in Ms. Combs’s car who also have possible claims. He stated that Megan Combs’s vehicle carries liability coverage of $25,000 per person/$50,000 per incident. Because of these multiple potential claimants, Ellis said he would need to obtain releases from all of them. He expressed hope that the matter could be worked out, but cautioned that it would take some time. He invited Bryce to call if he wanted to discuss further.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up by email with counsel, asking for any updates in this regard. He included his standard confidentiality notices and the Whaley Law Firm contact information in the signature.\n\nThen, on July 11, 2025, Bryce sent another brief inquiry: “Counsel, Any update for me on this one?” The email again carried the Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville contact details and the same confidentiality disclaimer. The CC line for this message indicates it was sent to Michael Crader MVA 5/19/2023’s Filevine project email address, alongside the John Ellis correspondence.\n\nIn summary, the case involves five potential claims arising from Megan Combs’s motor-vehicle collision—two from Michael Crader and Mary Crader and three from the other occupants in Ms. Combs’s car. The only stated liability coverage for the Combs vehicle is $25,000 per person/$50,000 per incident, and Ellis indicated that releases from all potential claimants would be needed. The parties have engaged in a multi-step settlement discussion, acknowledging it may require time, and the chronology includes repeated follow-ups in March, May, and July of 2025.",

Phase 1 generated an inventory of 94 files, including 53 scrambled .md files used for content-only analysis with filenames randomized to eliminate bias. Phase 2 employed parallel processing with three sub-agents analyzing 40-file chunks to prevent context exhaustion. Phase 3 issued a quality review with 98.44% accuracy (a 1.56% error rate); the sole error involved a VitalChart invoice that had been miscategorized as Medical Records instead of Expenses, which was corrected before execution. Phase 4 executed 68 operations—67 moves/renames and 1 deletion—with zero execution errors. Phase 5 verified 100% naming convention compliance, ensured all PDF and MD companions were reunited, and cleaned the root directory.\n\nResults: A total of 150 files were organized across eight buckets.

Litigation included 28 files, encompassing the complaint, answer, discovery requests/responses, with two files flagged NEEDS REVIEW due to illegible Certificate of Service dates. Client contained 7 files including voicemails and communications. Investigation contained 9 files, consisting of scene photos.
