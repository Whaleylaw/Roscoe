The chain begins with an earlier message from Aaron Whaley dated January 18, 2023 at 3:27 p.m., addressed to Bethany Willcutt, in which Aaron notes that he attached a recent case, Mason v. Stikes. He states that the case discusses the law on all the issues they have, including that a wrongful death claim is sufficient to grant jurisdiction for an ancillary estate in Kentucky; that an ancillary estate may be opened before the primary estate and that he will open a Texas Estate; and that out-of-state residents may be the administrators of said estate. The message includes Whaley\u2019s signature block with his firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and his phone number (502-583-4022), followed by Bethany Willcutt\u2019s contact details for Prince & Willcutt, PSC (1005 Main St, Benton, KY 42025; bethany@princewillcutt.com; phone 270-527-8612; fax 270-527-0916). The chain also contains a confidentiality statement noting the information is confidential and for the intended recipient only, with instructions to return and delete if received in error. The forwarded message appears to have been sent to the Robyn Hester WD file from Aaron and is part of the correspondence between the two law firms regarding the estate matter.\n\nIn the body of the chain, on January 18, 2023, Aaron Whaley wrote to Bethany Willcutt, attaching Mason v. Stikes and explaining the legal issues at play: that a wrongful death claim is sufficient to grant jurisdiction for an ancillary estate in Kentucky; that an ancillary estate may be opened before the primary estate, and that Aaron would open a Texas Estate; and that out-of-state residents may be the administrators of said estate.\n\nOn January 19, 2023, at 10:03 a.m., Bethany responded to Aaron, indicating that the arrangement \u201cwill work,\u201d though she expressed concern that it may be more time-consuming than anticipated. She proposed the fee arrangement: a $2,000 nonrefundable retainer, billed against at $250 per hour, with overage billed if the retainer is exceeded. She asked if Aaron could sign the fee agreement and noted that she can send it over shortly, adding that probate court is typically Thursday afternoons.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:12 a.m., Aaron replied: \u201cYes, I can sign the fee agreement. I should have the AOC form signed by Mr. Sneed later today or tomorrow.\u201d\n\nThis correspondence, including the chain\u2019s subject and the involved parties, was then forwarded to the Robyn Hester WD/MVA file, with the participating counsel\u2019s signatures and contact details included in the exchange. The note preserves all stated details from the emails, including the proposed fee terms, the anticipated completion of the AOC form by Mr. Sneed, the legal points drawn from Mason v. Stikes, and the plan to open ancillary and Texas estates, as well as the confidentiality provisions present in the exchange.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. The client listed for this matter is Robyn Hester WD, in the Estate of Robyn Hester.\n\nThe email thread originates from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and was sent to Bethany Willcutt and to Robyn Hester WD/MVA 02/23/2022. The date on the header is January 24, 2023, at 5:33 PM Eastern Time, and the thread begins with a note that reads, \u201cSorry. Robert Lee Sneed III.\u201d\n\nIn the subsequent exchange, on January 24, 2023 at 5:29 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Bethany: \u201cMr. Sneed has informed me that his name is actually Roert Sneed III. He hasn't signed the Oath yet or the bond. I went ahead and changed his name on those.\u201d This followed an earlier message in the same thread, sent on January 20, 2023 at 12:17 PM, in which Whaley stated: \u201cHere is the signed AOC. What else do you need? I am sending you a check for the retainer.\u201d The message also included the sender\u2019s standard closing with contact information for Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications consistently identify Aaron Whaley as the sender, with the firm\u2019s address listed as 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and the phone number 502-583-4022. There are multiple copies of Whaley\u2019s signature and contact details included at the end of the correspondence.\n\nIn summary, the notes document a January 2023 exchange regarding the Estate of Robyn Hester, including: an early acknowledgment that the AOC had been signed and a retainer check would be sent; a correction of the client\u2019s name from Roert Sneed III to Robert Lee Sneed III; and the observation that the client had not yet signed the Oath or the bond, with the name updated on those documents accordingly. The communications are from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Bethany Willcutt (and to Robyn Hester WD/MVA 02/23/2022), with the firm\u2019s Louisville office contact details included.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022 concerns client Robyn Hester WD.\n\nOn February 8, 2023, at 2:12 PM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed Chauncey R. Hiestand, Esq., and several others with the subject FW: Hester HEADS UP. In that message, Aaron provided the AOC 805 forms, including the fiduciary bond and an affidavit for the oath of executor. He noted that the waiver for Chabrielle is on page 4 and stated that he would reach out to the probate attorney in Marshall County to get these items filed. He added that if the waiver is signed, he would include it as an addendum.\n\nThe email thread includes subsequent replies from Chauncey Hiestand, detailing the plan and timeline. In Chauncey\u2019s messages, he indicated that the consortium of parents\u2019 SOL runs on February 22. He noted that Marshall County probate has court every Thursday, which means the motion needed to be on for the next Thursday in order to file within the following week (by February 22). Chauncey\u2019s messages include the plan that Jason Ellis would work on the complaint; because of the time crunch, Aaron Whaley had the paperwork and forms to establish an ancillary estate in Marshall County with the father as administrator; Vince Johnson would work on obtaining a waiver from the mother to permit this. The plan was for a complaint to be filed and the others to intervene; he acknowledged there may already be a case filed on the wreck and asked whether they should file their own and worry about consolidation later. He also affirmed that given the SOL, they would file their own lawsuits with no motion-hour issues.\n\nChauncey\u2019s earlier note, dated February 8, 2023 at 11:22 AM, outlined the same plan: Jason would draft the complaint; due to time constraints, Aaron had the paperwork and forms to establish an ancillary estate in Marshall County with the father as administrator; Vince would secure the waiver from mom; a complaint would be filed and the rest would intervene; and there was consideration of whether a separate case had already been filed on this wreck and whether consolidation would follow.\n\nAdditional context in the chain includes formal email signatures and standard notices. Chauncey, in his replies, provided his address for WINTON & HIESTAND LAW GROUP, PLLC at 905 Baxter Avenue, Louisville, KY 40204, with phone and fax numbers, and noted his updated email address crh@LouisvilleLawOffice.com. He apologized for any grammatical errors if the messages were drafted from his iPhone and included a standard confidentiality notice about the information being intended only for the recipient and the need to delete the material if received in error. The thread also contains a second version of the contact block, reiterating the same information and including the same disclaimer language.\n\nThe thread concludes with Aaron Whaley\u2019s signature line as follows: Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022. The message references the attachments and the plan to utilize the AOC 805 fiduciary bond and executor oath forms, with the Chabrielle waiver on page 4 and the intention to file in Marshall County with the father as administrator, contingent on obtaining the waiver, and to add it as an addendum if signed.",

She said she hoped to file the matter the following morning after obtaining Bethany\u2019s signature and asked whether the retainer had been paid.\n\nAt 11:40 AM on January 26, 2023, Aaron Whaley wrote that the signed Affidavit and Fiduciary Bond were provided and asked if anything else was needed to get the matter filed, thanking the recipients.\n\nThe email thread includes the sign-off blocks from Aaron Whaley and the Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-583-4022, repeated in the communications.\n\nIn summary, the notes reflect ongoing efforts between late January and early February 2023 to prepare and file the Sneed-related documents for the Robyn Hester WD case, including securing an administrator for the Texas estate (and pursuing appointment in Kentucky by the February 23 deadline), arranging the retainer, addressing filing fees of $132.35, determining payment methods (check to Prince & Willcutt, PSC or credit card), and ensuring the signed Affidavit and Fiduciary Bond were in place, with Chabrielle (the mother) being pursued for a waiver of appointment. By February 9, 2023, there was a push to file by the February 22 deadline, with ongoing discussions about finalizing the necessary clearances and waivers.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD. This note contains an email thread about the subject \u201cRe: Sneed signed docs,\u201d related to the Robyn Hester WD/MVA case (wrongful death/motor vehicle accident) filed on 02/23/2022.\n\nOn Friday, February 10, 2023, at 11:08:17 a.m. -0500, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Bethany Willcutt of Prince & Willcutt, PSC, with the message: \u201cShould have it by Monday.\u201d In a prior exchange on the same day at 10:42 a.m., Bethany outlined the situation. She stated that she would need Aaron to provide an affidavit showing that notice of the hearing was sent to the mother via certified mail and that the mother must have at least one week\u2019s notice of the hearing. She explained that she could place the case on Thursday\u2019s docket, but without the mother\u2019s signature, the court would not sign off on it. This would push the matter to the following Thursday, which would be after the filing cutoff date for Aaron\u2019s action. She emphasized the need for the mother\u2019s signature and asked whether Aaron was confident he could obtain it. Bethany added that if the mother\u2019s signature were obtained to allow Aaron\u2019s client to be the administrator, the client\u2019s written oath would be sufficient without the administrator attending in person, and that they could get everything done next Thursday.\n\nEarlier, on February 9, 2023, at 9:01 p.m., Aaron wrote: \u201cShould have the waiver soon.\u201d Earlier still, at 7:27 p.m. on February 9, Bethany had written to Aaron: \u201cHi, Aaron, I\u2019m going to try to get that case filed and on the docket next Thursday. If you can get me the waiver from the mother, that will make everything go much quicker/smoother. Otherwise, will father be able to come to court? If not, we can work on a Zoom link. Judge Telle is just a little particular about how he likes to do probate cases.\u201d The thread includes confidentiality notices typical of the parties\u2019 communications.\n\nFrom the communications, Bethany\u2019s proposed approach relied on obtaining the mother\u2019s signature and a waiver, along with notice by certified mail, to enable the case to be filed and placed on the docket next Thursday. If the mother signed to authorize the client as administrator, the client\u2019s written oath would suffice without attendance. The plan was to proceed with the hearing and related probate steps the following Thursday, subject to the mother\u2019s signature, the waiver, and the judge\u2019s preferences (Judge Telle\u2019s particularities regarding probate proceedings). The emails also show the parties\u2019 ongoing coordination, with contact details for the attorneys: Bethany Willcutt of Prince & Willcutt, PSC, located at 1005 Main St, Benton, KY 42025; email bethany@princewillcutt.com; phone 270-527-8612; fax 270-527-0916.

The body of the message stated, \u201cAaron, Please find attached the executed wavier from Ms. Hester.\u201d Chauncey\u2019s signature identified his firm\u2019s address as 905 Baxter Avenue, Louisville, KY 40204, and provided his phone numbers (502) 882-3133 and fax (502) 882-3134, along with a note that his new email address is crh@LouisvilleLawOffice.com.

The message did not include the executed waiver in the forwarded excerpt, but indicated that a waiver was attached.\n\nSubsequently, at 11:53 AM, Vince Johnson forwarded to Jason Ellis a message titled \u201cFW: Waiver.\u201d Jason Ellis, an attorney with Siebert & Johnson, PLLC at 2741 Brownsboro Rd, Louisville, KY 40206, phone (502) 589-2246 and fax (502) 589-4488, responded with a confidentiality notice stating that the communication and any attachments are intended only for the addressee and may contain legally privileged information; if the recipient is not the intended recipient, dissemination or copying is prohibited and the recipient should notify the sender and destroy the original.\n\nFollowing that, at 11:55 AM, Jason Ellis forwarded the chain to Chauncey Hiestand with the subject \u201cFW: Waiver.\u201d Ellis\u2019s contact information appeared in the forwarded message, confirming his role as attorney for Siebert & Johnson, PLLC.\n\nIn sum, the chain shows an evolving correspondence beginning with Chabrielle Hester\u2019s initial Waiver message at 11:52 AM, followed by a series of forwards between Vince Johnson and Jason Ellis, then to Chauncey Hiestand, and finally a separate forwarding by Aaron Whaley later that day. The culminating notice from Aaron Whaley to Bethany Willcutt, Kimberley Sharp, and Robyn Hester WD/MVA 02/23/2022 on February 10, 2023 at 13:28:55 -0500 indicated that the executed waiver was attached.

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD.\n\nThe note centers on the Hester Release in the Robyn Hester WD motor vehicle accident matter, and it includes a forwarded email from Aaron Whaley to Robyn Hester WD\u2019s Filevine project inbox dated December 2, 2024. The forwarded message carries a thread that originated with Sheriff Matt Hilbrecht of the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Office in late November 2024 and concerns obtaining a release and securing counsel for the matter.\n\nIn the thread, dated November 27, 2024 at 12:43 PM, Sheriff Matt Hilbrecht replied to Aaron Whaley with the short line: \u201cYes, for his office.\u201d He included his official contact information: Sheriff Matt Hilbrecht, Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Office, 52 Judicial Drive, Benton, KY 42025; phone 270-527-3112; fax 270-527-4759. He also attached the standard electronic confidentiality notice common to messages from the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Office, which states the transmission is intended solely for the named recipient and may contain confidential, proprietary, and/or legally privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should notify the office and delete the message and any attachments.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, at 10:58 AM on November 27, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022) had asked, \u201cOk that number is for Tom Blankenship?\u201d In his response, he indicated that the message was being discussed with Tom Blankenship and sought confirmation about the contact as part of coordinating representation.\n\nA follow-up from Sheriff Hilbrecht, dated November 27, 2024 at 11:34 AM, explained that he had reached out to Tom Blankenship. Blankenship had said he would contact Marshall County\u2019s County Attorney Jason Darnall and get back, but he seemed willing to fill the attorney role. Hilbrecht provided Blankenship\u2019s status and noted that if Whaley needed to contact Blankenship\u2019s office, the number was 270-527-1444. The message again carried the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Office confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier that day, at 4:01 PM on November 26, 2024, Aaron Whaley had written: \u201cHi Matt, Yes, we\u2019re good with covering the cost of your attorney. Let me know when you have someone lined up or if there are any questions I can answer for you.\u201d His signature block followed, listing Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022, and the same disclaimer about confidentiality.\n\nBefore that, at 4:23 PM on November 26, 2024, Matt Hilbrecht replied that after speaking with the County Attorney, he had been advised to obtain his own counsel before moving forward. He recalled Bethany Wilcutt having spoken to Aaron about concerns, and he stated his understanding (from Bethany) that Whaley would pay for him to hire his own attorney out of the proceeds, and he asked for confirmation that this arrangement was correct. His message again included his official Sheriff\u2019s Office contact details and the confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier still, at 2:31 PM on November 26, 2024, Aaron Whaley wrote: \u201cMatt just circling back on this release. Need to get it in.\u201d He again provided his firm\u2019s contact information and signature.\n\nThe thread ends with the continued exchange of the parties\u2019 contact details and standard confidentiality notices, reflecting ongoing negotiations about the release (the Hester Release) and the arrangement for funding and counsel in the Robyn Hester WD MVA case. The December 2, 2024 note shows that this entire chain was forwarded to Robyn Hester WD\u2019s project inbox as part of the case file.",

Thank you for returning my call\nyesterday. I am going to give you the Cliff Notes version of where we are\non this case and what we are doing. This case stems from a very bad\naccident that happened on February 23, 2022. In that accident, Robyn Hester\nwas killed. Robyn was approximately 18 months old at the time. The accident\nitself involved many tractor trailers and cars. I have attached the\ncomplaint. We set up an Estate for Robyn in Marshall County with Robyn's\nbiological father, Robert Sneed, as the administrator. Later on, we\nsubstituted Matt Hilbrecht as a public administrator. We have reached a\nsettlement against one of the tractor trailers involved. This was the\nvehicle that Robyn was occupying and driven by Robyn's biological mother,\nChabrielle Hester. The only thing that we need to finalize the settlement\nis the release to be signed by Matt Hilbrecht as Public Administrator. We\nare still litigating against the other parties. I have attached the\ncomplaint and the release that we need to be signed.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or need anything else.\n\n-- \nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022",

She stated that all pleadings are up to date and referenced a filevine link. She attached a quick glance based on the pleadings in the file.

Client: Robyn Hester WD.\n\nIn the Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022 matter, dated February 19, 2025 at 12:40:11 PM (GMT-05:00), Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Sarena Tuttle with RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com CC\u2019d, stating that they needed to obtain depositions of the driver of the All in Trucking semi and to secure a 30(b)(6) deposition of All in Trucking. He specifically noted Sean Wilkes as the driver to be deposed and indicated the need for a 30(b)(6) deposition of All in Trucking.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 12:11 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied with the message \u201cHere are the obvious items.\u201d She explained that there were several Zip Files that she needed to double-check tomorrow from a computer, and she expressed concern that her laptop might not be able to hold all the downloads or reveal their contents. Her signature block identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with contact details including the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe prior work referenced in this thread includes a communication from February 18, 2025 at 4:22 PM, in which Aaron Whaley stated that he had added a folder to Dropbox containing the entire file from Winton and Heistand and asked Sarena to go through it to look for any depositions and expert reports.\n\nEarlier communications from February 3, 2025 show ongoing case management. At 10:51 AM, Aaron Whaley wrote that he had become sole counsel for the Estate and needed to determine the status, including the trial date with deadlines, who has been deposed, and what expert reports had been obtained from Chauncey Heistand, along with identifying which parties are out and which remain.\n\nSubsequently, at 12:51 PM on February 3, 2025, Sarena responded, saying she would get a summary prepared as soon as possible.\n\nAt 3:40 PM on February 3, 2025, Sarena posted that all pleadings were up to date and provided a filevine link. She attached a quick glance based on the pleadings in the file and noted that she had never been cc\u2019d on any correspondence related to this claim, suggesting that there might be additional discovery and/or NTTD not filed via CourtNet. She also stated that she had not received anything from Chauncey\u2019s office directly, including expert reports, nor did it appear that they had been filed.\n\nEarlier that day, at 12:51 PM, Sarena indicated she would summarize the matter as soon as possible (as noted above).\n\nFinally, at 10:51 AM on February 3, 2025, Aaron Whaley wrote that he was sole counsel for the Estate and needed to determine status, including the trial date with deadlines, who had been deposed in the case, what expert reports had been obtained from Chauncey Heistand, and which parties were out and which remained.\n\nContact details on the message chain reflect the Whaley Law Firm: Aaron Whaley, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone numbers 502-583-4022 and 502-357-9971, and the firm\u2019s address.

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD. The following narrative summarizes the email exchanges about the hearing and the Zoom link for hester/Bynum et al, labeled with the subject \u201chester/Bynum et al zoom link for hearing today.\u201d\n\nOn February 21, 2025, at 01:04:37 GMT-05:00, Aaron G. Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed Eddie A. Jones and RobynHesterZ3101900, writing, \u201cEddie, I hope this email finds you well. I saw that you renewed your MSJ in this case. I am a little confused. I thought we had this settled for your $30,000 limits? Let me know. Thanks.\u201d This indicates a renewal of the motion for summary judgment (MSJ) and raises a question about whether a settlement at the policy limits of $30,000 had been reached.\n\nEarlier correspondence from January 28, 2025 provides context for who would be involved in the hearing. At 3:35 PM, Eddie A. Jones replied with a brief \u201cThank you,\u201d followed by his professional signature, which identifies him as a Partner at BSG Paducah and provides his office address, telephone and fax numbers, email, and LinkedIn profile. The message also contained the confidentiality notice typical of attorney communications.\n\nChauncey R. Hiestand, Esq., then sent a pivotal message at 2:35 PM on January 28, 2025 to a long distribution list, including Eddie Jones, Blake Edwards, Sara Waddell, Jeri Poppe, Bobbie Harbeson, Jason Coltharp, Jake Bliss, and many others, with the subject \u201cRE: hester/Bynum et al zoom link for hearing today.\u201d In that message, he stated, \u201cAaron Whaley will proceed as counsel for the Estate. Jon Hollan obviously will continue to rep his client. Ms. Hester continues to be pro se as far as I know.\u201d He appended his contact information and included standard attorney notices and a caution that the email originated outside the organization.\n\nThat same day, January 28, 2025, at 3:33 PM, Eddie Jones sent another message to Chauncey Hiestand and the same extended distribution list, with the subject line \u201cRE: hester/Bynum et al zoom link for hearing today.\u201d He wrote, \u201cSo . . . If the judge grants this pending motion, who will represent which plaintiffs?\u201d This question concerns which counsel would represent which plaintiffs if the pending motion is granted, indicating ongoing coordination about representation in the possible post-motion landscape.\n\nEarlier still, Chauncey Hiestand had sent a 2:09 PM message on January 28, 2025, to Blake Edwards, Sara Waddell, Jeri Poppe, Bobbie Harbeson, Jason Coltharp, Jake Bliss, Christopher Brann, Annie Brown, Charles Cassis, Justin Duncan, Jason Ellis, Anthony Finaldi, Ryan Glass, S. Madison Gray, Jenny Hines, Jonathan Hollan, Jillian House, Davis Hunter, Chad Jackson, Vincent Johnson, N. Austin Kennady, Alexander Kuebbing, Marc Lovell, Jennifer Nordstrom, Tad Pardue, Melissa Richardson, Aris Rogers, Tyler Rucker, Gregg Thornton, Daniel Wenig, and Aaron Whaley; with copies to Douglas C. Ballantine, Daniel Wenig, Christopher Schaefer, Komal Tailor, and Amelia Reesor. The subject remained the same, and he cautioned that the email originated outside the organization. In that note, he reported, \u201cCalled clerk and courts office. Stay on the line. They are running behind. No need to panic.\u201d This reflects a real-time update about court scheduling and potential delays, advising calm while awaiting access to the hearing.\n\nIn addition to the substantive exchanges, the communications include standard attorney notices, confidentiality language, and the relevant email signatures and professional affiliations for the participants. The thread lists a broad group of recipients, reflecting extensive coordination among counsel for multiple parties in the matter, and it repeatedly references the Zoom link for the hearing today as the focal topic.\n\nIn sum, the record shows ongoing discussion about the MSJ renewal and the status of a possible settlement at the policy limits, clarifications on who will represent which plaintiffs if the pending motion is granted, and operational notes about court scheduling and delays as the hearing approached. The participants include Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), Eddie A. Jones (BSG Paducah), Chauncey Hiestand (Winton & Hiestand Law Group), and a wide distribution list of associated counsel, with Chauncey indicating that Aaron would represent the Estate, Jon Hollan would continue to represent his client, and Robyn Hester would appear pro se to the extent known. The exchange also notes that the clerk\u2019s office was behind schedule at one point, with guidance to stay on the line and not panic.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD.\n\nIn a matter titled \u201chester/Bynum et al zoom link for hearing today,\u201d dated February 21, 2025, an email thread circulated among counsel and Robyn Hester. The discussion centers on whether the decedent\u2019s mother (referred to as \u201cmom\u201d) will sign a release, and what claims would remain if the Estate signs a release. The first exchange in the thread shows Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm writing to Eddie A. Jones of BSG Paducah, with Robyn Hester copied. Aaron states: \u201cI don\u2019t think mom will sign anything. However, what claim does she have against your client? If the Estate signs a release what claim is left that mom has? Your client didn't hit moms truck or mom.\u201d The subject line reiterates the hearing context.\n\nEddie Jones replies later that same day, indicating a difficult path to settlement if the Mother will not sign a release. He writes: \u201cThere does not seem to be any path that gets this case settled if the Mother won\u2019t sign a release. I need a settlement that releases my client from all claims related to this accident. If you think you can get Mother to sign a release I\u2019m willing to talk.\u201d The thread includes a standard external-email caution note and the message continues with a separate exchange that references a renewed MSJ (motion for summary judgment).\n\nEarlier in the day, at 12:04:37 PM, Aaron Whaley sends a message to Eddie Jones and the Robyn Hester Filevine address, with the subject \u201cRe: hester/Bynum et al zoom link for hearing today.\u201d In this note, Aaron writes: \u201cEddie, I hope this email finds you well. I saw that you renewed you MSJ in this case. I am a little confused. I thought we had this settled for your $30,000 limits? Let me know. Thanks.\u201d The email is signed \u201cAaron G. Whaley.\u201d The thread includes the standard caution that the email originated outside the organization and to be wary of links or attachments.\n\nThe chain also shows earlier correspondence from January 28, 2025. In a message dated 3:35 PM, Eddie Jones wrote a brief \u201cThank you.\u201d followed by his full professional signature, which lists him as a Partner at BSG Paducah, with a Paducah, KY address (410 Broadway, Paducah, KY 42001), phone number (270) 442-4369, fax (270) 442-4689, and email ejones@bsg-pad.com, along with a LinkedIn link (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddie-jones-21bbb16/), and a confidentiality notice about attorney-client privilege.\n\nEarlier still, Chauncey R. Hiestand, Esq., of Winton & Hiestand Law Group, PLC, sent a message on January 28, 2025, at 2:35 PM regarding who would represent which parties if the judge granted a pending motion. The message states: \u201cAaron Whaley will proceed as counsel for the Estate. Jon Hollan obviously will continue to rep his client. Ms. Hester continues to be pro se as far as I know.\u201d The email was addressed to multiple recipients including Eddie Jones, Blake Edwards, Sara Waddell, Jeri Poppe, Bobbie Harbeson, and many others, with a cautionary note about the email originating outside the organization.\n\nIn a contemporaneous exchange on January 28, 2025, at 2:09 PM, Chauncey Hiestand asked, in a separate message,: \u201cSo . . . If the judge grants this pending motion, who will represent which plaintiffs?\u201d This message was part of a broader thread involving numerous recipients, including Eddie Jones and Aaron Whaley, and it carried the same outside-origin caution about links or attachments.\n\nLater, at 3:33 PM on January 28, 2025, Eddie Jones replied to Chauncey Hiestand and the same group, followed by his own signature, asking for clarification about representation in the event of a pending motion\u2019s grant. The email chain around this date included extensive CC\u2019d parties such as Douglas C. Ballantine, Daniel I. Wenig, Christopher E. Schaefer, Komal Tailor, and Amelia Reesor, and continued the theme of how the litigation would proceed with respect to representation among the plaintiffs.\n\nIn sum, the February 21, 2025 thread centers on settlement dynamics tied to a release from the Mother/Estate, with Aaron Whaley challenging what claims would remain if the Estate signs and noting the apparent absence of liability from the plaintiff\u2019s side (the client did not collide with the mother or her vehicle). Eddie Jones asserts that a full release is necessary to settle, while acknowledging potential discussion if the Mother would sign. The earlier January exchanges establish who would represent which clients if a motion were granted, with Aaron Whaley representing the Estate, Jon Hollan to continue representing his client, and Robyn Hester noted as proceeding pro se. The communications include multiple cautions about external-origin emails, full professional signatures with contact details, and a repeated focus on the status of a pending motion and a $30,000 policy limit. The thread ends with the last substantive note being a February 21, 2025 exchange, following earlier January communications, and then a truncated caution-styled line indicating the external-origin disclaimer.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022\nClient: Robyn Hester WD\n\nIn the matter identified as Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022, concerning Robyn Hester WD, the team was seeking and confirming clarification of representation for the Hester ORDER. The exchange began with an email thread on March 6, 2025, involving Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm and Sarena M. Tuttle, the firm\u2019s Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, with Robyn Hester WD cc\u2019d on the communication.\n\nEarly in the day, around 1:03 PM, Sarena noted that something had been received via USPS, presumably related to the matter at hand. Later, at approximately 2:05 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Sarena outlining the content that should appear in the entry of appearance. He instructed that the filing should clarify that the firm contracted with Bethany Wilcutt to serve as local counsel for the estate and that Whaley Law Firm had been co-counsel with attorneys Winton and Heistand. He further stated that with Winton and Heistand withdrawing, Whaley Law Firm would be the sole counsel of the estate, with Bethany Wilcutt serving as local counsel.\n\nAt around 2:48 PM, Sarena prepared and sent an EOA (Entry of Appearance) with a Clarification of Representation for Aaron\u2019s review and approval prior to filing with the Marshall County Probate Court, including her standard signature block and contact information (noting the new email address). The email was addressed to Aaron and included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s details and the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky office information.\n\nApproximately an hour later, at 3:25:05 PM GMT-05:00 on the same day, Aaron responded, \u201cLooks good, thank you,\u201d indicating approval of the EOA with Clarification of Representation for filing.\n\nThe thread shows the chain of communications among the Whaley Law Firm team regarding the representation status for the estate in this case. The discussion confirms that the estate\u2019s counsel arrangement had shifted from a multi-counsel arrangement (with Winton and Heistand) to a configuration where The Whaley Law Firm is the sole counsel, with Bethany Wilcutt serving as local counsel, and that the EOA with Clarification of Representation was prepared for filing with Marshall County Probate Court. The cc line indicates Robyn Hester WD was included in the correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD.\n\nIn the Robyn Hester WD matter, the latest update came on March 11, 2025, from Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm. In her message to Aaron Whaley (with RobynHesterZ3101900@ louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com copied), she noted that she had sent out the initial request for deposition dates and had drafted a Scheduling Chart to keep track of responses. She planned to save the chart to a file and pin it to the top for easy reference and would update it as responses came in. Her signature also indicates her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with her contact information for the firm.\n\nEarlier correspondence establishes the ongoing status and planning. On February 3, 2025 at approximately 10:51 AM, Aaron Whaley stated that he was now sole counsel for the Estate and that they needed to determine the overall status: the trial date with deadlines, who had been deposed, what expert reports had been obtained from Chauncey Heistand, and which parties were out or remaining in the case. Later that same day, at about 12:51 PM, Sarena replied that she would get the status summarized as soon as possible. She added that all pleadings were up to date, providing a quick glance based on the pleadings in the file (with a FileVine link). She also noted that she had never been cc\u2019d on any correspondence related to this claim and suspected there was additional discovery and/or NTTD that had not been filed via CourtNet. She further stated she had not received anything directly from Chauncey\u2019s office, including expert reports, nor did it appear those reports had been filed. A follow-up message from Sarena later on February 3 reiterated that she would summarize the status, and she again confirmed the pleadings were up to date and referenced the FileVine link, while maintaining that she had not received materials from Chauncey Heistand.\n\nOn February 18, 2025 at approximately 4:22 PM, Aaron Whaley sent a message noting that he had added a Dropbox folder containing the entire file from Winton and Heistand and asked Sarena to review it for any depositions and expert reports.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, at about 12:11 PM, Sarena responded with: \u201cHere are the obvious items. There are several Zip Files that I need to double check tomorrow from a computer. Not sure my laptop can hold all the downloads, not knowing what is in them.\u201d A short time later, at approximately 12:40 PM, Aaron replied: \u201cOk, we need to get depositions of the driver of the All in Trucking semi. Sean Wilkes and get a 30(b)(6) deposition of All in Trucking.\u201d\n\nThese exchanges collectively reflect ongoing deposition planning, document collection, and status updates as the case moves toward scheduling and discovery milestones.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD.\n\nIn the Estate of RH, case number 23-CI-00074, counsel correspondence in March 2025 shows ongoing settlement negotiations regarding the related motor-vehicle matter. The forward chain begins with an email thread among Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, Blake V. Edwards, Esq., and others about a proposed settlement in the Estate of RH, with the subject Estate of RH (23-CI-00074).\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Blake V. Edwards, Esq., who represents Orozco, Alexsul, and Mr. Mikhail, wrote to Aaron Whaley. He explained that they had filed a Motion for Summary Judgment the previous week. Edwards noted that Mr. Mikhail was operating a semi and was able to come to a successful stop without striking anybody or anything, and he speculated that Mr. Hiestand had the case before Aaron. Edwards stated that his clients did not have anything to do with causing the accident with Aaron\u2019s client and asked whether he could send an Agreed Order of Partial Dismissal on those claims, inviting any questions. Edwards provided his contact information: Blake V. Edwards, Esq., Partner, 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1703; Direct Fax: 502.779.9348. The message also included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 2:33 PM, Aaron Whaley responded to Blake. Aaron thanked Blake for reaching out and said he was working on his reply to the various MSJs and asked whether Blake would be open to a nominal settlement. He referenced a global offer from all defendants at mediation and noted uncertainty about each party\u2019s contribution; he mentioned that Marc Lovell had taken a similar stance and that they had reached a nominal settlement to resolve him out of the litigation.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 3:51 PM, Blake replied with a money question: \u201cHow much are you thinking so I know when I report back to the adjuster? $2,500?\u201d He again provided his firm\u2019s contact details: Blake V. Edwards, Esq., Partner, 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1703; Direct Fax: 502.779.9348, together with the confidentiality notice.\n\nAlso on March 18, 2025, at 8:09 PM, Aaron sent another message to Blake, stating, \u201cI was thinking $5,000. Not far off considering.\u201d He again identified his law firm and address: Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; 502-583-4022, and reaffirmed the ongoing discussion about a settlement amount.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, at 10:15 AM, Blake asked Aaron, \u201cIs that a firm demand? If so, I will discuss with my adjuster.\u201d Aaron\u2019s reply at 12:08 PM was a brief confirmation: \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nLater on March 19, 2025, at 1:23 PM, Blake forwarded a reply stating, \u201cMy clients have accepted your client\u2019s demand of $5k, which is inclusive of all liens except PIP. Please send me your W-9 and instructions on how the settlement check should be made payable. In the meantime, I will prepare the settlement documents.\u201d This message closed with Blake\u2019s signature and confidentiality notice, along with the contact details for the SBM Kentucky office: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1703; Direct Fax: 502.779.9348.\n\nThe forwarded thread itself began with Aaron Whaley\u2019s initial reply on March 19, 2025 at 12:08 PM, simply replying \u201cyes\u201d to Blake\u2019s question about whether the amount discussed was a firm demand. The earlier message from Aaron on March 18, 2025 at 2:33 PM had indicated a willingness to consider a nominal settlement, as described above.\n\nThe exchange repeated several times in the forwarded content shows the same parties (Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm; Blake V. Edwards, Esq.; with copies to Daniel I. Wenig and Amelia Reesor) and the same contact details and confidentiality language present in the signatures. The key outcome reflected in the latest forward is that Blake\u2019s clients accepted the $5,000 settlement demand, inclusive of all liens except PIP, and Blake requested a W-9 and instructions for how the settlement check should be payable, with an affirmation that he would prepare the settlement documents.\n\nNext steps implied by the thread include providing the W-9 to Blake, detailing how the settlement check should be made payable, and the preparation of the settlement documents for the Estate of RH (23-CI-00074). The involved attorney contact details are as follows: Blake V. Edwards, Esq., Partner, SBM Kentucky (address provided in the signature: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1703; Direct Fax: 502.779.9348). For Whaley Law Firm, the contact is Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; 502-583-4022. The communications include standard confidentiality notices.",

The first message in the thread was sent at 12:58 PM from Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at the same firm, with Robyn Hester\u2019s file cc\u2019d. In that email, Aaron stated that he had attached his rough response to the defendants\u2019 MSJ, along with the original MSJ and an expert report from Linda Jones. He instructed that the response to MSJ be placed in the proper format for filing and asked Sarena to prepare a motion for late expert disclosure and an expert disclosure, noting that Linda Jones is the only expert. He requested confirmation of receipt and signed off with his contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.\n\nLater that day, at 2:18 PM, Sarena replied, confirming \u201cGot it,\u201d and again providing her contact details and noting the new email address. Her signature listed her role as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address and phone numbers, and the line to the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nIn a subsequent message around 2:49 PM, Sarena sent another note to Aaron with the subject \u201cHere is the Resp to DC MSJ - Working on Motion for Late Expert.\u201d In that email, she again identified herself as Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and provided the firm\u2019s contact details and the note to the new email address. This message appears to be part of the ongoing process to prepare and file the response to the MSJ and related motions.\n\nAt 3:33 PM on the same day, the original sender\u2019s thread continued with Sarena sending a further update titled \u201cHere is the Motion for Leave to File Expert Disclosures, the Proposed Order & the Expert Disclosures.\u201d In this communication, she noted that the only Expert Disclosure Template she currently had is for a Medical Expert, and she attached the Word version so Aaron could file in the A & B sections. She emphasized the importance of including all subjects and subject matters the expert may discuss and not missing anything. Her contact details were included again, with the reminder to use the new email address.\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications consistently reference Linda Jones as the sole expert, and the team discusses the preparation of a motion for late expert disclosure and an expert disclosure, the response to the MSJ, and the required formats and disclosures for filing. The communications also repeatedly provide the participants\u2019 names, firm affiliations, addresses, and contact information, including the new email address for Sarena Tuttle.",

He stated that he had included the original motion as well as an expert report from Linda Jones and asked that the response to MSJ be put in the proper filing format. He also requested the preparation of a motion for late expert disclosure and an expert disclosure, noting that the only expert is Linda Jones, and asked for confirmation of receipt of the email.

Thank you for getting back to me - April 18th will be fine.\u201d The messages again included the standard privilege disclosure.\n\nLater on March 19, 2025, at 11:41 AM (in the same thread), Bryce had previously circulated the discovery material and related notices, with the same attorney\u2011client disclaimer included at the end of the message chain.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, at approximately 11:10 AM, Bryce Koon wrote: \u201cGood morning Paige, Just circling back on these responses. Any updated appreciated.\u201d This message also carried the privilege disclaimer customary to the correspondence.\n\nFinally, on May 1, 2025, at 4:27:26 PM, Bryce Koon sent another follow\u2011up to the recipients: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Following up on these again.\u201d The May 1 note, like the earlier messages, was sent from The Whaley Law Firm and included the same standard privilege language.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the CC list remained consistent, including Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address, Sarena Tuttle, David Klapheke, Elizabeth Harbolt, and Linda Bandy. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207) and Paige Hornback\u2019s Dinsmore & Shohl contact block (101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202; T 502-540-2594; F 502-585-2207; E Paige.Hornback@dinsmore.com) appear in the signature blocks, along with the invitation not to forward privileged information if received in error. The messages also include standard notices that the communication may contain attorney\u2011client privileged material and should be treated accordingly.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022\nClient: Robyn Hester WD\n\nIn June 2025, the matter for Robyn Hester WD, associated with the Robyn-Hester-WD motor vehicle accident case, involved a settlement discussion related to the Bynum & Hester Estate. On Monday, June 23, 2025 at 09:09:47 AM (GMT-05:00), Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, forwarded an email thread to RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. Whaley\u2019s contact details were listed as Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022.\n\nThe forwarded chain contains a message from James R. (Jason) Coltharp, Jr., of Whitlow Law, addressed to Aaron G. Whaley and Jonathan Hollan (jhollan@kylawoffice.com). Dated Monday, June 23, 2025, at about 9:03 AM, the subject line read \u201cBynum & Hester Estate settlement.\u201d In the body, Jason stated that attached is a proposed release for Michael Bynum and the Robin Hester Estate\u2019s settlement with Ion Fetcu and OEG Express. He asked to be informed if any changes were required. He noted that he had a W-9 from Jon but not from Aaron. He stated that once he had assent to the release from both parties and a W-9 from Aaron, he would request Progressive to issue the payments.\n\nJason Coltharp signed as James R. (Jason) Coltharp, Jr., Member, and provided his contact information: jcoltharp@whitlow-law.com; Office phone 270-443-4516; Cell 270-519-7431. His mailing address was 300 Broadway, Post Office Box 995, Paducah, Kentucky 42002-0995, and his fax number was 270-443-4571. The firm\u2019s website is www.whitlow-law.com.\n\nThe message included an image attachment (described as: image001.png). The email contained a standard confidentiality notice stating that the message is intended only for the addressee and may contain privileged, confidential, and/or attorney work product information. It warned that reading, copying, retaining, or disseminating the message or attachments is inappropriate if you are not the intended recipient, and instructed the unintended recipient to contact the sender and delete all copies.

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022 concerns the client Robyn Hester WD and centers on the Hester Release. On October 13, 2025 at 2:24:13 a.m./p.m. (Eastern Time), Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Blake V. Edwards of SBMKY Law regarding the release, with RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, Daniel I. Wenig, and Amelia Reesor copied on the email. The subject line was \u201cRe: Hester Release,\u201d and the note said to see the attached documents.\n\nIn a follow-up dated October 13, 2025 at about 1:08 p.m., Blake V. Edwards replied to Aaron, indicating that they should follow up again before filing their Motion this week. Edwards\u2019 address and contact details were included in his signature, and the message contained the confidentially notice typical of firm correspondence.\n\nThe email thread shows a ongoing negotiation about whether to provide the executed settlement agreement or to file a Motion to Enforce. A prior exchange from October 3, 2025 (Blake\u2019s message to Aaron, with RobynHesterZ3... copied and Daniel Wenig and Amelia Reesor CC\u2019d) asked: \u201cAaron, Are you going to provide the executed settlement agreement or do we need to file the Motion to Enforce?\u201d\n\nEarlier, on September 17, 2025, Blake followed up again on the status of the executed Release, asking for an update.\n\nThe discussion traces back to September 2, 2025, when Aaron Whaley responded to Blake and RobynHesterZ3..., with Daniel Wenig and Amelia Reesor CC\u2019d. In his message, Aaron stated that what another party does or has agreed to has no persuasive effect for him on the issue at hand; his aim was to protect his client and ensure the language complies with Kentucky law rather than merely checking a box. He explained that other parties\u2019 actions may have persuasive effect on the Judge, and reminded Blake that if they could not reach an agreement, Blake would need to file a Motion to Enforce. He asked Blake to send a complete copy of the release with the new proposed language so that Aaron could determine whether the Sheriff would sign it; if not, Blake would need to file the motion. He quoted the language Blake had proposed at that time:\n\n\u201cSheriff Matt Hilbrecht signs this Release only in his capacity as an administrator of the Estate of R.H. pursuant to KRS 396.185. He is binding the estate, and neither he, nor the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Department, is personally bound or liable for the representations herein.\u201d\n\nAaron explained that his previous language was drafted to comply with KRS 396.185, which concerns the liability of a personal representative, and that omitting \u201cfiduciary\u201d from the proposed language ignored the statute\u2019s direct language. He noted that the statute states that a personal representative is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administering the estate only if the personal representative is personally at fault. Therefore, he argued that language stating that the personal representative is not \u201cpersonally bound or liable for the representations herein\u201d could directly contradict the statute. He stated that he had provided his rationale for why the language was not acceptable and asked why the language he proposed was not acceptable under Kentucky law. He proposed the following alternative language:\n\n\u201cSheriff Matt Hilbrecht signs this Release in his fiduciary capacity as the administrator of the Estate of R.H. pursuant to KRS \u00a7 396.185 and not in his personal capacity or official capacity with the Marshall County Sheriff.\u201d\n\nHe invited Blake to share his thoughts and suggested a phone conversation if needed.\n\nIn his later August 27, 2025 message, Aaron reiterated a revision for consideration, proposing to revise to say:\n\n\u201cSheriff Matt Hilbrecht signs this Release only in his capacity as an administrator of the Estate of R.H. pursuant to KRS 396.185. He is binding the estate, and neither he, nor the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Department, is personally bound or liable for the representations herein.\u201d\n\nAaron added that he did not think the language was necessary or that a judge would compel the Sheriff to sign Blake\u2019s preferred language. He observed that the original language he had requested\u2014which Blake had objected to\u2014had since been adopted by another party, and he noted that this had resulted in at least six parties having no problems with it (though the sentence ends there in the correspondence).\n\nIn sum, the October 13, 2025 emails reflect an ongoing effort to determine whether to file a Motion to Enforce or obtain the executed settlement agreement, and they document a dispute over the precise language governing Sheriff Matt Hilbrecht\u2019s signing of the Release in relation to KRS 396.185, including the tension between a fiduciary-capacity formulation versus language that might be read as personally binding.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robyn-Hester-WD-MVA-02-23-2022. Client: Robyn Hester WD. Re: Hester Release.\n\nOn November 4, 2025 at 10:57:43 AM (GMT-05:00), Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Blake V. Edwards at SBMKY Law, with Robyn Hester\u2019s file color-coded in the cc line to RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, Daniel I. Wenig, and Amelia Reesor. The subject was Re: Hester Release. In that message, Aaron stated, \u201cBlake, I did get the check. You can go ahead and file that.\u201d\n\nEarlier, on Friday, October 31, 2025 at 2:14 PM (the timestamp shows a question mark after the time), Blake Edwards had written to Aaron inquiring about the status of the delivery of the settlement check to determine whether he could proceed with filing the AOD. Blake explained that USPS attempted to deliver the check to Aaron\u2019s office on October 17, but no one was available to receive it. USPS\u2019s website indicated that a notice had been left at the office requesting a reschedule of delivery, which had not yet been done. Blake provided the USPS tracking link: https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction?qtc_tLabels1=9489017898203032574827. He asked, \u201cHave you received the check? Can we file the AOD?\u201d The email carried Blake\u2019s signature as \u201cBlake V. Edwards, Esq.\u2014Partner,\u201d with his office address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, and direct contact numbers. The message also included confidentiality language stating that the communication and attachments were intended for the recipient and protected by attorney-client/work product privileges, with instructions to notify the sender if received in error and to destroy the communication.\n\nIn the chain, Aaron had previously replied on October 13, 2025 at 2:24 PM with \u201cSee attached,\u201d to Blake\u2019s prior message, and the thread continued with further exchanges.\n\nOn Monday, October 13, 2025 at 1:08 PM, Blake wrote to Aaron: \u201cAaron Follow up again before we go forward with filing our Motion this week.\u201d The message included Blake\u2019s standard signature block.\n\nOn Friday, October 3, 2025 at 1:52 PM, Blake had written to Aaron and RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, with Robyn\u2019s email address included, and cc\u2019d Daniel I. Wenig and Amelia Reesor. The subject was RE: Hester Release. Blake asked, \u201cAaron, Are you going to provide the executed settlement agreement or do we need to file the Motion to Enforce?\u201d The note again contained Blake\u2019s contact information and the confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier, on Wednesday, September 17, 2025 at 3:10 PM, Blake sent another message to Aaron and RobynHesterZ3101900@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, with Daniel I. Wenig and Amelia Reesor cc\u2019d, titled RE: Hester Release. Blake wrote, \u201cAaron Following up on the status of the executed Release. Thanks.\u201d The message included Blake\u2019s standard signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nOn Tuesday, September 2, 2025 at 2:43 PM, Aaron replied to Blake, Robyn Hester, Daniel Wenig, and Amelia Reesor. His reply began with a substantive note: \u201cWhat another party does or has agreed to has no persuasive effect for me on this issue. I am simply trying to protect my client and have this language make sense and comply with Kentucky law rather than just checking a box and moving on.\u201d He added that what other parties do would have persuasive effect on the Judge, and that in their last conversation Blake had said he would file a motion to enforce the settlement if an agreement could not be reached. Aaron requested a complete copy of the release with Blake\u2019s new proposed language and stated he would see if the Sheriff would sign it; if not, Blake would need to file the motion. Aaron then quoted the language Blake had proposed at that time:\n\n\u201cSheriff Matt Hilbrecht signs this Release only in his capacity as an administrator of the Estate of R.H. pursuant to KRS 396.185. He is binding the estate, and neither he, nor the Marshall County Sheriff\u2019s Department, is personally bound or liable for the representations herein.\u201d\n\nAaron explained that his last proposed language had been drafted to comply with KRS 396.185, \u201cLiability of personal representative,\u201d while also considering Blake\u2019s proposed language. He argued that omitting \u201cfiduciary\u201d from the proposed language would ignore the statute\u2019s language, which states that \u201ca personal representative is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate or for torts committed in the course of the administration of the estate only if he is personally at fault.\u201d He stressed that they could not include language contradicting the statute by stating that the personal representative is NOT \u201cpersonally bound or liable for the representations herein.\u201d Aaron stated he had provided his rationale for why the language was not acceptable and asked why Blake\u2019s proposed language was not acceptable under Kentucky law. He closed by restating his proposed language:\n\n\u201cSheriff Matt Hilbrecht signs this Release in his fiduciary capacity as the administrator of the Estate of R.H. pursuant to KRS \u00a7 396.185 and not in his personal capacity or official capa[city].\u201d (The final word in the note truncates at \u201ccapa.\u201d)\n\nIn sum, the correspondence trail shows ongoing discussions through September, with a focus on obtaining an executed Release that complies with Kentucky law (KRS 396.185), determining whether an AOD (Order of Abatement of Debt) could be filed, and coordinating whether to file a Motion to Enforce the settlement agreement if the parties could not reach agreement on the release language. The records reflect multiple rounds of proposed language for the Release, dialogue about the Sheriff\u2019s personal versus fiduciary capacity, and requests to confirm delivery and receipt of the settlement check so that related filings could proceed.\n\nFinally, in the November 4, 2025 email from Aaron to Blake, Aaron confirmed receipt of the check and authorized Blake to proceed with filing that item.",
