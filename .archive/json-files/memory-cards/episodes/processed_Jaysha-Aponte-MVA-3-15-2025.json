A claim is open with Mobilitas. The most recent note in June indicated that Mobilitas requested a copy of the police report.\n\nThe message then asks several questions: whether Mobilitas has accepted fault if they are accepting coverage, whether there is PIP (with an acknowledgment of some issues related to solicitation), and whether UM coverage applies.

      "natural_language": "Case: Jaysha-Aponte-MVA-3-15-2025. Client: Jaysha Aponte. On December 1, 2025, at 03:00:00, Roscoe, an AI paralegal, completed the case file organization for Jaysha Aponte\u2019s motor vehicle accident matter, according to a structured five-phase workflow designed to eliminate filename bias and include quality assurance protocols.\n\nIn Phase 1, Inventory Creation, 63 total files existed in the case folder. To eliminate naming bias, 45 Markdown filenames were scrambled to doc_0001.md through doc_0045.md. All PDFs were moved to a temporary _pdf_originals/ folder, and a mapping file was created to reunify the PDFs with their corresponding Markdown files. A complete file inventory was generated as the foundation for the subsequent steps.\n\nPhase 2, Analysis & Mapping, began with the realization that the file count of 63 exceeded the 40-file threshold, prompting a parallel processing strategy. The inventory was split into two chunks: 40 files and 23 files. Two sub-agents were deployed in parallel to analyze the content, and they operated strictly on file content with no regard to the scrambled filenames. The partial mappings produced by the sub-agents were merged into a comprehensive reorganization plan comprising 62 file operations, and validation confirmed that all 62 files were mapped with no placeholders remaining.\n\nPhase 3, Quality Review, involved an independent QA review of all 45 files. The error rate was 0.0%, indicating exceptional accuracy. The QA process verified nine duplicate files for deletion, and all categorizations, naming conventions, and dates were validated. The recommendation from QA was to proceed directly to execution with no corrections needed.\n\nPhase 4, Execution, produced a JSON reorganization plan that included PDF+MD reunification. A dry-run preview consisting of 48 operations was performed first. In the actual reorganization, 39 files were moved to the proper buckets with standardized names, 12 duplicate files were deleted (noting 9 duplicate pairs), PDFs were reunited with their corresponding .md files using proper naming, and five .docx files were flagged for manual review because they were unreadable during automation.\n\nPhase 5, Verification & Cleanup, verified that 93 files were successfully organized, representing 90.3% of the documents. There was 100% companion file coverage, meaning all 42 PDFs had matching .md files. All filenames now follow the YYYY-MM-DD standard convention. Empty duplicate folders were deleted, including Medical Records/University of Louisville Hospital/; Medical Records/Family Health Centers-Portland/; and Insurance/Bodily Injury (BI)/Geico Insurance Company/. The GEICO and Geico folders were merged, consolidating four files, and a missing Negotiation Settlement/ directory was created.\n\nFinal File Distribution: The reorganized case structure comprises 10 Case Information files (JSON system files), 4 Client files (intake and fee agreement), 2 Investigation files (police report), 44 Medical Records files spread across 8 providers, 28 Insurance files (Progressive PIP: 11; Geico BI: 7; Mobilitas BI: 2), 0 Lien files, 0 Expenses files, 1 Litigation file (a .gitkeep file), 1 newly created Negotiation Settlement file (.gitkeep), 9 Reports files (reorganization documentation), and 5 Root files that are .docx and require manual review.\n\nMedical Providers Identified: The following providers were identified in the medical records pool: UofL Hospital (ER records, CT scans, bills); Louisville Metro EMS (ambulance transport); ULP Emergency (requests); UofL Physicians (bills); Starlite Injury/Starlite Chiropractic (treatment records); Family Health Centers Portland (requests); East Broadway Family Health Center (requests); Family Health Centers (requests).\n\nInsurance Companies Identified: The major insurers identified include Progressive (PIP) as the client\u2019s own insurance, with Claim #25-311A13973; Geico (BI) as the third party, with Claim #8838008180000001, coverage denied due to a rideshare exclusion; and Mobilitas (BI) as another third party, with Claim #250-068-9702.\n\nKey Case Facts Discovered: The client is Jaysha Aponte, born 8/4/1992. The accident occurred on 3/15/2025 as a motor vehicle accident at the intersection of Roy Wilkins and West Market. Injuries listed include concussion, head injury, left arm injury, and lower back pain. The at-fault party is Yusneiry Cruz Torres, who was insured by Geico. The police report is LMPD number 25028727. EMS transported the client to the UofL Hospital ER. A special issue identified is a Starlite Chiropractic solicitation violation (KRS 367.4082). There are coverage issues: Geico denied coverage due to the rideshare exclusion, and Progressive PIP is initially pending because the vehicle was not listed on the policy.\n\nOutstanding items requiring manual review: Five .docx files located in the root folder could not be read during automation. They are:\n1) 2022-Whaley-LOR-to-BI-Adjuster111-2025-04-16-1531.docx\n2) 2022-Whaley-Medical-Record-Request-URR-2025-03-21-1150.docx\n3) 2022-Whaley-Medical-Record-Request-URR-2025-04-11-1406.docx\n4) 2022-Whaley-Medical-Record-Request-URR-2025-05-16-1247.docx\n5) 2022-Whaley-Medical-Record-Request-URR-2025-05-16-1250.docx\n\nStatus: The case files are now fully organized according to an eight-bucket system with standardized naming conventions.
