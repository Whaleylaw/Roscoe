The client is Daniel W Volk.\n\nOn August 23, 2022, Ebon I. Moore of Liberty Mutual Claims wrote in response to a demand letter dated August 4, 2022. After reviewing the information provided, Moore offered the client $1,000 in new money. The message included standard contact and tracking details for Liberty Mutual, and it noted the sender’s role and contact information: Ebon I. Moore, CPCU, Liberty Mutual Claims, PO Box 5014, Scranton, PA 18505-5014, 317-805-2834. The email was sent to Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, with a copy to the client file address DanielWVolkMVAZ954620@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nThe following day, August 24, 2022, Whaley replied to Moore. He stated that he could not accept the offer at that time. He explained that Mr. Volk continues to experience neck and shoulder pain as well as radicular symptoms. Mr. Volk has been unable to follow up due to surgery to remove a brain meningioma. After he has recovered, he intends to pursue potential surgical options as advised by Aptiva Health on his December 28 follow-up exam. Whaley also noted that he has a copy of Mr. Volk’s December page showing Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist (UIM) coverage, but the page does not provide the policy limits, and he requested that Liberty Mutual disclose the UIM limits.\n\nThe August 23, 2022 email from Moore, addressed to Whaley, stated that the department had reviewed the information and that Liberty Mutual was offering $1,000 in new money for the client, and it invited further discussion after Whaley reviewed the offer with his client. Moore signed as part of Liberty Mutual Claims and included the usual online claim-tracking language, along with a reminder to view claim status, payment information, and the claim representative’s information. The message also contained the standard policy disclaimers indicating the policy is underwritten by Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, with Safeco Insurance Company of America as the sender of the email and its affiliates licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe correspondence chain includes the case’s CC address to Daniel Volk’s file, the case metadata (Claim-Number 047060829; Exposure-Number 04; Category: Manual Outbound E-Mail; Template-Id: BIFREEFORM_SF), and a note that the policy is underwritten by Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois.

I attached the records and bills I have so far.” This indicated that Daniel Volk was still receiving medical treatment and that the attorney was seeking to have the remaining financial balance forwarded to his office, along with the attached records and bills he had accumulated up to that point.\n\nBethany Pineda responded on December 20, 2022 at 1:59 PM. Her reply began with, “Good Afternoon, Please see attached.” Her message also included a signature block identifying her role as a “Claim Resolution Specialist III” in “Medical Claims” for Liberty Mutual Insurance | Safeco Insurance, with the mailing address PO Box 5014, Scranton, PA 18505-5014. She provided direct contact details: Office: 856-435-2864; Toll Free: 800-304-2896; Fax: 888-268-8840; Medical Provider Billing Support Phone: 888-288-7218; Email: LibertyPCC@mitchell.com; and submission instructions for bills to imaging@libertymutual.com or to P.O. Box 5014 Scranton, PA 18505-5014. The email also included Liberty Mutual’s notice about confidentiality and privileged information, informing recipients to delete or notify the sender if received in error, and detailing measures to correct address records if the email was misdirected.\n\nThe thread also shows an earlier exchange dated December 16, 2022 at 12:09 PM, with Aaron Whaley writing to Bethany Pineda (cc: DanielWVolkMVAZ954620@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) under the subject “{EXTERNAL} Daniel Volk #047060829.” In that message, Whaley stated: “Bethany, just following up on my voicemail. Could you please forward an updated pip log to me? Thanks.” The signature block identified Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone number 502-583-4022.\n\nThroughout the chain, the case is identified by the lead client Daniel W Volk, and the file references include the filevine CC address and the subject line Daniel Volk #047060829. The communications reflect active medical treatment for Mr. Volk, ongoing bills totaling over $22,000, and a request to Liberty Mutual to send any remaining balance to the attorney’s office, along with requests for an updated Personal Injury Protect (PIP) log. The messages include standard Liberty Mutual contact information, a confidentiality disclaimer, and instructions for submitting medical bills.",

I listened to your message and I\nwanted to email you in the hopes of clearing up our position. You made a\nstatement in the voicemail that is not supported by any documentation. You\nsaid that the headaches were caused by neck pain, which led to the MRI that\nfound the meningioma. No medical record supports that conclusion. A brain\nMRI for radiating neck pain is not normal. I want to give you a\nhypothetical.\n\nDan lives his life normally. Dan doesn't have any neck pain. However, Dan\nhas a C3-C4 herniated disc in his neck. This herniated disc is not causing\nany stenosis and there are no symptoms from the herniated disc. If this was\nfound on an MRI, the doctors would not perform surgery to correct it since\nit was asymptomatic. No doctor would be able to say within a reasonable\ndegree of medical certainty that the herniated disc would ever become\nsymptomatic. Now, Dan gets into an accident. He was hit from behind. After\nthe accident, he begins to have symptoms related to the herniated disc. The\nAsymptomatic has become Symptomatic. His doctor then performs surgery to\ncorrect the herniated disc.\n\nIn the above example, you would have no problem agreeing that the accident\ncaused an aggravation of a preexisting condition. There would be no issue\nwith relating the surgery to correct the herniated disc to the accident.\n\nReplace herniated disc with mengioma in the example and you have the exact\nsame thing as here. There is no way to know if the menengioma would have\never become symptomatic. It may have sat there in his head, doing nothing.\nHowever, after the trauma of the accident, the mengioma became syptomatic\nand had to be removed. That means the need for removal was caused by the\naccident, just as the herinated disc repair was in the hypothetical.\n\nYou cannot think of the meningioma as if it were some cancerous brain\ntumor. If it was, then yes, it would have to come out or be treated in some\nway at some point. The accident could then be viewed as a happy misfortune.\nA meningioma is not the same. They are not cancers. They do not grow\naggressively. They do not have to be removed if they are not causing\nsymptoms.\n\nHere is a link to some information on Meningioma treatment. Notice the\nfirst paragraph: \"Meningioma treatment is not always necessary, especially\nin situations where the tumors are small, noncancerous, and not causing the\npatient any discomfort. Benign meningiomas may be addressed with “watchful\nwaiting,” in which physicians carefully monitor a patient with regular\nimaging scans and physical exams but do not make any treatment\nrecommendations unless symptoms develop or the tumor starts to spread.\"\n\nhttps://www.moffitt.org/cancers/meningioma/treatment/\n\nI have attached the 12/13/2021 Norton Cancer Institute record as well.\n\"This lesion was discovered upon headaches after motor vehicle accident.\"--\n\nKim, We know this to be true. Prior to the accident, Dan had an\nasymptomatic meningioma. There is no evidence that it would have needed\nremoval at any future time. After the accident, the meningioma became\nsymptomatic and needed to be removed. BECASUE THE ACCIDENT CAUSED THE\nMENINGIOMA TO BECOME SYMPTOMATIC.\n\nThanks.\n\nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022",
      "natural_language": "Case: Daniel-W-Volk-MVA-09-24-2021. Client: Daniel W Volk. This notes file shows an email thread from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Kimberle Pishke and the Daniel Volk Filevine project address, regarding the motor vehicle accident case involving Daniel W Volk on September 24, 2021.\n\nIn the email, Aaron Whaley begins by addressing Kim: “Kim, thank you for the call earlier. I listened to your message and I wanted to email you in the hopes of clearing up our position.” He states that Kim’s voicemail claim is not supported by any documentation and that she said the headaches were caused by neck pain, which led to an MRI that found the meningioma. He notes that no medical record supports that conclusion and provides a hypothetical to illustrate his point.\n\nThe hypothetical envisions Dan living his life normally with no neck pain, but having a C3-C4 herniated disc in his neck that is asymptomatic and not causing stenosis. If such a disc were found on an MRI, doctors would not perform surgery to correct it since it is asymptomatic, and there would be no reasonable medical certainty that the herniated disc would ever become symptomatic. After an accident where Dan is hit from behind, he would begin to have symptoms related to the preexisting disc, turning the asymptomatic issue into a symptomatic one, and a doctor would then perform surgery to correct the disc. In this example, there would be no problem agreeing that the accident caused an aggravation of a preexisting condition and that the surgery could be related to the accident.\n\nWhaley then asks the reader to replace the herniated disc with a meningioma in the same scenario and notes that it would yield the identical conclusion: there is no way to know whether the meningioma would have ever become symptomatic on its own. It might have remained inert, but after the trauma of the accident the meningioma could become symptomatic and require removal. Accordingly, the need for removal would be caused by the accident in the same way as the hypothetical disc surgery would be.\n\nWhaley cautions against viewing the meningioma as a cancerous brain tumor, noting that meningiomas are not cancers; they do not grow aggressively and do not have to be removed if they are not causing symptoms. He provides a link to information on Meningioma treatment, with the first paragraph quoted: “Meningioma treatment is not always necessary, especially in situations where the tumors are small, noncancerous, and not causing the patient any discomfort. Benign meningiomas may be addressed with ‘watchful waiting,’ in which physicians carefully monitor a patient with regular imaging scans and physical exams but do not make any treatment recommendations unless symptoms develop or the tumor starts to spread.” The link provided is https://www.moffitt.org/cancers/meningioma/treatment/.\n\nWhaley also states that he has attached the Norton Cancer Institute record dated December 13, 2021. He quotes the Norton note: “This lesion was discovered upon headaches after motor vehicle accident.” He reiterates Kim’s truth claims: prior to the accident, Dan had an asymptomatic meningioma; there is no evidence that it would have needed removal at any future time; after the accident, the meningioma became symptomatic and needed to be removed, because the accident caused the meningioma to become symptomatic.\n\nThe message closes with thanks and Aaron Whaley’s contact information: Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022.

Volk MVA 9/24/21 - Filevine Project Email Address [DanielWVolkMVAZ954620@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com](mailto:DanielWVolkMVAZ954620@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com)\n\nKim, thank you for your time and thoughtful response. I will address your\nresponse in order.\n1. You state that Mr. Volk's headaches could be from the cervicle injury,\nand his doctors do not attribute his headaches to the meningioma.\nYes, cervical injuries can result in referred pain to the head. However,\neven if his neck injury caused some headache symptoms, his doctor states\nthat the meningioma is the cause. Additionally, Mr. Volk had other symptoms\nrelated to the meningioma that he did not have before. On 12/13.21, Dr.\nSorah notes that Dan is having intermittent left hemibody sensation changes\nmost predominant in the leg. Mr. Völk saw Dr. Sun on 01/22/2022. Dr. Sun\nnotes headaches as well as intermittent paresthesias in his left lower\nextremity as symptoms of the meningioma. What is important is that before\nthe accident there were no headaches, no parasthesia, and no sensation\nissues. After the accident, the symptoms develop. Additionally, I just saw\nthat the MRI also showed a small amount of edema, or swelling around the\nmeningioma. None of the Dr's address the significance of the edema, but\nthat sure does sound to me like it could be the result of the trauma, which\nis why he is now symptomatic.\n\n2. Mr. Volk could do nothing or have surgery. Mr. Volk chose surgery, so\nit's not related to the accident.\nUnless a person is in an ER, all surgery is a choice. A person with a\nherniated disc has a choice for a spinal fusion or do nothing. If they\nchoose surgery, that would not mean the accident did not lead to the choice\nand therefore the surgery. Additionally, in the present case, Mr. Volk did\nhave a choice but his doctor recommended surgery. Dr. Sun on 4/29/22 lays\nout options of continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy. He\nthen goes on to recommend craniotomy.\n3. You claim that he would have had to have the meningioma removed\neventually.\nHis doctor giving him the option of continuing surveillance directly\ncontradicts that. You cite a paragraph from Mt. Sinai Hospital's website\nfor the proposition that meningioma must be removed. Yet, on that same\nwebsite, on the page about treatment of meningioma, there is this\nparagraph:If your tumor is growing slowly and does not affect your health,\nwe may choose to observe your tumor at scheduled intervals rather than\ntreat it immediately. We might schedule you for regular magnetic resonance\nimaging scans to\nmonitor the tumor's growth.\"\nhttps://www.mountsinai.org/care/neurosurgery/services/meningiomas/treatments-procedures\nSo, your own source says that sometimes just watching and waiting is an\noption. Just like Mr. Volk's Dr.'s.\n\nAt the end of the day, these are the uncontroverted facts.\n1. Prior to the accident, Mr. Volk did not have a problem with headaches or\nleg parasthesia.\n2. After the accident, Mr. Volk had persistent headaches that led to a\nbrain MRI.\n3. The brain MRI revealed a small meningioma.\n4. Mr. Volk's neurologist and cancer doctor both relate that the headaches\nand the parasthesia he was experiencing were due to the meningioma.\n5. Mr. Volks neurologist recommended surgical removal of the\nmeningoma, which Mr. Volk agreed to.\n6. Mr. Volk undergoes a craniotomy.\n\nSo, either as a manner of great coincidence, Mr. Volk has a meningioma that\nis completely asymptomatic until immediately following a car accident and\nwholly unrelated to the car accident; he then begins to have symptoms and\nsubsequent removal of the meningioma\nor\nMr. Volk has an asymptomatic meningioma that becomes symptomatic after the\ntrauma of the car accident and has to have it removed.\n\nThank you. Have a great day.\n\nOn Tue, Aug 27, 2024 at 10:28?AM Pischke, Kimberle <\nkimberle.pischke@libertymutual.com> wrote:\n\n>\n>\n> Aaron,\n>\n>\n>\n> Thank you for your response.

      "natural_language": "Daniel W Volk was the client in a motor vehicle accident on September 24, 2021, with the matter docketed as Daniel-W-Volk-MVA-09-24-2021 and claim number 047060829-04. In a message titled Re: Dan Volk #047060829 Claim#:047060829-04, sent by Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, he addressed Liberty Mutual claims handler Kimberle Pischke and the Daniel W Volk MVA 9/24/21 Filevine project email address. Whaley thanked Pischke for her time and thoughtfully laid out his response in order. He argued that while cervical injuries can cause headaches, Volk’s doctors attribute the headaches to a meningioma; he noted that Volk had other symptoms related to the meningioma that were not present before the accident. Specifically, on December 13, 2021, Dr. Sorah documented intermittent left hemibody sensation changes, most pronounced in the leg, and Volk saw Dr. Sun on January 22, 2022, who noted headaches and intermittent paresthesias in Volk’s left lower extremity as symptoms of the meningioma. Whaley stressed that before the accident Volk had no headaches, no paresthesias, and no sensation issues, and that after the accident the symptoms developed. He also highlighted that an MRI showed a small amount of edema around the meningioma, a finding none of the doctors had addressed for its significance, but which Whaley believed could reflect trauma-related effects contributing to Volk’s current symptoms. Regarding treatment, Whaley pointed out that Volk’s options were not limited to doing nothing; Dr. Sun, on April 29, 2022, laid out options of continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy, and ultimately recommended craniotomy. Whaley argued that the presence of options for surveillance does not negate the possibility that the accident contributed to Volk’s condition and warranted consideration of a causally related surgery. He also noted that while it was often said that a meningioma would have to be removed eventually, Dr. Volk’s doctor had offered continued surveillance, which directly contradicted the proposition that removal would be inevitable. Whaley cited a paragraph from Mount Sinai Hospital’s website stating that if a tumor is growing slowly and does not affect health, observation with regular MRI scans is an option, thereby suggesting that watchful waiting can be appropriate in some cases, just as Volk’s doctors had suggested. He concluded by enumerating what he claimed to be uncontroverted facts: (1) prior to the accident Volk had no headaches or leg paresthesias; (2) after the accident Volk developed persistent headaches leading to an MRI; (3) the MRI revealed a small meningioma; (4) Volk’s neurologist and cancer doctor both related the headaches and paresthesias to the meningioma; (5) Volk’s neurologist recommended surgical removal, which Volk agreed to; and (6) Volk underwent a craniotomy. He framed the situation as either a remarkable coincidence—an asymptomatic meningioma that became symptomatic only after the car accident and required removal—or as a tumor that was asymptomatic but became symptomatic following the trauma and necessitated removal. He closed with thanks and best wishes.\n\nLiberty Mutual’s response to Whaley’s message, dated August 27, 2024, from Kimberle Pischke, clarified that it is possible Volk’s neck pain from the whiplash could have contributed to headaches after the MVA and that cervical pain can cause referred head pain. Pischke shared that she had researched the issue and found articles supporting cervicogenic headaches, including a StatPearls entry, noting that neck injuries from whiplash can lead to headaches and that the MRI was taken due to ongoing cervical radiculitis and headaches. She asserted that Volk’s treatment notes describe the meningioma as an incidental finding following the MVA and attached multiple treatment records to support the claim. She referenced Dr. Sorah’s note for 12/15/21, which states the meningioma was discovered on MRI and attributes this discovery to headaches after an MVA, though she acknowledged that the note did not explicitly state it was discovered due to headaches after the MVA. She also noted that Dr. Sun indicated in his notes that Volk could do nothing about the tumor and follow up in six months, or choose surgery and radiation; Volk chose to undergo surgery, which Pischke argued was Volk’s decision rather than a consequence of the accident. She cited a Mount Sinai article stating that leaving a meningioma untreated can lead to growth and various symptoms, arguing that there is evidence both for observation and removal, and suggested that neither party is a medical professional. Pischke concluded by reiterating that Volk’s rear-end collision involved a whiplash-type injury and cervical radiculitis, which she argued is more likely to be the cause of the headaches than an incidental brain tumor finding supported by medical records. She stated that the offer remained at $25,276.00 exclusive of PIP and invited further discussion if more information emerged. The message included her contact information and a confidentiality notice stating that the email and attachments are intended only for the addressees and may contain privileged information.\n\nIn addition to the discussion, the note contains the standard confidentiality disclaimer accompanying Liberty Mutual communications.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the Daniel W Volk motor vehicle accident case (case name Daniel-W-Volk-MVA-09-24-2021) and the related claim file notes, including the August 2024 email exchange between Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law and Liberty Mutual claims representative Kimberle Pischke regarding causation, treatment choices, and settlement offers.\n\nThe case involves Daniel W Volk (the client) and concerns claim number 047060829-04. The header for the correspondence identifies the matter as “Re: Dan Volk #047060829 Claim#:047060829-04” and notes that the communication came from Aaron Whaley to Kimberle Pischke and a Filevine project inbox on September 5, 2024.\n\nIn an August 27, 2024 email, Aaron Whaley addressed Kimberle Pischke and began with a courteous opening: “Kim, thank you for your time and thoughtful response. I will address your response in order,” and then proceeded to outline three main points he attributed to Kim’s prior position. First, he stated that Kim had suggested Mr. Volk’s headaches could be from a cervical injury and that his doctors did not attribute the headaches to the meningioma. He acknowledged that cervical injuries can cause referred head pain but argued that, even if the neck injury contributed some headache symptoms, Mr. Volk’s doctors nonetheless attribute the headaches to the meningioma. He emphasized that Mr. Volk had other meningioma–related symptoms after the accident that he did not have beforehand. Specifically, he cited a December 13, 2021 entry by Dr. Sorah noting intermittent left-hemibody sensation changes, most prominent in the leg; he noted that Mr. Volk saw Dr. Sun on January 22, 2022, who documented headaches as well as intermittent paresthesias in the left lower extremity as symptoms of the meningioma. He stressed that prior to the accident there were no headaches, no paresthesias, and no sensory issues; after the accident, symptoms developed. He also mentioned that the MRI showed a small amount of edema (swelling) around the meningioma, adding that none of the doctors address the significance of the edema, but suggesting it could be a trauma-related finding explaining why Mr. Volk became symptomatic.\n\nSecond, Aaron asserted that Mr. Volk had a choice between doing nothing and undergoing surgery, and that Mr. Volk chose surgery, implying the decision was not caused by the accident. He argued that, except in an emergency department setting, surgery is a choice, just as a person with a herniated disc may choose spinal fusion or to do nothing; if a patient chooses surgery, that does not mean the accident did not lead to or influence the decision. He noted that Dr. Sun, on April 29, 2022, laid out options such as continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy, and that Dr. Sun recommended craniotomy.\n\nThird, Aaron challenged a contention that Mr. Volk would have had to have the meningioma removed at some future time. He argued that the doctor’s option of continuing surveillance directly contradicts the proposition that removal was inevitable. He cited a Mount Sinai Hospital page that discusses treatment options and noted that the same site also states that “If your tumor is growing slowly and does not affect your health, we may choose to observe your tumor at scheduled intervals rather than treat it immediately,” including the possibility of regular MRI monitoring. He used this to argue that watchful waiting can be an option, just as it is in Mr. Volk’s case with medical opinions supporting continued surveillance.\n\nAaron then summarized what he deemed the uncontroverted facts:\n1) Prior to the accident, Mr. Volk did not have headaches or leg paresthesias.\n2) After the accident, Mr. Volk developed persistent headaches that led to a brain MRI.\n3) The brain MRI revealed a small meningioma.\n4) Mr. Volk’s neurologist and cancer doctor both related the headaches and the paresthesias to the meningioma.\n5) Mr. Volk’s neurologist recommended surgical removal of the meningioma, which Mr. Volk agreed to.\n6) Mr. Volk underwent a craniotomy.\n\nHe presented the two possible narratives: either the meningioma was asymptomatic until immediately after the car accident and then became symptomatic and was removed, or it was asymptomatic and only became symptomatic after the trauma, necessitating removal.\n\nKimberle Pischke replied on the same day, August 27, 2024, at 10:28 AM. She began by apologizing for a perceived misunderstanding of her prior voicemail, clarifying that she had said it was possible Mr. Volk’s neck pain could have contributed to headaches after the whiplash-like injury, noting that neck pain was documented in Result Physiotherapy’s records. She stated she conducted research and found internet articles indicating that headaches can be caused by cervical pain, such as cervicogenic headaches, which are described as referred pain from the neck to the head. She provided links to sources, including a Google search result on cervical pain causing headaches and the StatPearls entry on Cervicogenic Headache (NIH). She asserted that Mr. Volk was rear-ended, which would be consistent with a whiplash-type injury and headaches that could lead to an MRI of the head.\n\nKimberle explained that the MRI was performed due to continued cervical radiculitis and headaches, referencing Dr. Gilbert’s notes and Mr. Volk’s own statements that the meningioma was an incidental finding following the MVA. She stated she attached multiple treatment records that describe the meningioma as an incidental finding after the MVA. She referenced Dr. Sorah’s note for the date of service 12/15/21, which indicated that the meningioma was discovered on an MRI and that this discovery was related to headaches following the MVA; she clarified that the note does not assert that headaches were caused by the tumor, but rather that the tumor was discovered because of headaches after the MVA. If anything was missing in that note, she asked for clarification.\n\nKimberle also referenced Dr. Sun’s notes to Mr. Volk, which indicated that he could do nothing about the tumor and follow up in 6 months with monitoring, or he could choose surgery and radiation treatment; she stated that Mr. Volk chose to have the surgery even though he could do nothing, arguing that the surgery was therefore the client’s choice and not caused by the accident. She noted that Dr. Sun’s 4/29/22 notes laid out continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy as options, with a recommendation for craniotomy.\n\nAddressing the question of whether the tumor would necessarily have to be removed at some future time, Kimberle argued that this was contradicted by the Mount Sinai information she cited. She pointed to Mount Sinai’s treatment page, which acknowledges observation as a possible option if the tumor is growing slowly and not yet affecting health, including scheduling regular MRI scans to monitor growth. She argued that the Mount Sinai source indicates that sometimes watching and waiting is an option, just as Mr. Volk’s doctors have suggested.\n\nKimberle summarized the practical conclusion from her perspective: neither party is a doctor, Mr. Volk was rear-ended in the accident with a whiplash-type injury and cervical radiculitis, which she believed was more likely the cause of the headaches than an incidental brain tumor finding, and she stated that the treatment and medical records do support this position. Her closing offer remained $25,276.00 exclusive of PIP, and she invited further information or discussion if there was additional data.\n\nIn addition to the substantive content of the two emails, the note included explicit reference to the asserted “incidental finding” nature of the meningioma in the context of the accident, to the existence of MRI findings such as edema around the tumor, and to the treatment options discussed by Dr. Sun (surveillance, craniotomy, radiation) and the eventual decision for craniotomy. The exchange also referenced the timing of various medical notes: Dr. Sorah’s note on 12/13/21 (intermittent left-hemibody sensation changes, most prominent in the leg), a note by Dr. Sun on 01/22/2022 (headaches and intermittent paresthesias in the left lower extremity as symptoms of the meningioma), and Dr. Sun’s 04/29/2022 recommendations including craniotomy. The MRI note dated 12/15/21 documented the discovery of the meningioma, associated with headaches after the MVA, according to Dr. Sorah’s date-of-service reference, and the sense that the tumor was discovered as a consequence of headaches rather than being proven to cause them in that note.\n\nIn sum, the case file presents a debate over causation and relationship between the MVA and the meningioma-related symptoms. Aaron Whaley argued that the accident likely contributed to symptomatic presentation via the tumor and edema, that the surgery was not simply a pre-existing, accident-independent choice, and that the uncontroverted facts point toward a link between the accident and subsequent medical decisions. Kimberle Pischke argued that cervical injury and whiplash could reasonably explain headaches, that the MRI findings included an incidental tumor discovered after the MVA, and that the patient’s decision to undergo surgery was ultimately his choice, not a direct result of the accident; she also cited sources supporting watchful waiting as a valid approach for certain meningiomas and maintained her settlement offer of $25,276.00 exclusive of PIP.\n\nThe exchange thus reflects competing interpretations of causation and clinical course, anchored by the six enumerated facts Aaron listed as uncontroverted, and the emphasis by both sides on the nature of the tumor as an incidental finding versus a tumor that may be related to post-accident symptoms, along with the legal and settlement implications of those interpretations.",

The accident does not need\nto cause the tumor for it to be compensable. The accident needs to cause\nthe symptoms from the tumor to appear. He was completely asymptomatic prior\nto the accident. The force of the accident caused the tumor to shift\nslightly and that leads to the symptoms. The fact that the tumor is now\nsymptomatic is why it had to be removed. This is exactly like a\npre-existing herniated disc that is asymptomatic prior to an accident. The\naccident causes the herniated disc to shift and it is now pressing on\nnerves and causing symptoms.\n\nThe day of the accident Dan goes to OSF Prompt Care. He does not report\nneck pain. He does report a headache along the left temporal and parietal\nregion. Headaches from whiplash or referred neck pain are most commonly at\nthe base of the skull near the neck. Dan had a headache that was in the\nleft temproal lobe and left parietal lobe. Basically the side of the head\nnear the ear to the top of the head in the middle. Not at all what you\nwould expect from a whiplash injury. It is, however, what you would expect\nfrom a headache caused by the meningioma. His headaches were caused by the\nmeningioma. Not whiplash. There were no headaches before the accident. So\nthe accident caused the headaches from the meningioma.\n\nYou keep mentioning that the meningioma was an incidental finding as if\nthat has some relevance. It isn't. It just means it was not something they\nwere looking for when they did the brain MRI.\n\nOn Fri, Sep 6, 2024 at 7:57?AM Pischke, Kimberle <\nkimberle.pischke@libertymutual.com> wrote:\n\n> Aaron,\n>\n>\n>\n> I am doing well, thanks for asking.\n>\n>\n>\n> In response to your previous email, as I had indicated and pointed out in\n> the medical records Dr. Piticock, Dr. Gilbert and Dr. Sorah have all\n> indicated the meningioma was an incidental finding after complaints of\n> headaches after the accident, they do not indicate the tumor was caused by\n> the accident.\n>\n>\n>\n> I am willing to increase my offer exclusive of PIP of $28,500 new money\n> to resolve the claim.\n>\n>\n>\n> Best Regards,\n>\n>\n>\n> *Kim Pischke *\n>\n> Sr. Claims Resolution Specialist III, Cas\n>\n> ------------\n>\n> USRM Casualty Claims\n>\n> *USPS Mail (no FedEx or UPS): *P.O.

      "natural_language": "This case concerns Daniel W Volk and a motor vehicle accident that occurred on September 24, 2021, designated as the MVA in the file Volk-MVA-09-24-2021. The claim number is 047060829-04. The narrative below reflects the communications between Daniel Volk’s representation and Liberty Mutual, along with the medical facts and the positions taken over time.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Liberty Mutual claims representative Kimberle Pischke and to the Filevine project address for the Volk MVA file. In his message, Whaley stressed that he never claimed the accident caused the brain tumor. He explained that an accident does not need to cause a tumor to be compensable; rather, it must cause the symptoms emanating from the tumor to appear. He asserted that Daniel Volk was completely asymptomatic before the accident and that the force of the collision caused the tumor to shift slightly, which then led to the appearance of symptoms. Because the tumor became symptomatic, it had to be removed. Whaley likened this to a pre-existing herniated disc that is asymptomatic prior to an accident: the accident causes the disc to shift and press on nerves, producing symptoms.\n\nWhaley also described the events of the day of the accident, noting that Dan Volk went to OSF Prompt Care and did not report neck pain, but did report a headache localized to the left temporal and parietal regions of the brain. He characterized headaches from whiplash or referred neck pain as typically at the base of the skull near the neck, whereas Volk’s headaches were in the left temporal and left parietal areas—essentially the side of the head near the ear up to the top of the head. Whaley argued that this presentation is not what one would expect from whiplash and is instead consistent with headaches caused by a meningioma. He emphasized that Volk had no headaches before the accident, so the accident was what caused the headaches associated with the meningioma.\n\nWhaley rejected the notion that the meningioma was merely an incidental finding with relevance only in that it was not initially looked for during the brain MRI. He stated that incidental findings are incidental only in terms of being unlooked for, not that they are irrelevant to causation.\n\nIn response to Whaley’s email, on the morning of September 6, 2024, Kimberle Pischke replied. She indicated that, based on the medical records, doctors Piticock, Gilbert, and Sorah had all noted the meningioma as an incidental finding following complaints of headaches after the accident, and they did not attribute the tumor’s existence to the accident. She also indicated a willingness to increase Liberty Mutual’s offer to $28,500 in new money, exclusive of PIP (personal injury protection), to resolve the claim.\n\nThe email thread also contained the routine attorney communications from the prior day, September 5, 2024, when Aaron Whaley had written to Kim Pischke and to Daniel Volk’s Filevine address. In that exchange, Whaley set forth a structured argument in three parts:\n\n1) He acknowledged that the defense’s position—stating that Volk’s headaches could be due to a cervical injury and that the doctors did not attribute the headaches to the meningioma—could be countered. Whaley argued that while a cervical injury can produce referred head pain, the doctors nevertheless attributed the headaches and other symptoms to the meningioma. He pointed to post-accident records: on December 13, 2021, Dr. Sorah noted intermittent left-hemibody sensation changes most predominant in the leg; on January 22, 2022, Dr. Sun documented headaches as well as intermittent paresthesias in Volk’s left lower extremity as symptoms of the meningioma. He stressed that prior to the accident there were no headaches, no paresthesias, and no sensation issues; after the accident, symptoms developed. He also noted MRI evidence of a small amount of edema around the meningioma and suggested this edema could be trauma-related, contributing to Volk becoming symptomatic.\n\n2) He addressed the assertion that Volk could do nothing or would have had to undergo surgery anyway. He argued that, outside the emergency room, surgery is a choice. He explained that a person with a herniated disc faces a choice between spinal fusion or doing nothing, and choosing surgery does not negate the possibility that the accident contributed to the decision. He noted that Volk did have a choice, but his doctor recommended surgery. Specifically, Dr. Sun, on April 29, 2022, outlined options including continued surveillance, craniotomy, or radiation therapy, and ultimately recommended craniotomy.\n\n3) He challenged the claim that Volk would have necessarily had the meningioma removed eventually. He pointed out that his doctors offered continued surveillance as an option. He criticized a paragraph on Mount Sinai Hospital’s website that implies meningiomas must be removed, citing that the same site also states that if a tumor is growing slowly and does not affect health, it may be observed with regular MRI scans to monitor growth. In essence, he argued that the Mount Sinai source acknowledges that watching and waiting is an option, just as Volk’s doctors did.\n\nWhaley ended by presenting what he characterized as uncontroverted facts:\n- Prior to the accident, Volk did not have headaches or leg paresthesias.\n- After the accident, Volk developed persistent headaches that prompted a brain MRI.\n- The MRI revealed a small meningioma.\n- Volk’s neurologist and cancer doctor linked the headaches and paresthesias to the meningioma.\n- Volk’s neurologist recommended surgical removal of the meningioma, and Volk agreed to the procedure.\n- Volk underwent a craniotomy.\n\nWhaley framed two possible narratives to explain the relationship between the accident and the meningioma: either a conspicuous coincidence in which Volk had an asymptomatic meningioma that became symptomatic after the trauma and then required removal, or a causal relationship in which the trauma precipitated symptoms in an already asymptomatic meningioma, necessitating its removal.\n\nThe communication concluded with a courteous sign-off and best wishes.\n\nContext notes from the thread also reveal the chronological sequence of the prior exchanges, including the August 27, 2024 message from Whaley detailing the three-pronged argument above, followed by the September 5-6, 2024 exchanges in which the defense and plaintiff outlined their positions, medical references, and the proposed settlement terms. The core medical facts maintained throughout are that the accident occurred on September 24, 2021; Volk was asymptomatic before the accident; post-accident symptoms led to a brain MRI that found a small meningioma; the symptoms and tumor are linked by Volk’s treating physicians to the meningioma, with surgery ultimately chosen and performed; and there remains a dispute over causation and settlement, with the defense proposing a revised offer and the plaintiff maintaining that causation is supported by the medical record and the sequence of events.",

The email included a Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/ir12ytut3dnl9pxxpgp3c/AIOAM4OVk1o9oxetmvYO5jk?rlkey=zyaxlcf6o665ad8jt04mayar6&st=89svrdz8&dl=0. In addition, the message carried a standard confidentiality notice stating that the electronic communication is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient was instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm, refrain from using or distributing the information, and acknowledge that no privilege waiver applies.\n\nThis May 13 message followed an earlier email from March 18, 2025, at approximately 3:08 PM, from Dawn Suter, Legal Assistant to William B. Orberson and Allison Orberson-Wiles. In that message, counsel was advised that the following documents had been filed that day: an Answer; a Notice of Election of Electronic Service; and a Notice of Service of Discovery (Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents) along with a Word version and Authorizations. Dawn also asked that if discovery had been served previously in the matter, a Word copy be forwarded. Her signature block identified her as the Legal Assistant to William B. Orberson and Allison Orberson-Wiles, with direct line 502.560-9943, and provided the firm’s address at 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202; main phone 502.583.9900 and fax 502.587.1927; website w ppoalaw.com. The email carried the firm’s confidentiality notice, stating that the message was for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential and privileged information, and advised recipients to contact the sender to report an error and to destroy all copies if not the intended recipient.\n\nBoth emails were part of ongoing discovery communications in the Volk v. Safeco case, with the May 13 correspondence referencing Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses and a forthcoming set of authorizations, and the March 18 correspondence detailing the filed documents and a request to share Word copies of any previously served discovery.",
