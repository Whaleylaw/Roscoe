Tuttle along with colleagues Aaron Whaley and Justin Chumbley.\n\nThe timeline centers on the December 22, 2022 through January 4, 2023 communications. On December 22, 2022, Sarena Tuttle informed Muhammad that West Bend Mutual Insurance Company would provide bodily injury benefits for his claim and that the claim had been 100% accepted. She requested a complete list of medical providers Muhammad had seen for this accident, noting that he had visited a hospital in Tennessee and was currently receiving treatment with KORT Physical Therapy and seeing a neurologist. She asked for the specific names and addresses of the Tennessee hospital and the neurologist. She also acknowledged awareness of Muhammad’s December 9, 2022 incident and offered to help with that matter as well, asking him to forward any information related to that incident for a deeper review. She closed by inviting questions and providing her contact details.\n\nSubsequently, on January 4, 2023, the firm continued to press for documentation related to the December 9, 2022 accident. At 12:00 PM, Sarena wrote that she appreciated Muhammad updating his providers with her that afternoon and reiterated that they still needed the documents related to the December 9 incident, specifically the police report and any other claim information necessary to complete their investigation.\n\nLater that day, at 2:30 PM, Aaron Whaley replied that they had the information required to request a copy of the police report and stated that he had attached it. At 2:34 PM, Sarena responded that she had received something earlier that day and had spoken with him again moments earlier; she noted that Muhammad would be flying to Florida that night for a “special MRI to be included in both my accidents.” In the same thread, at 2:45 PM, Muhammad replied that he would like to have a copy of the police report and that he had sent a copy of the exchange of information.\n\nFinally, at 3:02 PM, Sarena confirmed that there were instructions to order the police report, that the firm would place the order, and that a copy would be forwarded to Muhammad upon receipt. The communications throughout this period reflect ongoing efforts to obtain the police report, secure documentation related to the December 9, 2022 accident, and coordinate medical and insurance related matters, including Muhammad’s stated travel to Florida for a special MRI to be included in both accidents. The Whaley Law Firm listed its contact information in the signatures of these communications.",

      "natural_language": "Muhammad Alif, represented by The Whaley Law Firm, is involved in two motor vehicle accidents: the first on November 8, 2022 and the second on December 9, 2022, the latter occurring in New York. The team has been coordinating police reports, medical information, and insurance benefits related to these incidents. In late December 2022, the firm noted that West Bend Mutual Insurance Company had accepted bodily injury benefits for the claim, and they requested a full list of medical providers Muhammad had seen for the accident, including a hospital in Tennessee, the Tennessee hospital and its address, the neurologist, and the multi-provider treatment history, while also acknowledging the December 9, 2022 incident and offering to assist with that matter as well. Ryan Gorelick indicated that the bodily injury claim was 100% accepted.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Sarena Tuttle emailed Muhammad to follow up after a detailed phone conversation. She attached the email from West Bend Mutual Insurance, confirming the accepted Bodily Injury benefits. She asked Muhammad to provide a complete list of medical providers seen for the accident, noting visits to a hospital in Tennessee, ongoing treatment with KORT Physical Therapy, and a neurologist, and she requested the specific names and addresses of the Tennessee hospital and the neurologist. She also indicated awareness of the December 9, 2022 incident and expressed willingness to help with that matter as well, asking Muhammad to forward any information he had related to that incident for a deeper review. The message closed with her standard contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS). The firm was also represented by Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40225; phone number 502-583-4022.\n\nBetween December 22 and January 4, 2023, communications continued to focus on gathering and submitting documentation to advance the investigation. On January 4, 2023, at 12:00 PM, Sarena wrote to Muhammad thanking him for updating his providers and reminding him that they still needed documents related to the December 9, 2022 accident. She requested that he forward the police report and any other claim information as soon as possible so the firm could complete its investigation.\n\nLater on January 4, 2023, at 2:30 PM, Aaron Whaley informed Sarena and Justin that they had the information necessary to request a copy of the police report and indicated that the related document was attached. At 2:34 PM, Sarena replied that she had received the material earlier that day and had spoken with him again a few minutes earlier; she noted that Muhammad was flying to Florida that evening for a \"special MRI to be included in both my accidents.\" \n\nAt 2:45 PM, Muhammad responded, requesting a copy of the police report and noting that he had just sent a copy of the exchange of information. Finally, at 3:02 PM, Sarena confirmed that there were instructions to order the police report and that they would order it and forward Muhammad a copy upon receipt. \n\nAt 8:33 PM (UTC) on January 4, 2023, Muhammad reiterated his request: regarding the New York accident, he needed the police report as soon as possible; he already had the report for the November 8 accident and needed the December 9 report specifically.\n\nContact details reflected in the communications include Sarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-12-09-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nIn a series of email exchanges from The Whaley Law Firm regarding Muhammad Alif’s motor vehicle accidents, the team worked to obtain police reports and medical claim information. The correspondence centers on two incidents: the accident on November 8, 2022, and the December 9, 2022 incident in New York, with ongoing efforts to obtain the related police report for the New York accident and to gather documentation for the December 9, 2022 claim.\n\nOn January 4, 2023 at 3:40 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm informed Mr. Alif that the New York police report was not available online and that a check would need to be sent to the NY Processing Center to obtain it. She noted that the request had been drafted and was awaiting a check to cover the processing and search fees; once the check was received, the request would be sent off. Her signature included the firm’s contact details and a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS,” with her new email address listed as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 3:33 PM, Muhammad Alif wrote that he needed the police report for the New York accident as soon as possible, clarifying that he already had the November 8 report and needed the December 9 report. He sent this message via Yahoo Mail for iPhone.\n\nAt 3:02 PM, Sarena replied: no problem, Mo. There are instructions included for ordering the police report, which they would initiate and forward to him a copy once received. Her message again included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and the new email address note.\n\nAt 2:45 PM, Muhammad Alif responded that he would like a copy of the police report and that he had already sent a copy of the exchange of information.\n\nAt 2:34 PM, Sarena wrote that she had received the material earlier that day and had spoken with him again a few minutes earlier. She noted that he was flying to Florida that night for a “special MRI to be included in both my accidents.”\n\nAt 2:30 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to Sarena and Justin, stating that they had the information necessary to request a copy of the report and that it had been attached.\n\nAt 12:00 PM, Sarena sent a message to Muhammad: good afternoon, Mo. She thanked him for updating his providers with her earlier that afternoon and stated that they still needed the documents related to the December 9, 2022 accident. She asked him to forward the police report and any other claim information as soon as possible so they could complete their investigation.\n\nOn December 22, 2022 at 12:41 PM, Sarena emailed again after speaking with Mr. Alif in more detail about his accident. She attached the email from West Bend Mutual Insurance Company indicating that bodily injury benefits would be provided in the claim, and, per Ryan Gorelick, the claim had been 100% accepted. She requested a complete list of medical providers Mr. Alif had seen for the December 9 accident and noted that he had visited a hospital in Tennessee and was currently receiving treatment at KORT Physical Therapy and seeing a neurologist. She asked for the specific names and addresses of the hospital in Tennessee and the neurologist. She added that they were also aware of the December 9, 2022 incident and were ready to help with that as well, asking Mr. Alif to forward any information related to that incident for deeper review. She closed by inviting him to contact the firm with any questions. The signature block again listed Sarena M. Tuttle and The Whaley Law Firm, along with the firm’s contact details and the note about the new email address.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the client’s focus remained on obtaining the December 9, 2022 New York police report and providing the necessary documentation to advance the investigation into both accidents, while the firm coordinated the steps to secure the reports and review the related medical and insurance information.",

She ended by thanking Aaron Whaley for his support and expressing that she is hurt and actions are needed immediately. The message was signed “Muhammand Alif.”\n\nLater that same day, at 12:39:54 p.m., Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded to Nona Bacote. She thanked Nona for the detailed email and confirmed that the firm would handle obtaining all required documentation; there is nothing Nona needed to do beyond focusing on getting better. She stated that they had already requested the New York Police Report and had set up the claims for Muhammad’s first accident. The firm’s Medical Records Clerk would work on obtaining Muhammad’s medical records, and Nona should keep them posted if Muhammad treats with any new providers not already listed in the email. Regarding travel to appointments, Sarena asked for receipts to verify those expenses and reminded that Kentucky has a travel reimbursement statute that will determine the reimbursable amount. She invited any questions and provided her contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial (502) 357-9971; office (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address).",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-12-09-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This note summarizes the January 2023 email correspondence regarding Muhammad Alif (Mr. Alif) and PIP coverage for two motor vehicle incidents.\n\nOn January 23, 2023, at 8:22 AM, Brittany Clark, Call Center Manager at Aptiva Health, sent an email to Ms. Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm. In her message, Brittany stated that Mr. Alif had been scheduled for treatment in Aptiva Health that day and indicated that the treatment related to an auto accident. He had listed Sarena as his representation for an auto accident that occurred on November 8, 2022, and Brittany requested confirmation of whether PIP coverage is available. Brittany’s signature block provided her title, contact numbers, email (bclark@aptivahealth.com), website (aptivahealth.com), and the Aptiva Health address (3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218), along with a standard confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 11:28:54 AM the same day, Monday, January 23, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle replied to Brittany with reconfirmation that PIP coverage is available for both of Mr. Alif’s incidents. She provided the following insurer details: for MVA on 11/08/2022, Farmers Insurance, contact Michael Santos, phone (248) 488-2779, email MyClaim@FarmersInsurance.com, Claim number 7005284778-1-2; and for MVA on 12/10/2022, American Transit Insurance, contact Chevan Douglas, phone (212) 857-8200 Ext 1624, Claim number 1123215. In her closing, she included her own contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (D) (502) 357-9971; office line (O) (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as the new email address. The email was also cc’d to Shanta Harper (sharper@aptivahealth.com) and carried the subject Re: Muhammad Alif. The message included the standard confidentiality notice typical of firm correspondence.\n\nIn summary, the thread establishes that there is PIP coverage available for both of Mr. Alif’s auto accident incidents (11/08/2022 and 12/10/2022), and it provides the specific insurer contacts, claim numbers, and the updated contact email for Sarena Tuttle, along with the relevant parties copied on the communications.",

The email states that Sarena received a voicemail today on Kendra Fogle, who is described as Mo’s New York companion. In her message, Sarena questions why Kendra and the client are traveling all over the United States for basic treatment that she believes is available in Kentucky, and she warns that this travel could become an issue at settlement. She also contends that Mo believes he will receive over a million dollars, which she says is not the case, regardless of how much he is racking up in billing for injuries.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-12-09-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif, whose December 9, 2022 motor vehicle accident occurred in New York. The file records a sequence of correspondence involving Alif and The Whaley Law Firm, with Nona Bacote also copied on one message, regarding insurance coverage, progress with a Progressive claim, and related medical imaging and police documentation.\n\nThe first dated item in the Re: Car Accident thread shows an email from Muhammad Alif (stimulus110@yahoo.com) to Serena Tuttle and Aaron Whaley, with Nona Bacote CC’d, sent on January 31, 2023 at 19:33:31 UTC. In that message, he states that he has located a Progressive claim number related to his New York automobile accident. He notes the date of the accident as December 9, 2022, and identifies the vehicle as registered to Mejia Jose. He reports speaking with someone named Virgil at Progressive, who advised that a claim has been filed in New York. He asks the recipients to be aware of the claim number 228451213 and provides the adjuster’s name as Eric Kastar, with a contact phone number of 631-319-4532.\n\nEarlier communications in the chain shed more detail. On January 26, 2023, at 7:18 PM, Nona Bacote wrote to Sarena, relaying that Muhammad Alif had been seen at Envision Imaging that week, located at 12201 Merit Drive, Suite 100, Dallas, Texas 75251. The office there can be reached at (214) 276-0050, with a fax number of (214) 276-0057, and the imaging facility’s website listed as http://www.envivionimg.com. The message notes that an MRI had been ordered but services were refused due to the client’s claustrophobia. Nona also mentions that Muhammad had obtained the police report for the New York accident and asks whether Progressive Insurance has been identified as the insurer.\n\nThe next day, January 27, 2023, at 9:28 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Mo (Muhammad) asking him to forward the police report, indicating ongoing coordination. At 9:54 AM, Sarena added that Progressive had been contacted and that they do not insure the defendant in the second accident; she explained that the cab company carries a policy of $25,000/$50,000. She noted that because the cab was not the at-fault driver, the cab company has the right to deny all liability, accept 50% liability, or accept 100% liability, and if they accept 100% liability, the maximum recoverable would be $25,000. She also inquired whether Muhammad had under-insured motorist coverage on his personal policy.\n\nLater, at 10:56 AM on January 27, Sarena sent another update: “I have his copy of the PR. Star faxed it over.” The message confirms that the police report copy had been obtained and shared.\n\nIn the same week, Muhammad sent another note on January 27, 2023, at 1:51 PM, stating, “Good afternoon after reviewing my policy it’s been discovered I only had $25,000 on a sewer motors.” This line appears to reflect his understanding of the available limits, though it reads with a likely misprint.\n\nTogether, the notes depict an ongoing effort to confirm the insurance coverage for the New York accident (the Progressive claim 228451213 with adjuster Eric Kastar), the involvement of a cab company with a $25k/$50k policy in the second incident, the status of Progressive’s coverage for the defendant in the second accident, and the procurement of the New York police report and medical imaging information (Envision Imaging in Dallas) tied to Muhammad Alif’s case. The communications also show the client’s pursuit of clarity on insurer identification and available coverage, as well as updates regarding the medical imaging decision due to claustrophobia.",

He noted that they were already at the airport, and after the police report was written, he told the officer that he would go to the hospital once his plane landed in Louisville, Kentucky.

      "natural_language": "Case Muhammad-Alif-MVA-12-09-2022 involves client Muhammad Alif. On February 6, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Nona Bacote regarding the accidents and the medical records. In that message, Sarena stated that all of the client’s providers have been documented and that this has been confirmed multiple times. She noted that all records and bills have been requested and that the firm is awaiting receipt of those records and bills, with providers given a minimum of 30 days to produce the documents. The client had requested policy limits and PIP to be released to Starlite. Sarena explained that, as she had advised before, insurance companies are not required to disclose policy limits prior to a demand being submitted. A demand cannot be submitted until all medical bills and records are received, which again have been requested. She also explained to both the client and Gail that Aaron typically waits for the medical bills for review before releasing PIP payments, since he must determine who receives what portion of the available benefits and cannot simply release all benefits to a single provider when there are numerous providers and already about $30,000 between two of them. Sarena stated she had sent this information to Aaron to review, along with the note that a civil suit is being “following” or “filed” on the client’s behalf. She concluded that Aaron would reach out to discuss the matter further. The email included Sarena’s signature and contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct line: (502) 357-9971; Office line: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.” The message was addressed to Nona Bacote (nibacote40@verizon.net) and CC’d Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) and Muhammad Alif (stimulus110@yahoo.com). The email header shows it was sent Monday, February 6, 2023, at 12:14:37 p.m. to the recipients.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 11:54 a.m., Nona Bacote had written back to Serena to clarify her medical treatment in relation to the two accidents in which she was involved. She indicated that on November 8, 2023 she was involved in her first accident and received treatment at Parkridge Medical Center, and she received additional medical care from Norton Health Care, Cutting Edge, Anointed Hands, Mark Lynn, and Kort Physical Therapy, listed in that order. She noted that all imaging had been performed at Innovative Open MRI & Imaging Diagnostic Imaging Center in Lake Mary, Florida, and that she had also received a consultation at Aptiv. She stated that on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, she would be going to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, New York for further medical treatment. She identified Farmers Insurance as the insurance company for this accident only and requested that all bills from the above treatment centers be sent to Farmers for payment. She also stated that she was requesting policy limits immediately from Farmers. She further indicated that on December 9, 2023 she was involved in her second accident in New York, in which she was a passenger in a cab that was rear-ended by another automobile. She noted that she had only been seen by Cutting Edge and Starlite Chiropractor for medical treatment in relation to this accident and that she had uninsured motorist insurance. She concluded by acknowledging that this was a lot to process and asked that if it was too much for the recipient, they should let her know as soon as possible. The message ended with the name “Muhamad Alif.”",

The subject was the Release of PIP benefits, and the message outlined the need to specify which PIP release was desired and to whom the funds should be released.\n\nSarena explained that she had discussed the claims with Aaron, who approved releasing PIP but required clarification on which PIP to release and the recipient(s). The options were to release the PIP from the 11/08 accident, the PIP from the 12/09 accident, or both. She asked for specific instructions on which providers should receive the funds. If a PIP payment is to go to a provider that rendered services for both accidents, such as Cutting Edge, she asked for a further specification of which billing would be paid.\n\nShe noted that two providers are currently seeking payment: Starlite Chiro and Cutting Edge Medical Services. Gail from Starlite Chiro advised that the client’s billing is over $10,000.00, though she is awaiting toner to print a billing statement. Cutting Edge Medical Services’ bill is referenced as “see attached.” At the time of the email, these providers were claiming over $30,000.00 in medicals to date.

The client is Muhammad Alif.\n\nOn March 13, 2023, the EUO matter for Muhammad Alif (EUO #1123215-01) was the subject of an external email with the header Re: [EXTERNAL] Muhammad Alif EUO #1123215-01. The note shows the case as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-12-09-2022 and indicates the client is Muhammad Alif. The initial line in the note reads simply “No.”, after which the email thread is presented.\n\nAt 1:51 PM on March 13, 2023, Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, sent an email to Haylei M. Spencer (HSpencer@american-transit.com) and to Muhammad Alif at muhammadalifmvaz3105436@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, with the subject “[EXTERNAL] Muhammad Alif EUO #1123215-01.” In his message, Whaley wrote: “Haylei, I hope this email finds you well. I am confirming tomorrow's EUO of Muhammad Alif. Please forward the zoom information. Thank you.” The email included Whaley’s signature block, listing the Whaley Law Firm address at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and the phone number 502-583-4022. It also contained a confidentiality notice stating that the email and attachments are for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information, and that any unauthorized review, use, disclosure, or distribution is prohibited; if not the intended recipient, the recipient should contact the sender by reply email and destroy all copies of the email and its attachments. The firm’s contact information appears again under the closing, including the address and phone number.\n\nLater in the thread, at approximately 1:57 PM, Haylei Spencer-Roach of the No Fault Legal Department replied: “Noted. Zoom confirmed – will your client need an interpreter?” Her message also included the No Fault Legal Department’s policy note: “Company Policy regarding Examination Under Oath: As indicated on the EUO notice, we request a forty eight (48) business hours prior to confirmation.” She signed the message as Haylei Spencer-Roach, No Fault Legal Department, with the EUOScheduling email address EUOScheduling@american-transit.com and the contact number 212-857-8200 EXT 1625. An image (cid:image001.png@01D48D6C.A564D460) accompanied the signature.\n\nIn summary, the exchange centers on coordinating Muhammad Alif’s EUO for the December 10, 2022 motor vehicle accident (MVA), with Whaley requesting tomorrow’s EUO Zoom details, and Spencer confirming Zoom and noting interpreter considerations and the company’s 48-business-hour confirmation policy.",
