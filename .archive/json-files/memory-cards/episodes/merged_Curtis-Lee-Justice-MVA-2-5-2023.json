      "natural_language": "Case: Curtis-Lee-Justice-MVA-2-5-2023. Client: Curtis Lee Justice.\n\nIn early June 2023, correspondence related to Curtis Justice’s motor vehicle accident claim was circulated between the Whaley Law Firm and Clearcover. The matter is associated with Clearcover claim number 23ATKY338083287 and policy KY165502, with the date of loss reported as February 5, 2023. The subject line referenced was “Re: FW: Clearcover 23ATKY338083287, CURTIS JUSTICE.” Justin Chumbley of Whaley Law Firm reassigned the file, and Coleen Thea Ferry Madayag of Whaley Law Firm acknowledged the reassignment with the note, “This is noted.”\n\nOn June 1, 2023, Clearcover’s claims representative, Yaneth Hernandez, wrote to Justin’s firm and introduced herself as the handler for Curtis Justice’s claim, indicating she would work to resolve it promptly. She asked to know whether the office would be representing Mr. Justice for property damage or if discussions could proceed directly with him. Hernandez noted that Mr. Justice had planned to send photos for the vehicle estimate during a phone call on March 27, but those photos had not yet been received. The email listed the following claim details: Policy Number KY165502; Your Claim Number 23ATKY338083287; Date of Loss February 5, 2023; Hernandez’s phone number 312-235-1048. She also referenced claimsteam@claims.clearcover.com and included a message from Clearcover to Whaley Law Firm.\n\nHernandez stated that Clearcover had received a letter of representation dated March 30, 2023, and outlined the information needed to properly evaluate the claim. The email indicated that attachments included CMS, HIPAA, and a Medical Provider List, and requested that Mr. Justice complete these forms and return them as soon as possible. For evaluation purposes, Clearcover requested the following documentation: all medical records relating to treatment since the accident; if any pre-existing conditions relate to injuries sustained in the loss, prior records will be required; and if Mr. Justice claims any wage loss resulting from the accident, proper supporting documentation is required. The message concluded with appreciation for anticipated cooperation, and provided contact details: claims@clearcover.com and 312-235-1048.",

Beginning in mid-June 2023, the Whaley Law Firm, through attorney Coleen Thea Ferry Madayag, initiated a series of inquiries to obtain two key items from the PIP insurer regarding their client: an acknowledgment of receipt of the letter of representation and an updated PIP ledger for Curtis Justice.\n\nOn June 15, 2023, Coleen Madayag sent an email to 6158466265@rcfax.com requesting acknowledgment of receipt for their letter of representation and asking for an updated Personal Injury Protection (PIP) ledger for Curtis Justice.

The email was addressed to Coleen and to Torian Leach at 6158466265@rcfax.com, reiterating the request for the acknowledgment and the ledger.\n\nOn July 13, 2023, Coleen sent another external email reiterating the request for acknowledgement of the letter of representation and the updated PIP ledger for their client Curtis Justice. That message included a caution note stating: “CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.” The message was directed to Torian Leach and 6158466265@rcfax.com.\n\nFollowing these inquiries, a forwarded thread on July 28, 2023 shows that Torian Leach acknowledged that the ack letter had been sent by the PIP adjuster on July 10, 2023. The adjuster was identified as Stacey Giehl, with Trexis Insurance, and contact information provided: phone 615.312.2322 and email stacey.giehl@trexis.com. Torian Leach noted that he had attached the letter Stacey Giehl submitted for the case. The original emails within the thread include the June 15 and June 21 messages from Coleen Madayag, as well as the July 13 external email referencing the same requests for acknowledgment and the updated PIP ledger.

      "natural_language": "Case: Curtis-Lee-Justice-MVA-2-5-2023. Client: Curtis Lee Justice.\n\nIn the Curtis Lee Justice motor vehicle accident matter, a sequence of email exchanges occurred between the Whaley Law Firm and Trexis Insurance regarding the file reference 755905. On June 15, 2023, Coleen Thea Ferry Madayag of the Whaley Law Firm sent a message with the subject 755905 to the fax address 6158466265@rcfax.com. She requested Trexis acknowledge receipt of the law firm’s letter of representation and to forward an updated PIP ledger for their client, Curtis Justice. The body of that message included a confidentiality notice stating that the information was confidential and intended only for the named recipient, with instructions to contact the sender and destroy copies if the reader was not the intended recipient; it also contained a disclaimer about virus responsibility and Trexis Insurance’s lack of liability for any loss or damage arising from its use.\n\nOn June 21, 2023, at 3:41 PM, Coleen again wrote to Ms. Torian, explaining that she hoped the email found her well and reiterating the request to acknowledge the letter of representation and to send the updated PIP ledger for Curtis Justice. The message concluded with Coleen’s standard contact information: Whaley Law Firm, phone 502-450-9495, fax 502-364-9363, coleen@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nThe thread continued on July 13, 2023, at 11:06 AM, when Coleen sent another external message to Torian Leach (and to 6158466265@rcfax.com) with the subject Re: 755905. The message stated, “Hi Ms. Torian, I hope this email finds you well. This is Coleen from the Whaley Law Firm. Just following up on an acknowledgement for our letter of rep and please send us the updated PIP ledger for our client, Curtis Justice. Thank you.” Coleen’s signature and contact information followed.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on June 15, 2023, Coleen had sent the original request to acknowledge receipt and to forward an updated PIP ledger for Curtis Justice, as noted in the forwarded message visible in the chain.\n\nOn July 28, 2023, at approximately 9:00 AM, Torian Leach replied to the thread, noting that the acknowledgment letter had been sent out by the PIP adjuster back on 7/10/2023. The adjuster was identified as Stacey Giehl, with contact details: 615.312.2322 and stacey.giehl@trexis.com. Torian added that she had attached the letter Stacey submitted in the case.\n\nLater that same day, at 9:27:56 AM, Coleen Madayag replied: “Received.

      "natural_language": "Case: Curtis-Lee-Justice-MVA-2-5-2023. Client: Curtis Lee Justice.\n\nRe: CURTIS JUSTICE TREXIS PIP 755905.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, at 11:08:59 -0400, Coleen Thea Ferry Madayag of Whaley Law Firm (coleen@whaleylawfirm.com) sent an email to Stacey Giehl at Trexis Insurance (Stacey.Giehl@trexis.com) regarding the client's PIP application. The note states that this is acknowledged and that the firm is still working on the PIP submission. They are currently confirming some information with their client to ensure everything is correct and will send the application as soon as it is completed. The message ends with: “Thank you for your understanding.” Coleen Madayag signed the email, identifying Whaley Law Firm with phone number (502) 450-9495, fax number (502) 364-9363, and the email address coleen@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, July 31, 2023, at approximately 10:24 AM, Stacey Giehl, First Party Medical Claims Adjuster for Trexis and Trexis One Insurance, responded: “Hello, What is the status of your client’s PIP application? Thank you.” The email included a Treatment Log for the insured party, Curtis Justice, who is associated with Whaley Law Firm located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. The log lists the deductible as $0.00 and the policy limit as $10,000.00, with Trexis Insurance Corp identified as the company. The provider field is blank in the log.\n\nTwo medical claims are itemized in the Treatment Log. The first entry is for an ER physician labeled “SE ER PHYS,” with a Date(s) of Service listed as 03/13/2023, and a service window from 02/05/2023 to 02/05/2023. The billed amount is $993.00, with Date PD noted as 01/01/0001, and both $Paid and Amt Ptd recorded as $0.00. The status column shows WOPA. The second entry is for St. Joseph, with a Date(s) of Service listed as 06/26/2023, and a service window from 02/05/2023 to 02/05/2023. The billed amount is $1,751.00, Date PD is 01/01/0001, and both $Paid and Amt Ptd are $0.00. The status column again shows WOPA, and the Deductible column is not filled in for either entry.\n\nIn total, the log shows Billed to date of $2,744.00 and Paid to date of $0.00. The log also reiterates Stacey Giehl’s role as First Party Medical Claims Adjuster for Trexis and Trexis One Insurance, with office phone (615) 312-2322, fax (615) 661-4838, and email Stacey.Giehl@trexis.com; website www.trexis.com.\n\nThe email correspondence includes a confidentiality notice stating that the information is confidential and intended only for the named recipient. If the reader is not the intended recipient, distribution or use is strictly prohibited; if received in error, the reader should contact the sender by the provided phone number or email address and destroy all copies of the original message.

      "natural_language": "In the Curtis Lee Justice motor vehicle accident case (MVA) dated 2-5-2023, an issue arose around a RESCAN of billing records. The Whaley Law Firm, through attorney Jessica, initiated a request to obtain the client’s billing invoices. On June 7, 2023, a RESCAN request was sent from smartrequest@cioxhealth.com to the escalation system (srescalations) on behalf of Jessica. The message logged the following details: Date of request 6/6/2023; Customer Number 2254128; Invoice Number/E-request ID 149009539; Name of Contact Jessica; Contact Info 502-583-4022; Email jessica@whaleylawfirm.com. The chat details note: Request ID 149009539 – we received medical records but also need billing. If you could send that to rescan that’d be great! Employee Initials: S.T. The message also indicates it was sent through Ciox Health’s Smart Request system and, in line with the footer, carried the note that “This message was secured by Zix.”\n\nThe following day, June 8, 2023 at 8:11 AM, SREscalations replied to Jessica. In a message titled RE:418005338, Jasmine S apologized that not all items had been released as originally requested. She stated that she had submitted a rescan for the missing bills and asked Jessica to allow 7 to 10 days for completion.\n\nNearly a month later, on August 7, 2023 at 10:54:55 AM, Jessica again contacted SREscalations with the subject RE: RESCAN. She reported that they had never received the bills as requested and urged that they be sent as soon as possible. This August 7 email was sent from The Whaley Law Firm to SREscalations, with the Request ID 149009539 noted in the header, and cc’d CurtisLeeJusticeMVAZ3541225@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.
