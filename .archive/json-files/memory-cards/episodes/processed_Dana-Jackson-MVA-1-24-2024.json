      "natural_language": "This narrative covers the Dana Jackson case (Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024), involving client Dana Jackson in a motor vehicle accident claim, with communications focused on PIP (Personal Injury Protection) benefits and the associated police report.\n\nIn February 2024, communications began with an email dated February 9, 2024. Aries Paul Pe\u00f1aflor of Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Ashley Joyner with the subject 01007187244, stating that an attached file should be reviewed. The email included a confidentiality notice and listed multiple insurance entities: Permanent General Assurance Corporation; Permanent General Assurance Corporation of Ohio; The General Automobile Insurance Company, Inc.; Old American County Mutual Fire Insurance Company (TX only); and Homesite Insurance Company of Georgia (GA only). The message was signed with \u201cAll the best, Aries Paul Pe\u00f1aflor, Whaley Law Firm\u201d and provided the firm\u2019s contact details.\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Dana Cohen, a desk adjuster with MedPIP Operations at The General Insurance (an AmFam Group Company), replied to Aries. At 4:01 PM, Cohen wrote: Good Afternoon, in order for us to move forward with PIP we need the police report. Do you have a copy? Thank you. Thereafter, Aries confirmed that the police report was attached. Cohen\u2019s message and Aries\u2019s confirmation of the attached police report appear in the same email thread, which also included the standard sign-off for Dana Cohen and the General Insurance contact information. The February 13 exchange is part of the ongoing process to obtain the police report necessary to advance PIP processing.\n\nBy early March 2024, the correspondence shifted to the status of PIP payouts. On March 7, 2024 at 11:05 AM, Dana-Morae Cohen, Desk Adjuster MedPIP Operations, sent a reply noting updated PIP logs for the clients. She stated that $6,665.00 had been paid out for Cecil and $5,735 had been paid out for Dana, and she asked for guidance on how to proceed with their PIP benefits. This message was part of the internal update to the case\u2019s PIP status.\n\nThat same day, March 7, 2024, a forward of Cohen\u2019s update was sent to the Filevine project email addresses associated with Cecil Finley and Dana Jackson. The forward carried the subject line \u201cRe: 01007187244\u201d and displayed the original message from Cohen detailing the PIP payout amounts described above. The forwarded message was dated at 13:31:33 -0500 and was addressed to Cecil Finley\u2019s Filevine project email and Dana Jackson\u2019s Filevine project email, ensuring both parties were informed of the updated PIP status.\n\nIn summary, the case\u2019s key chronological elements include the February 9, 2024 initial attachment from Whaley Law Firm concerning claim 01007187244; the February 13, 2024 exchange in which the police report was requested and then confirmed as attached; and the March 7, 2024 update from Dana Cohen detailing PIP payouts ($6,665.00 for Cecil, $5,735 for Dana) and seeking direction on next steps, followed by the March 7 forwarding of that update to the relevant Filevine recipients.",

      "natural_language": "In the case file Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024, involving client Dana Jackson, the Whaley Law Firm correspondence was sent on Friday, January 10, 2025 at 10:42:51 AM Eastern Time. The email, titled \u201cRe: Dana Jackson Certified Medical Billing Error,\u201d was from Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, to Starlite Chiropractic with copies to Starlite Chiropractic at lgsweasy@gmail.com and to Bryce Koon at bryce@whaleylawfirm.com. The message notes that on December 19 a request was made for clarification on the certified medical billing related to Dana Jackson, and, to date, there has been no response.\n\nThe primary concern raised is a discrepancy between the pre-litigation billing and the certified billing. Specifically, the Pre-Lit Billing shows $6,770.00, while the certified billing shows only $1,725.00. The email states that this discrepancy needs to be addressed because the case is in the discovery phase of litigation and Mr. Jackson\u2019s responses are approaching overdue status. If clarification is not provided soon, the firm asserts they will be limited to claiming only $1,725.00 for Starlite\u2019s facility, which would hurt Mr. Jackson\u2019s settlement and also means Starlite will not receive full consideration for payment. The email requests immediate contact to discuss the matter in further detail.\n\nThe message also references a prior email from December 19, 2024, sent by Sarena Tuttle at approximately 1:55 PM, which stated: \u201cThank you so much for the corrected Certification Page. Unfortunately, when I went to note the Bills, I noticed the Certified Billing only shows $1,725.00 in Charges while the Uncertified Billing shows $6,770.00. In addition the $1,725.00 bill shows $1,100.00 in payments but no adjustment to the balance, please clarify.\u201d This earlier communication is included with the same sign-off and contact details.\n\nThe email is signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.

The packet contained twenty items, which included the following: 1) Any and all employers at the time of the incident and/or after; 2) Skip\u2014Irrelevant; 3) List any persons other than Cecil and the Defendant who may have witnessed the incident; 4) Describe how the accident took place in Dana\u2019s own words; 5) Skip\u2014Premature Disclosure; 6) Skip\u2014Premature Disclosure; 7) Skip\u2014Bryce will compile & answer; 8) Describe Dana\u2019s injuries in her own words; 9) List any prior significant injuries/illnesses (e.g., broken bones, pulled muscles, surgeries, etc.); 10) List any subsequent significant injuries/illnesses; 11) Have you had any prior accidents, yes or no, and if yes, please list; 12) Skip\u2014Duplicative to 11; 13) Ensure we have a list of medical providers including your Primary Care Physician related to your accident; 14) List any medical providers for any prior injuries or surgeries; 15) Skip\u2014Duplicative to 4; 16) Were you wearing your seatbelt? Yes or No; 17) Skip\u2014Irrelevant, you were not the driver; 18) Do you have any photographs related to the incident or your injuries?; 19) Do you have private health insurance? If so, please send us a copy of your card; 20) Have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes or No, and if Yes, please provide the year, charge, and case outcome.\n\nThe sender instructed Dana to answer these questions to the best of her recollection, with the stated due back date of January 10, 2025.\n\nSubsequently, on January 13, 2025, at 3:03 PM Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle again sent Dana a similar notice from the same Defense Counsel packet. This second message was addressed to BXFinest83@gmail.com, again requesting Dana review the attached discovery request packet and provide answers to the same twenty questions by the same recall standard, with the same twenty items and the same \u201cSkip\u201d designations and notes (e.g., Bryce will compile & answer, duplicative items, etc.). The January 13 message again included Sarena Tuttle\u2019s signature and contact information, including the note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nIn both messages, the content of the twenty-item list remained consistent. The items included requests to identify current and past employers, identify witnesses beyond Cecil and the Defendant, recount the accident in Dana\u2019s own words, describe injuries and prior or subsequent injuries, list prior accidents, compile medical provider information (including the primary care physician related to the accident and providers for prior injuries), confirm whether Dana wore a seatbelt, confirm if she has any photographs of the incident or injuries, determine private health insurance status (and provide a card if applicable), and disclose felony convictions with year, charge, and case outcome if applicable. The messages repeatedly noted that Bryce would compile and answer item 7 and labeled several items as duplicative or irrelevant (e.g., items 2, 5, 6, 12, 15, 17).\n\nSignature blocks in both messages identified Sarena M. Tuttle as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the same firm address and contact numbers: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and the explicit note: (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024. Client: Dana Jackson.\n\nThe Defense Counsel\u2019s Discovery Request for Dana Jackson\u2019s motor vehicle accident claim carried a due date of January 10, 2025. The matter includes an email chain in which the discovery request was first sent to Dana on December 20, 2024. In that forward, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm addressed Dana at jacksondana950@gmail.com with the subject The Defense Counsel\u2019s Discovery Request - Due back by January 10, 2025 and asked Dana to review the attached discovery request packet and answer the following questions to the best of her recollection. Bryce Koon was cc\u2019d on the email. The attached packet contained twenty questions, with instructions indicating that some items were to be skipped as Irrelevant or Duplicative, and others were designated for Bryce to compile. The questions covered topics such as employment at the time of the incident, witnesses other than Cecil and the Defendant, a narrative description of how the accident occurred, injuries, prior and subsequent injuries, prior accidents, medical providers related to the accident, seatbelt use, photographs, private health insurance, and felony convictions. Specific responses and placeholders in the December 20, 2024 initial request mirrored the enumerated twenty questions present in the correspondence. The message concluded with the standard signature block for Sarena M. Tuttle, including her title (Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager), firm (The Whaley Law Firm), address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), and contact information (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note indicating the email address is current).\n\nThe defense follow-up and Dana\u2019s responses were carried forward in January 2025. On January 13, 2025, Dana replied, stating that she had answered the questions below and that the answers were included in bold, and she invited any further requests. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle circulated the responses to the Discovery Request as follows:\n\n1) Any & All Employers at the time of the incident and/or after: None.\n2) Skip - Irrelevant.\n3) List any persons other than Cecil and the Defendant that may have witnessed the incident: None.\n4) Describe how the accident took place in your own words: \u201cwe were driving the other driver backed out the driveway into the highway and hit us.\u201d\n5) Skip - Premature Disclosure.\n6) Skip - Premature Disclosure.\n7) Skip - Bryce will compile & answer.\n8) Describe your injuries in your own words: \u201churt my neck, lower and upper back, right hip and arm.\u201d\n9) List any prior significant injuries/illnesses (ex. broken bones, pulled muscles, surgeries, etc): None.\n10) List any subsequent significant injuries/illnesses: badly bruised.\n11) Have you had any prior accidents, yes or no, if yes, please list: No.\n12) Skip - Duplicative to 11.\n13) Make sure we have a list of your medical providers including your Primary Care Physician related to your accident: (no specific list provided in the response).\n14) List any medical providers for any prior injuries, surgeries: (no specific list provided in the response).\n15) Skip - Duplicative to 4.\n16) Were you wearing your seatbelt?

If so, please send us a copy of your card: No.\n20) Have you ever been convicted of a Felony? Yes or No, If Yes, please provide the Year, Charge, Case Outcome: (no answer provided in the record).\n\nThe signature block for Sarena M. Tuttle followed, listing her position, firm, and contact information, including the address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and email (E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), with a note confirming the email address as current.\n\nFor context, the chain shows the initial forward on December 20, 2024, introducing the same discovery request packet and questions, sent to Dana Jackson at jacksondana950@gmail.com and cc\u2019d to Bryce Koon, with Sarena reiterating the request and the same twenty questions. The subject line in that forward was The Defense Counsel\u2019s Discovery Request - Due back by January 10, 2025. The forwarding email was followed by Dana\u2019s January 13, 2025 response, and Gerold Reynolds later acknowledged with a note that he had answered the questions below and that the items were in bold, requesting to know if anything else was needed. The attorney contact details and firm information are reiterated in both the forward and the subsequent messages.",

      "natural_language": "This file concerns Dana Jackson in the motor vehicle accident matter Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler, Jefferson Circuit Court case number 24-CI-005774. The client identified in the file is Dana Jackson. The communication thread originates from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with the subject line referencing Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler, and it shows a distribution list that includes Debora(h) Dilbeck of Dilbeck & Myers as the recipient, with copies to Cecil Finley, Dana Jackson, and Sarena Tuttle. The message chain is dated starting in December 2024 and continues through February 2025.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, at approximately 11:43 AM (the record shows 11:43?AM), Bryce Koon wrote to counsel regarding discovery responses. He indicated that the opposing party had filed responses to the requests for admission but that the remaining discovery responses had not yet been received, and he requested an update on when those responses would be provided. His message included his firm\u2019s signature block, which listed The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number and fax number, and it carried the standard attorney\u2011client privileged disclaimer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and outlining steps if received in error.\n\nOn January 22, 2025, at about 3:32 PM (time shown as 3:32?PM in the record), Bryce Koon followed up again. He wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this one again \u2013 please advise when we may expect your client\u2019s responses in this regard.\u201d He again provided his contact information and the firm\u2019s disclaimer, and he reiterated the need for a response.\n\nFinally, on February 17, 2025, at 01:07:27 GMT-05:00, Bryce Koon sent a further follow-up message. He stated: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Following up again on the outstanding requests. Please advise when we may expect responses. If I do not hear back from you in this regard, I will be forced to file a motion to compel.\u201d This message again included the Whaley Law Firm signature block and the standard privilege/disclaimer language.\n\nAcross all three emails, the subject centered on outstanding discovery requests in the above case, with an explicit note that responses to requests for admission had been filed, but other discovery responses were still outstanding. The communications were directed to counsel for the opposing party and included copies to Dana Jackson and others involved in the matter, and every message concluded with the firm\u2019s confidentiality and privilege disclaimer.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024\nClient: Dana Jackson\n\nIn the matter of Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson 24-CI-005774), relating to client Dana Jackson, the following email communications occurred between counsel starting in December 2024 and continuing through February 2025. The initial outreach was on December 27, 2024, when W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Deborah Campbell Myers, Esq., of Dilbeck & Myers PLLC, with copies to Cecil Finley (the Filevine project email address), Dana Jackson (the Filevine project email address), Sarena Tuttle, and the Dilbeck & Myers attorneys. In that message, Koon stated that he had reviewed the discovery with his opposing counsel and that while the responses to the requests for admission had been filed, the remaining discovery responses had not yet been provided. He requested an update and warned that if no update was received, he would pursue a motion to compel.\n\nOn January 22, 2025, there were additional follow-up messages. In the first Jan. 22 note, Bryce Koon again asked for guidance on when the opposing party\u2019s client responses could be expected. The communication included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer typical of these exchanges, noting that the message was intended only for the named recipient and that disclosure or distribution should not occur if the message was received in error.\n\nLater on January 22, 2025, another message from Koon reiterated the request for the other party\u2019s client responses and again carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nBy February 17, 2025, the exchange continued with another follow-up from Koon. He stated that he wished to know when he could expect the outstanding discovery responses and again warned that, if no response was received, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. This message also carried the same confidentiality language as prior emails.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Deborah Myers, replying at 1:22 p.m. in the same thread, apologized for the delayed reply. She explained that she had reviewed the discovery with Mr. Kiebler and was working on the responses, but she was currently in a short trial that week and would be out of the office the following week, which would slow her ability to provide the responses for final review and signature. She requested the courtesy of an additional three weeks. In her message, Myers reiterated her contact details and reminded the recipients of the confidentiality and privilege protections. The thread included multiple CCs and the same set of recipients as prior messages, and the exchanges continued to include the standard attorney-client privilege notices.\n\nAcross these communications, the parties remained focused on producing the outstanding discovery responses for the Finley & Jackson v. Kiebler case, with Dana Jackson as the client and the matter proceeding in Jefferson County under the case number 24-CI-005774.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns the matter Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024, involving client Dana Jackson in Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson County, case number 24-CI-005774). The file identifies the client as Dana Jackson and references the underlying case Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler.\n\nThe communications documented are email exchanges from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, regarding outstanding discovery requests in the Jefferson County matter. The most recent message in the thread (from Bryce Koon) was addressed to Deborah at dilbeckandmyers.com and CC\u2019d Cecil Finley ( Filevine project email CecilFinleyMVAZ4453250@ louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com ), Dana Jackson ( DanaJacksonMVAZ4453875@ louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com ), and Sarena Tuttle ( DanaJacksonMVAZ4453875@ louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The message states: \u201cp again on the outstanding requests. Please advise when we may expect responses. If I do not hear back from you in this regard, I will be forced to file a motion to compel.\u201d It is signed by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number (502) 365-5043 and fax number (502) 237-3207. The email includes the standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and outlining that any inadvertent receipt should not waive privilege and should be reported to The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nWithin the chain, there are two earlier dated follow-ups from Bryce Koon. On Wednesday, January 22, 2025, at about 3:32 PM, Koon wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this one again - please advise when we may expect your client's responses in this regard.\u201d He again identifies himself and his firm with the same contact details and includes the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAn earlier message, dated Friday, December 27, 2024, at 11:43 AM, shows Koon stating: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I just wanted to follow up on your client's discovery responses. It appears you have filed responses to the requests for admission but it does not seem we have gotten responses to the remaining discovery. Any update on these is appreciated.\u201d This message also carries the same firm signature block and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nTogether, these entries reflect ongoing follow-up attempts by The Whaley Law Firm to obtain responses to outstanding discovery in the Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler matter, with an expressed threat of a motion to compel if responses are not forthcoming.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024\nClient: Dana Jackson\n\nRe: Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson 24-CI-005774)\n\nIn the Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler matter, filed in Jefferson County (case number 24-CI-005774), an email thread between counsel reflects ongoing discovery disputes and scheduling. On February 17, 2025, Deborah Campbell Myers of Dilbeck & Myers PLLC sent a message to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm regarding the discovery responses. The email was sent in the context of the Dana Jackson client in the case and also referenced the discovery reviews with the opposing party, Mr. Kiebler. The subject line indicated the Finley & Jackson v. Kiebler matter.\n\nIn her February 17, 2025 email, Ms. Myers apologized for not responding to an earlier message. She stated that she had reviewed the discovery with Mr. Kiebler and was working on the responses. She explained that she was in a short trial that week and would be out of the office the following week, which would slow her ability to get the responses to Mr. Kiebler for his final review and signature. She requested the courtesy of an additional three weeks to complete the responses and thanked counsel for their professional courtesy. The message closed with her signature and contact information: Deborah Campbell Myers, Dilbeck & Myers PLLC, 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; Telephone 502-595-6500; Fax 502-595-6504; deborah@dilbeckandmyers.com. The email included a standard confidentiality notice indicating that the transmission contained private and confidential information and advising the recipient to notify the sender if received in error, with instructions not to disclose or rely on the information.\n\nThe February 17, 2025 email also shows the recipient, Bryce Koon, and the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard email footer, including the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone and fax numbers (Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207), along with a reminder that the message is attorney-client privileged or otherwise protected.\n\nEarlier in the thread, there are follow-ups from Bryce Koon. On February 17, 2025 at 1:07 PM, Bryce wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Following up again on the outstanding requests. Please advise when we may expect responses. If I do not hear back from you in this regard, I will be forced to file a motion to compel.\u201d This message also carried the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard disclaimer and contact information.\n\nPrior to that, on January 22, 2025 at approximately 3:32 PM, Bryce emailed again: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this one again \u2013 please advise when we may expect your client's responses in this regard.\u201d Again, the message included the firm\u2019s standard disclaimers and contact details.\n\nThe earliest referenced follow-up in this thread is from December 27, 2024 at 11:43 AM, in which Bryce wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, I just wanted to follow up on your client's discovery responses. It appears you have filed responses to the requests for admission but it does not seem we have gotten responses to the remaining discovery. Any update on these is appreciated.\u201d This email, too, included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard notice about privilege and forwarding restrictions.\n\nIn summary, the communications reflect a continuing dispute over outstanding discovery responses in the Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler case (Jefferson 24-CI-005774). The latest substantive message from Deborah Myers on February 17, 2025 requests a three-week extension due to trial commitments and upcoming absence, while Bryce Koon has repeatedly urged for the discovery responses and indicated that failure to provide them could lead to a motion to compel. The CC list on the February 17 email included Cecil Finley (Filevine Project Email Address), Dana Jackson (Filevine Project Email Address), Sarena Tuttle, and the Dilbeck & Myers \u201cAttorneys\u201d email address. The emails contain standard attorney-client privilege notices and confidentiality language, and each message preserves the attachments and signatures typical of professional correspondence in this matter.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes the discovery-related communications in Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson County, case number 24-CI-005774) involving Dana Jackson, in connection with the motor vehicle accident case file titled Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024. The principal counsel across the exchange were W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Deborah Campbell Myers, Esq., of Dilbeck & Myers PLLC. The subject line of the correspondence was Re: Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson 24-CI-005774). The email chain includes the following participants and recipients: Bryce Koon, Deborah Myers, Cecil Finley (Filevine project email), Dana Jackson (Filevine project email), Sarena Tuttle (Whaley Law Firm), and an \u201cAttorneys\u201d distribution list at Dilbeck & Myers. The messages contain standard confidentiality notices typical of attorney communications distributed to multiple recipients, stating that the emails are intended only for the named recipients and that if received in error, the sender should be notified and the information should not be disclosed.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, Bryce Koon wrote to Deborah Myers regarding outstanding discovery responses. He noted that while responses to the requests for admission had been filed, the parties had not yet provided responses to the remaining discovery requests, and he requested an update on those remaining responses. This email included the Whaley Law Firm contact information (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) and the Dilbeck & Myers contact information (8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504) in the signature blocks, along with the confidentiality notice.\n\nSeveral weeks later, on January 22, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up again on the outstanding discovery requests. In a message at approximately 3:32 PM, he asked for an update on when the opposing party would provide their client\u2019s responses and warned that he would be forced to file a motion to compel if no response was forthcoming. A subsequent follow-up that same day, at around 1:07 PM, reiterated the request: to advise when the client\u2019s responses could be expected, with the same warning about potentially filing a motion to compel if there was no timely response. These messages were also accompanied by the standard confidentiality notices and the signature blocks for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Deborah Myers replied to Bryce Koon. She apologized for what appeared to be a lapse in responding to his earlier email and explained that she had reviewed the discovery with opposing counsel, Mr. Kiebler, and that she was still working on the discovery responses. She noted that she was in a short trial that week and would be out of the office the following week, which would slow her ability to send the responses for final review and signature. She requested a courtesy extension of three weeks to complete the responses. She thanked Bryce for his professional courtesy in this regard. Her message included her firm\u2019s contact details (Dilbeck & Myers PLLC, 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504; deborah@dilbeckandmyers.com) and carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nIn response, Bryce Koon acknowledged his understanding of the situation and thanked Deborah for the update, adding that he would check back in a couple of weeks.\n\nThese notes reflect that the matter centers on discovery in the Jefferson County case Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (24-CI-005774), involving Dana Jackson as a client, and concern the timing and scope of responses to discovery requests, including admissions and the broader set of discovery requests. The communications reveal the parties\u2019 intent to avoid motion practice by coordinating timelines, with the February 17, 2025 exchange establishing a three-week extension request due to trial commitments and scheduling constraints on counsel.",

Justin Kiebler matter (Jefferson 24-CI-005774). In that message, she noted that the parties had completed a written discovery exchange and stated an intention to move forward with scheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions. She asked whether the clients\u2019 deposition of Mr. Keibler should be taken as well and advised that she had added her office to the email to assist with calendar coordination. Deborah requested several dates that would be convenient for both sides and expressed that she looked forward to hearing back. Her contact details were provided: Dilbeck & Myers PLLC, 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; Telephone 502-595-6500; Fax 502-595-6504; email deborah@dilbeckandmyers.com.

Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Rena Martin. She stated that their office and clients were available on any date between May 19 and May 30. She reminded that Mr. Jackson is an out-of-state resident and that his deposition would need to be conducted via Zoom. She closed by saying they looked forward to getting the depositions calendared.

      "natural_language": "Dana Jackson is a client in a motor vehicle accident case titled Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler (Jefferson 24-CI-005774). This note is a forwarded chain relating to scheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions, with the May 22, 2025 date ultimately proposed to proceed via Zoom. The forward was sent on April 23, 2025, by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Cecil Finley\u2019s Filevine email and Dana Jackson\u2019s Filevine email, along with counsel for the defendant. The message, dated 11:19:55 a.m. Eastern Time, stated that May 22, 2025 beginning at 10:00 a.m. would work. The email also included a standard privilege/confidentiality notice indicating the message is for the named recipients only and that a privilege may apply; if received in error, recipients should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or share the information.\n\nThe chain begins with a separate message from April 23, 2025, at about 7:53 a.m., in which the recipient list consisted of counsel and the firm\u2019s administrative assistant, Rena Martin at Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC. In that message, Rena asked for confirmation that May 22, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom is acceptable for the depositions of the Plaintiffs, and she indicated she looked forward to hearing from the recipients.\n\nEarlier, on April 16, 2025, at 9:56 a.m., Rena Martin of Dilbeck & Myers sent a reply to the Whaley firm (cc\u2019ing Deborah Campbell Myers and Bryce Koon) proposing that the depositions of the Plaintiffs be held on May 22, 2025, with Cecil Finley first at 10:00 a.m. and Dana Jackson immediately thereafter, both via Zoom. She asked the recipients to confirm that this schedule was acceptable so that Notices could be prepared.\n\nPrior to that, on April 15, 2025 at 4:22 p.m., Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, advised Rena that their office and clients could be available on any date between May 19 and May 30. Sarena noted that Mr. Jackson is an out-of-state resident and would need his deposition to occur via Zoom. She expressed an expectation to calendar these depositions and included her contact details.\n\nThere was a further exchange on April 15, 2025, at 12:51 p.m., when an email from the Dilbeck & Myers firm stated: \u201cThis will follow up on Ms. Myers\u2019 request for deposition dates in this matter. I look forward to hearing from you.\u201d The message was signed by Rena Martin, Administrative Assistant, with the Dilbeck & Myers contact information.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, Deborah Campbell Myers of Dilbeck & Myers\u2014addressed to Bryce Koon and with Sarena Tuttle and the Whaley firm cc\u2019d\u2014requested to move forward with scheduling plaintiffs\u2019 depositions now that written discovery was complete. Deborah asked whether Mr. Kiebler should also be deposed and noted that her office had been added to assist with scheduling. She asked for several dates convenient for all parties and clients and emphasized her willingness to coordinate. Her signature included her title, firm, address (8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222), phone and fax numbers, and a warning about the confidential nature of the transmission.\n\nIn summary, the series of emails documents the parties\u2019 efforts to schedule the depositions of the plaintiffs, Cecil Finley and Dana Jackson, in the case Finley & Jackson v. Justin Kiebler. The agreed or proposed plan, as repeatedly discussed in the chain, was to hold the depositions on May 22, 2025, beginning with Finley at 10:00 a.m. and Jackson immediately afterward, all via Zoom, with Dana Jackson\u2019s deposition noted as requiring remote participation due to his out-of-state status. The communications indicate that the notices would be prepared following confirmation, and they reflect coordination among The Whaley Law Firm, Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, and the involved clients.",

This followed Deborah Myers\u2019 prior message in the chain.\n\nDeborah Campbell Myers of Dilbeck & Myers PLLC had previously emailed Bryce Koon on Friday, May 30, 2025 at 10:27 AM. In that correspondence, she requested proposed dates for the rescheduling of the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions from May 22, 2025, and she advised that State Farm had sent a lien notice from Conduent regarding Mr. Finley, attaching the related notice. Deborah signed with the firm\u2019s details: Dilbeck & Myers PLLC, 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; Telephone: 502-595-6500; Fax: 502-595-6504; deborah@dilbeckandmyers.com. The email also contained the standard confidentiality notice, stating that the transmission contains private and confidential information, and instructing the recipient who received it in error to notify the sender and not to disclose, copy, distribute, or rely on the information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024. Client: Dana Jackson. This file relates to the matter captioned Finley, et al. v. Kiebler. The communications below concern scheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions and were exchanged among counsel on June 13, 2025, with prior outreach beginning May 30, 2025.\n\nOn May 30, 2025 at 10:27 a.m., Deborah Campbell Myers of Dilbeck & Myers PLLC sent an email to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm requesting proposed dates to reschedule the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions that had originally been set for May 22, 2025. Deborah also noted that State Farm had sent her the attached lien notice from Conduent regarding Mr. Finley. She asked to hear back and closed with well wishes for the weekend. Deborah\u2019s message included her contact details and a standard confidentiality notice stating that the email and transmitted documents contain private and confidential information, and that if received in error the recipient should notify the sender, avoid disclosure, and not use or forward the information.\n\nLater on June 13, 2025, at 9:58 a.m., Rena Martin, Administrative Assistant at Dilbeck & Myers, followed up on Deborah Myers\u2019 request for dates to reschedule the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions, inviting a response.\n\nIn the early afternoon of June 13, 2025, at 1:58 p.m., Bryce Koon replied to the chain, informing Deborah that he had spoken with his clients and asking whether they would be available on Tuesday, July 1, or Wednesday, July 2.\n\nLater that same day, at approximately 2:30 p.m., Deborah replied that she was not available on the proposed dates, but she was free all day on July 3 and asked if that would work. She also indicated that she would need to check with Mr. Kiebler.\n\nAt 2:49:15 p.m. (GMT-04:00) on June 13, 2025, Bryce responded that he was not available on July 3 and proposed alternative dates of July 9 or July 10. His message remained within the same thread and carried the standard attorney-contact information for The Whaley Law Firm, including his Louisville address, phone, and fax numbers, and the same recipient and CC list as the prior messages.\n\nThe thread includes multiple CCs: Attorneys at Dilbeck & Myers, Cecil Finley\u2019s Filevine project email, and Dana Jackson\u2019s Filevine project email. The subject line across the thread reads \u201cRe: Finley, et al vs. Kiebler.\u201d Each message in the thread includes the customary attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be shared if received in error; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nIn sum, the communications establish ongoing efforts to reschedule the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions in Finley, et al. v. Kiebler, with Deborah Myers proposing July 3 as an available date after the initial dates were found unavailable, Bryce Koon proposing July 1 or 2 or later dates (July 9 or 10), and no agreement reached as of the latest messages. The May 30 email also referenced a lien notice from Conduent related to Mr. Finley, and the thread maintained its standard confidentiality notices throughout.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes a June 2025 email thread about rescheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions in the Finley, et al. v. Kiebler matter, with Dana Jackson listed as the client in the Dana-Jackson-MVA-1-24-2024 file. The subject line for the exchanges is Re: Finley, et al vs. Kiebler. The initial message in this thread is an email from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, dated June 13, 2025, 3:11:34 PM Eastern Time, sent to Deborah Myers at Dilbeck & Myers, with copies to the Dilbeck & Myers attorney list and to the Filevine project email addresses for Cecil Finley and Dana Jackson. The body of that first message simply read, \u201cSounds good thank you.\u201d Bryce\u2019s signature follows, listing The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information. The transmission also includes the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer that accompanies this firm\u2019s electronic communications.\n\nThe thread continues with Deborah Myers\u2019s reply, sent the same day at 3:11 PM. Deborah states that she is available on 7/9/25, will place a hold on that date, and will reach out to Mr. Kiebler. She signs as Deborah Campbell Myers of Dilbeck & Myers, with the firm\u2019s address in Louisville and a notice reiterating the confidential nature of the communication.\n\nEarlier on June 13, 2025, Bryce had asked for availability on July 1 or July 2, indicating he was unable to meet on the 3rd. Specifically, at 1:58 PM he wrote to Deborah (and cc\u2019d the same recipients as before) asking, \u201cAre you all available Tuesday, July 1 or Wednesday, July 2?\u201d He added his WaSalut signature details after the message.\n\nDeborah responded at 2:30 PM the same day, informing Bryce that she is not available on those dates, that she is free all day on 7/3 if that works, and that she would need to check with Mr. Kiebler before confirming anything.\n\n Bryce replied again at 2:49 PM, noting that he is not available on the 3rd and proposing alternative dates: 7/9 or 7/10.\n\nDeborah followed up at 3:11 PM with confirmation that she is available on 7/9/25, that she would place a hold on that date, and that she would contact Mr. Kiebler. This message appears to be part of the same scheduling dialogue, continuing the effort to coordinate a deposition date.\n\nSeparately, in this email chain, there is an earlier communication from May 30, 2025, in which Deborah wrote to Bryce requesting proposed dates for rescheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions from May 22, 2025. Deborah also noted that State Farm had sent her an attached lien notice from Conduent concerning Mr. Finley. Deborah\u2019s May 30 message included her contact details for Dilbeck & Myers, as well as a confidentiality notice. The thread shows follow-up from Rena Martin, Administrative Assistant at Dilbeck & Myers, dated June 13, 2025 at 9:58 AM, indicating that this would follow up on Deborah Myers\u2019s request for deposition rescheduling and that she looked forward to hearing back.\n\nIn sum, the parties are arranging to reschedule the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions, with initial proposals for dates including July 1, July 2, and July 3 being rejected or uncertain, and a final tentative agreement emerging for July 9, 2025, with Deborah indicating availability and a plan to confirm that date with Mr. Kiebler. The communications involve Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm; Deborah Myers of Dilbeck & Myers; and participants associated with Dana Jackson and Cecil Finley via Filevine project email addresses. The case matter remains Finley, et al. v. Kiebler, and the deposition rescheduling discussion is tied to the broader Dana-Jackson-MVA file.",

      "natural_language": "Case context: The notes pertain to the Finley, et al. v. Kiebler matter, with Dana Jackson identified as a client (related to a separate Dana Jackson MVA matter). The communication thread on June 13, 2025, was between The Whaley Law Firm (W. Bryce Koon, Esq.) and the Dilbeck & Myers firm (Deborah Myers, with Rena Martin as administrative contact) regarding rescheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions and related matters.\n\nThe thread begins with an email from Bryce Koon dated June 13, 2025 at 3:28:52 PM, sent to Deborah Myers and copied to other attorneys and Filevine project addresses. In that email, Bryce responds with an uncomplicated, \u201cThat is fine with me for now,\u201d and signs his name and contact information. The message also includes The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Deborah Myers had asked Bryce to forward proposed dates for rescheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions, which had originally been scheduled for May 22, 2025. She also noted that State Farm had sent a lien notice from Conduent pertaining to Mr. Finley.\n\nOn June 13, 2025 at 3:12 PM, Bryce replied that he had checked with his clients and asked whether they were available on Tuesday, July 1, or Wednesday, July 2. Deborah responded at 2:30 PM the same day, stating that she was not available on those dates and was free all day on July 3, adding that she would also need to check with Mr. Kiebler.\n\nBryce replied at 2:49 PM, clarifying that he was not available on July 3 and proposing alternatives of July 9 or July 10. He signed off with his usual contact information. Deborah then sent a follow-up note at 3:11 PM indicating that she was available on July 9, 2025, and that she would place a hold on that date and reach out to Mr. Kiebler. Bryce responded shortly thereafter with a brief acknowledgment, saying \u201cSounds good, thank you.\u201d\n\nIn a later message from Deborah, she wrote, \u201cBryce, I just looked back and only the plaintiffs were originally scheduled; do you want to just do that again?\u201d which indicates a consideration of rescheduling the deposition of the plaintiffs consistent with prior arrangements. The thread ends with these discussions about dates, keeping the focus on rescheduling the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions in light of the lien matter and the coordination between the two firms.\n\nThroughout the thread, the parties reference proposed dates and availability, with the key tentative arrangement centering on July 9, 2025 as a potential deposition date, and with ongoing coordination about confirming attendance with Mr. Kiebler. The communications are anchored by the May 30, 2025 inquiry from Deborah about proposing new dates and noting the Conduent lien, and are followed by multiple back-and-forths on available dates in early July, leading to the tentative plan for July 9, 2025.",
