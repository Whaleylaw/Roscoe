Stevenson stated that if more VA treatment is to be included in the case, a list of the dates to be included should be provided so she can request that the case be reopened if needed. For the time being, the case would remain closed unless related dates were provided for billing.\n\nThe communication also notes that the VA claim was sent to the office on February 22, 2024. An eFax transmission record shows the claim was delivered successfully: Job/Fax ID 06c170bb-b740-43e8-b903-5d3a419f6f34, originating fax 14809071910, destination fax 15023649363, duration 436 seconds, 11 pages, with the subject line “Claim Asserted - ATTY - Wilder-Hamilton.” The claim was submitted on February 22, 2024 at 11:58:06 EST and delivered at 12:06:23 EST.\n\nPrior to these notes, Jessica Bottorff responded on October 4, 2024 that the office had received a bill, but the updated request was seeking anything beyond the date of service. Specifically, she asked whether there were any additional bills past the June 17, 2023 date of service.\n\nIn an earlier Oct. 4, 2024 message, Stevenson informed Bottorff that the VA claim balance regarding Robin Wilder-Hamilton (DOI 6/15/2023) was zero because Auto-Owners had paid the claim and the payment was posted on August 20, 2024. The case was therefore closed. Stevenson noted that the Revenue Law Group does not provide medical records; if medical records were needed, they must be requested from the Lexington VA Medical Center Business Office Release of Information at 1101 Veterans Drive, Lexington, KY 40502.\n\nThe email signatures repeatedly remind recipients to avoid sending PII via unsecured email, referencing the GCLAWS number for the case and advising secure handling of information. They also include notices about updated VA fax numbers, and links to VA resources such as the VA’s collections page, the My Health web portal for downloading records, and general veterans resources. The subject matter references that new third-party billing requests should follow VA guidelines, and new CHAMPVA billing requests should be directed to the VHA Community Care address. The communication stresses that the VA Subrogation process and medical bill requests require using the appropriate channels, and notes that veterans can access and download their own health records.\n\nWithin these communications, the case assignments listed by the VA Office of General Counsel include Lexington, Louisville, Mountain Home, and New Orleans, with mass litigation also noted.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Robin Wilder Hamilton (Case: Robin-Wilder-Hamilton-MVA-6-15-2023; Client: Robin Wilder Hamilton), the Revenue Law Group handled a VA subrogation matter connected to a motor vehicle accident that occurred on June 15, 2023. The file reference is 596-W-20231106-115744/GCL #537467/Wilder-Hamilton. In October 2024, a series of email exchanges took place between Jessica Bottorff of Whaley Law Firm and Louise Stevenson, a Paralegal Specialist with the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel (Revenue Law Group), regarding the VA claim and related billing.\n\nOn October 4, 2024, Stevenson informed Jessica that the VA claim balance for Robin Wilder-Hamilton (DOI: 6/15/2023) was zero and that Auto-Owners had paid the claim, with payment posted on August 20, 2024, after which the case was closed. Stevenson noted that the Revenue Law Group does not provide medical records and, if medical records were needed, they would have to be requested from the Lexington VA facility at VA Medical Center, Business Office, Release of Information, 1101 Veterans Drive, Lexington, KY 40502. Stevenson also provided broad contact details for the VA Office of General Counsel and emphasized several procedural points, including the updated fax numbers on the VA’s public website and references to the VA’s collections program for third-party billing. She included standard confidentiality notices and reminders to reference the GCLAWS number in correspondence, along with guidance on secure communications, and she listed VA resources such as myhealth.va.gov and vets.gov. Stevenson also included directions for new third-party billing requests and ChampVA billing, including the address for ChampVA submissions (VHA Community Care, P.O. Box 469062 741/04, Denver, CO 80246-9062; Fax 303/398-5116). Affected recipients were reminded that veterans can download and access their own health records.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:57 AM, Stevenson reiterated that the VA claim balance for Robin Wilder-Hamilton was zero and that Auto-Owners’ payment posted on 8/20/2024, resulting in a closed case. She again stated that the Revenue Law Group does not provide medical records and directed Jessica to request records from the Lexington VA Medical Center Release of Information at the address above. Stevenson also reiterated the confidentiality and security reminders, and again provided links for VA resources and instructions regarding third-party billing and ChampVA.\n\nAt 11:37 AM on October 4, 2024, Jessica Bottorff followed up with Stevenson, thanking her for the medical records information and requesting a copy of the bill itself. Stevenson’s earlier message did not include a bill copy, and Jessica requested it for the Wilder-Hamilton file.\n\nLater, at 2:04 PM on October 4, 2024, Jessica responded to Stevenson, acknowledging receipt of the VA’s claim balance information and clarifying that their updated request was for any charges beyond the date of service. Jessica asked whether there were any additional bills beyond the June 17, 2023 date of service.\n\nIn an earlier thread from October 4, 2024, Stevenson had noted that the VA claim had been transmitted to Jessica’s office on February 22, 2024, and she provided an EC Fax status for that transmission. The transmission was described as delivered successfully, with the following technical specifics: Job/Fax ID 06c170bb-b740-43e8-b903-5d3a419f6f34, originating fax 14809071910, destination fax 15023649363, duration 436 seconds, total pages 11, and the submission time of February 22, 2024 at 11:58:06 EST, with delivery completed at 12:06:23 EST. The subject of that fax was \"Claim Asserted - ATTY - Wilder-Hamilton.\"\n\nOn October 14, 2024, Jessica Bottorff sent a follow-up message confirming that she had reviewed Robin Wilder Hamilton’s medical records. She noted that the dates 06/17/2023, 06/29/2024, and an electronic consult (E-Consult) on 04/16/2024 appeared to be related to the matter, and that the firm would need billing documentation for those specific dates.\n\nIn sum, the VA claim for Robin Wilder-Hamilton was closed as of August 20, 2024 after Auto-Owners paid the claim, leaving a zero balance. The case remains closed unless additional related VA treatment is identified and a request to reopen is submitted. The Revenue Law Group advised that medical records are not provided by their office and must be requested directly from the Lexington VA Medical Center Release of Information; they supplied the address and relevant instructions. The parties discussed obtaining a copy of the bill beyond the date of service (with particular reference to 06/17/2023), and Jessica requested confirmation of whether there were any additional bills after that date. The October 2024 exchanges also included standard confidentiality and security notices, reminders to reference the GCLAWS number in correspondence, instructions about secure email practices, and notices about updated VA fax numbers and related resources. Finally, the correspondence included guidance on third-party billing through the VA, CHAMPVA billing procedures, and directions for veterans to access and download their own health records, with links to VA resources.",

      "natural_language": "In the case file for Robin-Wilder-Hamilton-MVA-6-15-2023, the client is Robin Wilder Hamilton. The material you provided centers on VA billing communications related to this matter, circulated as a forwarded chain under the reference 596-W-20231106-115744/GCL #537467/Wilder-Hamilton.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, Louise Stevenson of the VA Office of General Counsel notified the recipient that the billing for the 6/17/2023 date of service should already be in their system and had been sent on February 22, 2024. The email included a complete fax delivery confirmation for the 6/17/2023 date of service, noting: EC F ax status “Delivered Successfully,” Job/Fax ID 06c170bb-b740-43e8-b903-5d3a419f6f34, originating fax 14809071910, destination fax 15023649363, duration 436 seconds, and a total of 11 pages. The subject line was “Claim Asserted - ATTY - Wilder-Hamilton,” with the submission timestamp of 02/22/2024 11:58:06 EST and a delivery timestamp of 02/22/2024 12:06:23 EST. Stevenson indicated she would request a review of the other two dates that had not yet been billed and, if those dates were billable, would arrange billing for them. The message included Stevenson’s contact details and the standard Department of Veterans Affairs Office of General Counsel and Revenue Law Group signature block, along with guidance and links for third-party billing and ChampVA billing, as well as notices about PII and privacy, and several VA resources (including My HealtheVet and Vets.gov). The email body repeatedly referenced changes to VA fax numbers and directed recipients to verify fax numbers via the VA’s public site.\n\nEarlier correspondence in the chain shows additional discussion around related VA treatment dates. In an October 14, 2024 email, Jessica Bottorff of Whaley Law Firm wrote that, after reviewing the client’s medical records, the dates 06/17/2023, 06/29/2024, and an E-Consult on 04/16/2024 appeared to be related, and that billing would be needed for those dates. This message was sent in reply to a prior exchange from Louise Stevenson.\n\nIn an October 4, 2024 message, Stevenson stated that the VA claim had been sent to the office on 02/22/2024 and noted the fax delivery details (the same 06c170bb-b740-43e8-b903-5d3a419f6f34) and the associated submission/delivery times. Stevenson added that the case had been closed on 08/20/2024 when payment was issued to the VA; if Whaley Law was including more VA treatment in the case, they should provide the dates to reopen the matter for billing; otherwise, the case would remain closed.\n\nAlso on October 4, 2024, Jessica Bottorff acknowledged receipt of the VA bill but clarified that their updated request seeks billing only for dates beyond the originally billed date of service. Specifically, she asked whether there were any additional bills past the 06/17/2023 date of service and indicated that there were no additional bills beyond that date.\n\nIn a separate message from October 4, 2024, Stevenson reiterated that the VA’s claim had been sent on 02/22/2024 and again provided the ECFax delivery confirmation details. The same message reminded recipients that, unless dates to be billed are provided to reopen the case, it would remain closed.\n\nFinally, in the later October 2024 exchange, Jessica Bottorff clarified that, beyond the 06/17/2023 date of service, the dates 06/29/2024 and the E-Consult on 04/16/2024 appeared to be related, and that billing was needed for those dates as well.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, there is inclusion of standard privacy notices (Privileged and Confidential) and instructions to reference the GCLAWS number associated with the case in correspondence. The communications also include reminders that fax numbers and contact channels can change and point to VA resources for medical bills, records, and health portals. The entire thread reflects ongoing VA billing review efforts for the Wilder-Hamilton MVA case, with particular emphasis on ensuring that all related VA treatment dates are billed and that the case status (open or closed) is appropriately managed based on submitted dates.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin-Wilder-Hamilton-MVA-6-15-2023\nClient: Robin Wilder Hamilton\n\nInitial client contact: A missed call was logged on April 23, 2025 at 19:15:29.370000+00:00 for Bryce Koon concerning the Robin Wilder Hamilton motor vehicle accident case (MVA-6-15-2023). The call originated from Micheal McGee, with Caller ID 469-209-6541. A Filevine contact link is provided ([filevine-link]).\n\nVoicemail transcription: In the voicemail, the caller identifies as Mike from Sea Harbor Insurance in Dallas, Texas, calling regarding your client, Robin Wilder Hamilton (the transcript notes “your client, Robert Wilder, Hina Hamilton,” which appears to refer to the same person). He states that “the data loss on this 1 is a 600 1523” and that he had a “$4,000 new money offer for Miss Hamilton.” He asks to get the matter negotiated and settled, noting that the other party returned with “an absurd 25,000.” He reports having “$5,122.13 of medical” expenses and adds that much of the medical costs were from a VA medical center. He says, “I too am a United States Air Force [veteran] in Ohio” (the transcription reads “bedroom in Ohio that rules,” which appears to be garbled). He characterizes the case as having “not much to this,” though he could “increase this a little bit like the 4,500,” implying a potential settlement figure. He asks to be called back at the recipient’s convenience at the number 4692 209 6541. The message notes “sent 522” and provides the site claim number “C0119952.” As a personal aside, he states, “I was born at Norton’s in Burry at Louisville, Kentucky. My parents lived on Southern Parkway that was 19 61 anyway. Then we moved to months to San Francisco where my father got a job anyway and I did not know her name guy.” The voicemail ends with, “But hope we like to talk to you get this thing settled. All right, thank you, sir, bye.”\n\nAdditional details from the note: The call was logged as a missed call to Bryce Koon, and the message references the Filevine contact and the claim number C0119952. The caller’s name provided is Micheal McGee, with the phone number 469-209-6541 (and without dashes in some entries as 4692 209 6541). The case context remains the Robin-Wilder-Hamilton-MVA-6-15-2023, with the client listed as Robin Wilder Hamilton.",
