      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in the matter Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, captioned Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate. On June 30, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC (on behalf of Stephanie Nail at the request of Allstate) regarding service of process in that case. The subject line of the correspondence was Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate. The email was addressed to Stempien with copies to A. Campbell Ewen and Aaron Whaley, and was sent from Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines were D: (502) 365-9435 and O: (502) 583-4022, and her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nEarlier that day, at 2:20 PM, Sarena wrote to Mr. Stempien noting that settlement discussions were welcome if the office wished to make an offer. She stated that, per CourtNet, Nail’s client had been served via Certified Mail on 06/15/2022, and she expected to receive an Answer on behalf of Mrs. Nail on or about 07/15/2022. She advised that if settlement discussions were needed, they could be had directly; in the meantime, she attached the Interrogatories propounded upon the client and the Complaint dated 06/15/2022, and invited discussion about the claim in more detail. The email included her firm’s contact information and carried the standard firm signature, which again listed The Whaley Law Firm’s address and her phone numbers and email, with a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nAt 2:25 PM, Brian Stempien replied, asking what information demonstrated good service, because, in his view, the return of service stated only COVID-19. His message included his firm’s details: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, located in the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1 (866) 431-3599; E-Mail: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Web: http://www.thslaw.co. The email was accompanied by the firm’s standard Privileged and Confidential disclaimer, noting that the information is attorney privileged and confidential and not intended for unauthorized recipients, and that no attorney-client relationship is formed by sending or receiving email.\n\nIn reply, at 2:37 PM, Sarena stated that the question of whether service is “good” or not is not for her to decide, and that service is listed as “Successful.” She noted that if the opposing party wished to file an Answer and then dispute the validity of service, that was up to them and/or their client, and she would note the concern for Aaron to address further. She signed again with her Whaley Law Firm contact details.\n\nThe thread also contained standard email disclosures and signatures. The messages carried the usual Attorney Privilege and Confidentiality notices, a disclaimer that no Attorney-Client Relationship is created by email, and the IRS Circular 230 warning regarding tax advice. The emails also contained a Proofpoint Essentials note indicating that the messages had been scanned for spam and viruses, and included an embedded image reference. The attachments referenced in the messages were the Interrogatories and the Complaint served on 06/15/2022.",

Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with A. Campbell Ewen and Beth Alexander copied. The subject concerned service and potential changes in the litigation. Stempien wrote that, with respect to service, the return attached to the electronic file on Courtnet shows the word “COVID” spelled out, and that his position at that time was that this did not constitute effective service. He asked that if the recipients disagreed or intended to file a motion for default, they should let him know. He added that he recalled a discussion about a 30-day extension of the time to answer by agreement and asked to be advised whether the opposing side opposed extending the deadline through August 1. He also asked whether there was an intention to move to amend the Complaint, suggesting that if such an amendment were planned, they might as well wait to see what happens when it is attempted to be served on Ms. Nail.

It also stated that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving email with the firm, and it included the IRS Circular 230 warning about tax advice and the requirement to provide extensive disclosures in certain written tax communications; the note explained that because the document does not contain all such disclosures, one may not rely on any tax advice contained within.\n\nEarlier, on June 30, 2022, Sarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The client is Destiny Adkins, and the matter is styled Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate. The communications spanning June and July 2022 involve counsel for Destiny’s side—the Whaley Law Firm—and counsel for Stephanie Nail’s side—Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC—with several recipients CC’d, including Sarena Tuttle, A. Campbell Ewen, and Beth Alexander. The exchange centers on service of process, extensions of time to respond, and potential amendment or settlement discussions in the underlying case following Destiny Adkins’s motor vehicle accident on April 16, 2021.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, with Aaron Whaley and A. Campbell Ewen also copied. In this message, Tuttle thanked Stempien for his letter dated June 28, 2022 noting representation of Stephanie Nail at the request of Allstate. She stated that the firm is open to settlement discussions at any time and, if an offer is forthcoming, is willing to discuss. However, she noted, per CourtNet, that Stephanie Nail had been served via Certified Mail on June 15, 2022, and Destiny’s team looked forward to receiving Nail’s Answer on or about July 15, 2022. Tuttle also advised that if further discussion or information was needed regarding settlement, contact could be made directly to discuss the claim in more detail, and she attached the Interrogatories propounded upon Nail along with the Complaint dated June 15, 2022. The message listed Sarena M. Tuttle’s contact information, including the Louisville, Kentucky address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and phone numbers, and noted a new email address for correspondence. The email also included the customary firm signatures and disclaimers, including spam/virus scan notation from Proofpoint Essentials and the standard “Privileged and Confidential,” “No Attorney-Client Relationship,” andIRS Circular 230 disclosures typically accompanying such correspondence, as well as the firm’s disclaimer about the limitations of tax advice and the prohibition against using the document for marketing purposes. The message also contained the sender’s and recipients’ respective email signatures and contact details.\n\nOn July 14, 2022, at approximately 10:50 a.m., Brian D. Stempien replied to Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle. He commented on service: the return attached to the electronic file on CourtNet allegedly shows the word “COVID” spelled out, and he stated that, in his view, this does not constitute effective service. He asked to be informed if there is a disagreement or if a motion for default is planned. He then recalled, or stated his recollection, that there had been a discussion about a 30-day extension of the time to Answer by agreement, and he asked to know whether the opposing party would be opposed to extending through August 1. He also asked whether the clients intended to move to amend the Complaint and suggested that if amendment is planned, it might be prudent to wait to see what happens when Nail is served with the amended complaint. The email concluded with Stempien’s standard contact information for Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, including address in the Jefferson Marders Building, Louisville, KY, and telephone numbers, as well as the firm’s website.\n\nAt 11:02 a.m. on the same day, July 14, 2022, Aaron Whaley responded to Stempien. He stated that he had no objection to an extension through August 1, and that if Allstate were to extend coverage, he would have no objection to an indefinite extension while he attempted to resolve the claim with Allstate. His reply was also copied to Sarena Tuttle, A. Campbell Ewen, and Beth Alexander, and it was sent from Whaley’s email address agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nThe record also reiterates that the parties referenced the CourtNet status with Nail’s service by Certified Mail on June 15, 2022, and there is ongoing discussion about extending deadlines, service validity, and the possibility of amending the Complaint. The messages include typical case-specific content such as the inquiry about a default motion should service be challenged, and whether an extension to August 1 would be opposed. The communications also reflect that counsel contemplated potential settlement discussions, the status of Nail’s service, and the procedural steps necessary to move the case forward, including whether to serve an amended complaint.\n\nIn addition to the substantive exchange, the emails carried standard firm-specific formalities: the July 14 emails included the usual privileged/confidentiality notices, no attorney-client relationship disclosures, and disclaimers regarding the IRS Circular 230 regulations governing tax advice in written communications. The correspondence also included boilerplate language about email disclaimers and the sender’s firm identity, with the final contact details for Aaron Whaley and The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIn sum, the matter Destiny Adkins v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate involved an ongoing dialogue in mid-2022 about service validity, deadlines to answer, potential amendments to the Complaint, and possible settlement discussions, all within the context of Destiny Adkins’s motor vehicle accident case arising on April 16, 2021. The parties agreed to consider extensions and contested service in the Courtnet record, while counsel also exchanged positions on settlement opportunities and the proper handling of the complaint and any amended pleadings.",

      "natural_language": "In the Destiny-Adkins-MVA case (case file Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021) for client Destiny Adkins, the notes concern responses to a DC discovery request in the Adkins & Downs v Nail, Allstate & Unk Driver matter. On Thursday, April 6, 2023, at 11:53:42 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Aaron Whaley, with Joel Franklin cc’d, providing Adkins’ response to the DC Disc Req for approval prior to submission. In that message she described the client as difficult to communicate with and seem­ing disinterested in the case, and she noted that scheduling a deposition would be difficult.\n\nSarena’s email signature in that message reiterated her role as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the contact numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104. Her email was listed as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating this is a new address.\n\nEarlier that same day, around 9:48 a.m., Sarena wrote that they had requested cell phone information via IROGs but had not yet received the defendants’ answers.\n\nIn the thread from the prior day, Wednesday, April 5, 2023, Aaron Whaley had asked at 6:36 p.m. whether cell records had been requested on this case yet.\n\nEarlier still, at 3:40 p.m. on April 5, Sarena wrote: “Hey guys, please find attached the Resp to DC Nail’s Disc Req for Juanita Downs. Please review for approval before sending to DC & Filing NOS w/ Jefferson County Circuit Court.” She noted that the companion case for Destiny Adkins’ responses was in progress, and she highlighted that the Theft/Crime Report shows the vehicle was reported stolen AFTER the MVA, not before, attaching the file “2023.04.05 Downs Resp to DC Disc Req.pdf.”\n\nSarena’s message again carried her signature with the same firm details and new email address. The thread also included the closing signature from Aaron Whaley, with his firm’s name, address at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and his contact number at 502-583-4022.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The client is Destiny Adkins, and the matter is styled Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate.\n\nOn April 21, 2023 at 2:42 PM (the email header shows “Fri, 21 Apr 2023 14:42:21 -0400”), Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm forwarded a message to Sarena Tuttle regarding the Adkins & Downs v Nail & Allstate matter. The forwarded thread begins with a note from Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, responding to Aaron. Brian wrote that his carrier is pressuring him to file a motion to compel and asked for updates on deposition dates and discovery. He signed the message with the firm’s full contact information: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1-866-431-3599; E-Mail: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Web: http://www.thslaw.co. The email contains the standard Privileged and Confidential notice indicating that the information is intended for the named recipient and that no attorney-client relationship is formed by sending or receiving the email, along with the sender’s and recipient’s acknowledgement of that disclaimer. The message also includes the IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure warning, explaining that the document may not contain all required tax disclosures and that tax advice should not be relied upon to avoid penalties.\n\nIn the chain, there is a preceding exchange from Aaron Whaley dated March 22, 2023 at 9:37 AM, which states that they were working on completing discovery responses and dates, and acknowledges a minor miscommunication with Sarena about redoing service due to a prior objection.\n\nThe thread also contains a prior message from Brian Stempien dated March 21, 2023 at 5:02 PM. In that email, Brian asked when they could expect the client’s discovery responses and deposition dates. He noted that they had received a “peculiar filing of the complaint again today” and asked whether that was intentional or if there was anything missing. He stated a desire to close the loop on Ms. Nail’s discovery and indicated that obtaining the client’s responses and her deposition should be their first priority.\n\nIn addition to the April 2023 exchange, the thread includes older correspondence from July 2022. On July 14, 2022, at 11:03 AM, Aaron Whaley replied to Brian Stempien (with Sarena Tuttle, A. Campbell Ewen, and Beth Alexander cc’d) indicating that he had no objection to an extension to August 1 and, if Allstate extended coverage, would object to an indefinite extension while attempting to resolve the claim with Allstate.\n\nEarlier that same day, July 14, 2022 at 10:50 AM, Brian Stempien sent a message to Aaron and Ms. Tuttle with an important service-related discussion. He noted that the return attached to the electronic file on Courtnet spelled the word “COVID,” and stated his position that this was not effective service. He asked Aaron to indicate if they disagreed or if they intended to file a motion for default. Brian also recalled that they had discussed a 30-day extension of the time to Answer by agreement and asked to know whether there was opposition to extending through August 1. He further asked whether Aaron intended to move to amend the Complaint and suggested that they might wait to see what happens when attempting to serve Nail.\n\nThe July 2022 correspondence also shows the standard confidential and privileged-notice markings common to communications from these law firms, including the same No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer and the Circular 230 tax-disclosure language.\n\nThe emails include the usual contact details for the parties’ counsel. Aaron Whaley’s messages and the forwarded communications reference the ongoing discovery and deposition scheduling in the Adkins & Downs v Nail & Allstate matter, with Brian Stempien representing the opposing side and requesting timely responses and dates, while Aaron and Sarena Tuttle coordinate the client’s discovery responses and service issues. The case remains a motor vehicle accident matter involving Destiny Adkins, with the case caption reflecting Adkins as a plaintiff and Stephanie Nail and Allstate as defendants. The communications also reference the law firms’ offices and contact information, including Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC in Louisville, and Whaley Law Firm, with their respective emails and websites, and the standard protective disclaimers that accompany professional emails in this matter.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. In the matter captioned Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, a series of email exchanges in 2023 reflects ongoing discovery and deposition scheduling. On June 2, 2023, at 17:38:51 UTC, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, wrote to Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle with the Whaley Law Firm. He proposed trying to set the depositions of the opposing clients in June if possible and asked Sarena to contact Beth (Beth Alexander) regarding dates and other details; he also asked Aaron to call him when he had a moment. Stempien’s signature block lists the firm’s address in Louisville, KY, along with office, fax, toll-free numbers, email, and website, followed by the standard Privileged and Confidential disclaimer, the No Attorney-Client Relationship notice, and an IRS Circular 230 tax warning.\n\nEarlier, on April 24, 2023, at 11:36 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Brian, apologizing for the delay and attaching the Plaintiff’s responses to the discovery requests. She stated that depositions were flexible and asked whether Brian and his client were available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, noting that depositions could be conducted via Zoom or at Brian’s office. The message references three attachments: “2023.04.18 Adkins & Downs NOS Resp to DC Disc R...” and two others named “2023.04.18 Adkins Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf” and “2023.04.18 Downs Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf.” The email footer includes Sarena’s contact information, including her title, the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, direct line, office line with extension 104, and her new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, followed by the standard Privileged and Confidential disclaimer and related notices.\n\nThe April 21, 2023 chain of messages shows a forwarded note from Brian Stempien, dated April 21, 2023, at 2:09 PM (times rendered as “2:09?PM” in the record). In this message, Brian told Aaron Whaley that his carrier was pressuring him to file a motion to compel and requested updates on deposition dates and discovery. The email ends with Stempien’s signature block and the customary disclaimer about privilege and relationship.\n\nEarlier still, on March 22, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied to Brian Stempien at 9:37 AM, indicating that they were working on finishing the discovery responses and noting a bit of confusion between himself and Sarena. Aaron mentioned that he had assigned Sarena a task to redo service due to a prior objection.\n\nFinally, on March 21, 2023, at 5:02 PM (noted as “5:02?PM” in the record), Brian Stempien wrote to Aaron Whaley. He asked when they could expect the client’s discovery responses and dates for the deposition. He also mentioned receiving a peculiar filing of the complaint again that day and inquired whether it was intentional or if there was anything missing. He stated that they were working to close the loop on Ms. Nail’s discovery but wanted the client’s responses and her deposition set on the books as a top priority. Stempien’s message included his firm’s contact information and the standard privileged/relationship disclaimers.\n\nAcross these communications, the exchanges consistently reference depositions, discovery responses, and scheduling, with multiple attachments and negotiations over dates and methods (in-person vs. Zoom). The emails consistently include the Privileged and Confidential notices, the no attorney-client relationship disclaimer, and the Circular 230 tax warning.",

I had sent her a task to redo service since you had raised a prior objection.” This reply continued with Aaron’s signature block and the same customary disclaimers regarding privilege, no attorney-client relationship, and the IRS tax disclosure requirements.\n\nLater, on April 21, 2023, Brian forwarded a message to Aaron (and carbon-copied Beth Alexander) stating that his carrier was pressuring him to file a motion to compel and requesting information about deposition dates and discovery. The forwarded message was part of the ongoing exchange between the firms, and Brian again provided his contact details and the standard legal-disclaimer footer.\n\nOn April 24, 2023, Sarena Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Brian (and with Aaron CC’d). She apologized for the delay and advised that the Plaintiff’s Responses to the Discovery Request were attached. She also stated that they were flexible on deposition dates and asked whether Brian and his client were available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, noting that depositions could be conducted either via Zoom or in Brian’s office. Sarena’s signature block followed, including her contact information at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the direct line and the office line, and her new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, Brian sent another message to Aaron and Sarena: “Let’s try to get the depositions of your clients set in June if that will work. Please contact Beth concerning dates, etc.” He further asked Aaron to call him when he had a moment. Brian’s message carried his firm’s contact information and the standard disclaimers.\n\nThen, on June 6, 2023, Sarena Tuttle responded to Brian (and included Beth Alexander in the thread). She stated that their office was available on June 20, 22, 27, or 29 for the depositions and that they would like to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day, anticipating that the proceeding would take a full day for all three depositions.\n\nThroughout these communications, the governing case remained Destiny Adkins as the client, and the matter at issue was Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate. The depositions were being coordinated for June, with the Nail deposition to be scheduled on the same day as the others, and the participation of all three depositions anticipated to require a full day. The messages also reflect prior discussions about discovery responses, including the attachment of the Plaintiff’s Responses, and various scheduling options (in-person or via Zoom) as the parties worked to resolve deposition dates and related discovery issues. The communications include standard attorney disclaimers and contact information typical of the firms involved: The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena Tuttle) and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC (Brian Stempien), with the respective addresses, phone numbers, emails, and the acknowledged warnings about privilege, no attorney-client relationship, and tax disclosures.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins.\n\nIn the matter of Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, the depositions scheduling discussions involved Destiny Adkins and several counsel and staff from two law firms. The earliest relevant communications in this thread begin with an email from Beth Alexander, paralegal to Brian Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (with copies to Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley) on June 6, 2023. Beth notes that June 29 is the only date on which Brian is available to take two depositions in one day, and that Brian will not agree to three depositions in a single day. She asks Sarena to propose dates, perhaps the following week, to schedule Ms. Nail’s deposition at their office. Beth provides her contact information: Beth A. Alexander, Paralegal to Brian Stempien, Travis Herbert & Stempien, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025. The email thread includes standard attorney‑client privilege and confidentiality notices.\n\nEarlier in the chain, Sarena Tuttle responds to Beth on the same day, June 6, 2023, at 10:51 AM. She states that their office is available for depositions on June 20, 22, 27, or 29, and that they would like to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day, anticipating a full day to cover all three depositions. Sarena signs as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line is 502-357-9971, main line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting that it is a new address. This message also contains the standard privilege disclaimer and confidentiality notices.\n\nThe thread also contains prior scheduling discussions. On June 2, 2023, Brian Stempien wrote to Aaron Whaley and Sarena, urging that the depositions be scheduled in June if possible, and asking them to contact Beth concerning dates. He also asked Aaron to call him when possible. Brian’s contact details are listed as Travis Herbert & Stempien, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office 502-245-7474; Fax 502-245-7025; Toll Free 1-866-431-3599; email bstempien@thattorneys.com; website http://www.thslaw.co. The message is accompanied by standard Privileged and Confidential notices.\n\nPrior to June, the thread goes further back to an April 24, 2023, email from Sarena to Brian (with Aaron copied), in which she apologizes for a delay and attaches the Plaintiff’s Responses to Discovery Requests. She notes that deposition dates are fairly flexible and asks if the client is available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, offering to conduct the depositions via Zoom or at the client’s office. She references attachments: NOS Resp to DC Disc R (April 18, 2023), Adkins Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf (April 18, 2023), and Downs Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf (April 18, 2023). This email also includes the Whaley Law Firm’s standard signature with the same privilege and confidentiality notices and the indication that Sarena’s email address is the new one.\n\nEarlier still, on April 21, 2023, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message from Brian Stempien to Aaron and to Beth Alexander. Brian explains that his insurer is pressuring him to file a motion to compel and asks for depositions and discovery dates, requesting that Aaron coordinate and provide the dates. Brian’s contact information (same as above) is included in this forwarded thread.\n\nIn summary, the deposition scheduling in this matter progressed through several correspondences from April through June 2023. Key points include:\n- April 21, 2023: Brian requests deposition dates and discovery coordination; asks Aaron to assist and to coordinate with Beth.\n- April 24, 2023: Sarena provides plaintiff discovery responses, proposes deposition dates (May 23, 25, 30, or June 1), and offers Zoom or in-office depositions; attachments are included.\n- June 2, 2023: Brian asks to set depositions in June and to contact Beth for dates; requests a call.\n- June 6, 2023: Sarena identifies available dates for depositions (June 20, 22, 27, or 29) and proposes taking Nail’s deposition the same day; anticipates a full day for all three depositions; notes Sarena’s new email address.\n- June 6, 2023: Beth responds that June 29 is the only date Brian can accommodate for two depositions and that he will not agree to three in one day; she asks for alternative dates the following week to schedule Nail’s deposition at their office; provides Beth’s contact details.\n\nAll of these messages include the standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality disclosures, the practice of noting “No Attorney-Client Relationship,” and, in several emails, references to attached documents and image attachments referenced as embedded images within the messages. The communications collectively map out the coordination among Destiny Adkins’s case team and opposing counsel toward scheduling the depositions of Stephanie Nail and related parties.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents the deposition scheduling discussions in the Destiny Adkins personal injury matter (Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate). The exchange spans an April 2023 email and several June 2023 messages among the plaintiff’s and defense counsel, centered on arranging depositions for Ms. Nail and the other parties, with an emphasis on minimizing the number of depositions in one day.\n\nOn April 24, 2023, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm informed Brian Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien that they were apologetic for the delay and attached the plaintiffs’ responses to discovery. She noted that deposition dates were flexible and asked whether counsel and their client were available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, and that depositions could be conducted either via Zoom or in the defense office. The email referenced attachments containing the plaintiffs’ responses to the discovery requests. Sarena’s signature blocks included her contact information and new email address.\n\nOn June 2, 2023, Brian Stempien responded to Aaron Whaley and Sarena, urging that the depositions for the clients be set in June if possible. He asked Aaron and Sarena to contact Beth concerning dates and indicated that Aaron should call him when available.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at 10:51 AM, Sarena sent a reply to Beth Alexander stating that their office was available for depositions on June 20, 22, 27, or 29, and that they would like to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day, anticipating a full day for all three depositions. Sarena’s message was cc’d to Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley, with her contact details reaffirmed in the signature block.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:09 PM, Beth Alexander replied that June 29 was the only date among the proposed options on which Brian was available for two depositions; she noted that Brian would not agree to three depositions in one day and asked for alternative dates in the following week for scheduling Ms. Nail’s deposition at their office.\n\nAlso on June 6, at 12:23 PM, Sarena responded, acknowledging that three depositions in a single day are a lot. She suggested that because the week of the 4th of July is the following week, they could do the 6th, or, looking at the week after that, the 11th or 12th. Her message included her standard contact details and reiterated the scheduling possibilities.\n\nFor reference, the email chain included multiple professional signatures with the parties’ law firms and contact information, including Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, KY; Beth Alexander, paralegal to Brian Stempien at Travis Herbert & Stempien, Louisville; and Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, with their respective office addresses and telephone numbers. The thread also contained the customary attorney-privilege disclaimers typical of such communications.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in the motor vehicle accident matter Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, styled Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate. The correspondence below records pre-trial deposition scheduling and a status update on the deposition of Stephanie Nail.\n\nIn the series of June 6, 2023 emails, the Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien coordinated the deposition logistics. Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal at The Whaley Law Firm, sent Beth Alexander, paralegal to Brian Stempien at Travis Herbert & Stempien, a notice to take deposition of Mrs. Nail for July 12, 2023, starting at 2:00 PM in Beth Alexander’s office, as agreed. Earlier that day, Beth asked whether the plaintiff’s deposition would be taken at the defense’s office or the plaintiff’s office. Sarena replied that they prefer Zoom, but they could conduct the deposition at Beth’s office if needed. Beth then responded, indicating appreciation and that she would forward the notice as soon as possible. An additional message from Sarena conveyed that she would get the notice over to Beth as soon as possible. The formal deposition notice itself was delivered by Sarena on June 6, 2023 at 1:39 PM, specifying that the deposition of Mrs. Nail would occur on July 12, 2023, at 2:00 PM in Beth Alexander’s office, as agreed, in the matter Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate. The exchanges included standard privileged and confidential disclaimers typical of the firms involved, including statements that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving email, and notices about IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure requirements.\n\nThe parties and contact details involved in these communications were: Beth A. Alexander, Paralegal to Brian Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, located in the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, KY 40243, with phone (502) 245-7474 and fax (502) 245-7025; and Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct dial (502) 357-9971, main office (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address for the new email address). The messages also carried the firms’ standard “Privileged and Confidential” notices, indicating that the information is attorney-privileged and confidential and that dissemination to unintended recipients is prohibited, along with the standard disclaimer that no attorney-client relationship is created by email, and the required Circular 230 tax disclosures.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, Beth Alexander wrote to Sarena Tuttle reporting difficulty confirming the deposition. Specifically, Beth stated that they had been unable to reach Ms. Nail to confirm the deposition scheduled for tomorrow, and that Brian Stempien was confident she would not appear. Beth noted that they had not been able to locate Ms. Nail since their initial conversation, and that she would inform Sarena if Ms. Nail’s status changed.\n\nThis narrative reflects the chain of scheduling discussions, the formal deposition notice, the parties and firms involved, the proposed deposition timing and location, the preference for Zoom versus in-person attendance, and the status update indicating an anticipated nonappearance risk for Ms. Nail as of July 11, 2023.",

Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent a notice to Beth A. Alexander, a paralegal at Travis Herbert & Stempien, regarding the deposition. The message included a notice to take the deposition of Mrs. Nail on July 12, 2023, beginning at 2:00 p.m., to be held at Beth’s office “as agreed.” Earlier that day, Beth asked whether the Plaintiff’s deposition would be at their office or theirs. Sarena responded that they preferred Zoom but could do Beth’s office, and Beth replied, “Great… thanks.” The notice was provided in a follow-up message from Sarena, dated June 6, 2023 at 1:39 p.m., stating the deposition would start at 2:00 p.m. on July 12, 2023, at Beth’s office as agreed.\n\nThe June 6 exchange also included standard attorney-client and tax-disclosure disclaimers typical of the firms’ email communications.

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins, the client in the Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021 case, had a deposition confirmed for July 12, 2023 (docket number 84274). The deposition was scheduled in the matter of Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al., with Stephanie Nail listed as the judge/witness. The location for the proceedings was Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky, 40202, and the contact phone number given was 502-245-7474. The client listed on the confirmation was Aaron Whaley, Esquire, of The Whaley Law Firm. The date and time shown for the deposition were July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, Kristina Wenninger, Scheduling Manager for Kentuckiana Court Reporters, sent an email with the subject Re: Confirmation for 7/12/2023 (84274). The email attached the confirmation for tomorrow’s proceeding and requested that it be reviewed to confirm whether it would go forward as scheduled or if revisions were necessary. The confirmation indicated that the only requested service was a Court Reporter (the box for Court Reporter was checked), while other services—Videographer, Interpreter, Conference Room, ZOOM Connection, and Telephone Conference—were not selected. The header of that message included Kentuckiana Court Reporters’ office details: A: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202; P: (502) 589-2273; F: (502) 584-0119; E: Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com. The message also included a note thanking the recipient for scheduling with them and contained a standard confidentiality disclaimer about the information being privileged or confidential and not to be filed publicly.\n\nEarlier that same morning, at 11:34 AM, Kristina Wenninger wrote to the recipients that the attached confirmation should be reviewed to confirm whether the proceeding would proceed as scheduled or if revisions were necessary. At 11:41 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied: Good afternoon, we are still on for tomorrow, and as far as she was aware there had not been any cancellations. Her signature included her title and contact information, and she noted the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The timing and sequence continued with a brief 11:43 AM reply from Kristina Wenninger simply saying “Thank you!” followed by the same scheduling details from Kentuckiana Court Reporters. Finally, at 12:09 PM on July 11, 2023, Sarena responded that, just moments after her prior reply, the Defense canceled the deposition. She apologized for the change in status. Her message again carried her contact details and the note to use her new email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The client in this matter is Destiny Adkins.\n\nIn the deposition scheduling chain related to a matter titled Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (case style listed as Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al., with Destiny Adkins as the underlying client in the MVA matter dated 04-16-2021), a deposition was set for July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM. The named attorney on the schedule was Aaron Whaley, Esquire, of The Whaley Law Firm, in what appears to be a matter for his firm. The location for the proceeding was listed as Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky, with a contact phone number of 502-245-7474. The case ID associated with the scheduling note is 84274.\n\nThe correspondence began with Kristina Wenninger, Scheduling Manager at Kentuckiana Court Reporters, sending a note to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm indicating there was no problem removing the appointment from their calendar and that a cancellation confirmation would be sent shortly. McKenna Watson, the Scheduling Assistant, signed the message, which was dated July 11, 2023, and included Kentuckiana Court Reporters’ contact information: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-589-2273; fax 502-584-0119; email Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarena Tuttle had replied to Kristina Wenninger that, just moments after responding, the defense canceled the deposition. Sarena identified herself as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line was 502-357-9971, her office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104, and her email address was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating the address was a new email address.\n\nIn a prior message at around 11:34 AM on July 11, 2023, Kristina Wenninger had attached the confirmation for the following day’s proceeding and requested review to confirm whether the schedule would proceed as written or whether revisions were needed. The confirmation listed a single selected option: Court Reporter (checked), with other services (Videographer, Interpreter, Conference Room, ZOOM Connection, Telephone Conference) left unchecked.\n\nSarena Tuttle then replied later in the morning, around 11:41 AM, indicating that the deposition was still on for tomorrow and that, to her knowledge, there had not been any cancellations. She reiterated her role and contact details, including her new email address.\n\nSubsequently, at approximately 12:09 PM, she informed that, just moments after the earlier message, the defense canceled the deposition. She offered apologies for the change.\n\nFollowing that sequence, McKenna responded at 4:10 PM UTC on July 11, 2023, confirming that they would remove the matter from their calendar and would send a cancellation confirmation shortly.\n\nThe email thread ends with a final scheduling notice reiterating the scheduled details for July 12, 2023, at 2:00 PM, with Aaron Whaley, Esquire, of The Whaley Law Firm listed as the client contact for the matter Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al., with Stephanie Nail identified as the witness, and the location specified as Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky, 502-245-7474.\n\nThe closing of the thread includes a standard scheduling acknowledgment: “Thank you for scheduling with us,” followed by a confidentiality notice stating that the information in the email is intended solely for the named recipient, may be privileged or confidential, and may be exempt from disclosure under Federal Rules of Evidence 408 or other laws; recipients should not file copies of the email with publicly accessible records.

The communication confirms that the parties agreed to a meeting time and that the proposed date and the location—Ms. Nail’s appearance—were being scheduled in connection with the Jefferson Circuit Court case referenced above.\n\nIn sum, the email exchanges between The Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, between September 28 and October 9, 2023, relate to a filing in Jefferson Circuit Court (case 22-CI-002878) and to scheduling a meeting concerning Ms. Nail for Wednesday, October 18, at 2:00 p.m. in the office of the opposing counsel.

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. This notes the matter Adkins and Downs v. Nail, et al. in Jefferson Circuit Court (case number 22-CI-002878). The following is a sequence of email communications among counsel for the parties.\n\nOn September 28, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to counsel with a brief update: please see the attached filing that was submitted today in Jefferson Circuit Court. The message included his firm’s contact information—The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207—and carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer stating the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and that recipients should not use or forward the information if received in error. A spam- and virus-scan notice from Proofpoint Essentials appeared at the bottom of the email.\n\nTwo weeks later, on October 7, 2023, Brian D. Stempien, of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, replied to Bryce Koon with a scheduling proposal. He wrote that they had actually located Ms. Nail and asked whether Wednesday, October 18, at 2:00 p.m. in their office would work for Bryce Koon’s side. Stempien provided his firm’s details: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, in the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; office phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; toll-free 1-866-431-3599; email bstempien@thattorneys.com.\n\nOn October 9, 2023, at 11:16 a.m., Bryce Koon replied, signaling agreement with the proposed arrangement. He wrote, “Counsel, This will work for us,” and included his standard firm signature and confidentiality disclaimer indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be used or shared if received in error. His contact details were The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207.\n\nLater that same day, October 9, 2023, at 3:26 p.m. UTC, Brian Stempien sent a follow-up: “Assuming this works for Campbell, we will get this set up. Let me know if you are not alright with doing this here. I would like to minimize the logistical challenges for obvious reasons.” He closed with his Travis Herbert & Stempien signature block and the same standard privileged/ confidential notices. The email reiterated that the message and any attachments are intended for the recipient and that sending or receipt does not establish an attorney-client relationship; it also included the IRS Circular 230 tax information disclaimer about the disclosure obligations for tax advice in written communications.\n\nThe thread includes additional formalities typical of attorney communications. Bryce Koon’s messages consistently carried the confidentiality notices stating the electronic communication is for the named recipient and should not be disseminated if received in error, and Brian Stempien’s messages carried the same notices, including the standard disclaimer about no attorney-client relationship being established by sending or receiving emails and the IRS tax-advice warning where applicable.\n\nThroughout, the exchanges were CC’d to additional recipients to share context: acewen@ewenandkinney.com, Sarena Tuttle, and Beth Alexander, with the communications preserving their respective roles in the matter. The messages also contained the usual electronic-disclaimer language and a note that the emails may include attorney-privileged or otherwise protected information.\n\nIn summary, the communication chain from September 28 to October 9, 2023, reflects counsel coordinating a meeting to discuss the Adkins and Downs v. Nail matter, with a proposed in-office meeting to discuss Ms. Nail’s location (having located her) and a proposed date of Wednesday, October 18, at 2:00 p.m., contingent on Campbell’s agreement. The thread includes complete contact details for both law firms, standard confidentiality and privilege notices, and the customary notices about no attorney-client relationship being created by email.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in the motor vehicle accident matter Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case number 22-CI-002878, commonly referenced in the file as Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The note documents a sequence of email exchanges between counsel regarding whether to dismiss certain parties from the case and how that might be conditioned on admissions or statements in pleadings and discovery responses. The parties to the communications include The Whaley Law Firm, representing Destiny Adkins, and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, representing the opposing side, with other recipients copied on the messages. The case caption reflects the underlying motor vehicle accident on April 16, 2021.\n\nIn an email dated January 16, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent counsel correspondence to Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, and kpkinney@ewenandkinney.com, with the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). The body stated, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” The message was cc’d to Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address (DestinyAdkinsMVAZ1161425@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address (JuanitaNicoleDownsMVAZ954678@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The Whaley Law Firm’s signature provided the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 364-9363. The email carried the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer asserting confidentiality and the prohibition on dissemination or use if the message was received in error, along with the notice that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving e-mails, and included an IRS Circular 230 tax disclaimer.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, Brian D. Stempien, of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, replied to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d, under the subject RE: Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). Stempien asked, “Aaron and Bryce: Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” Stempien’s contact information appeared in the message: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1 (866) 431-3599; Email: bstempien@thattorneys.com. The message included the firm’s standard confidentiality and privilege notices, the “No Attorney-Client Relationship” disclaimer, and the accompanying IRS Circular 230 tax disclosures.\n\nEarlier, on September 3, 2024, Stempien again addressed the matter in an email beginning, “Guys: Are you going to let my lady out of this case?”—a reference to Ms. Nail. The message was sent from Stempien to the same recipients and included the same customary firm signature blocks and disclaimers, emphasizing privilege and confidentiality, the absence of an attorney-client relationship, and the tax-disclosure language required by Circular 230.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the CC list consistently included Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address, reflecting their involvement or potential relevance to filings or updates in Jefferson Circuit Court. The emails consistently carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of attorney communications, including warnings about inadvertent receipt, the lack of an attorney-client relationship by e-mail, and, where applicable, the tax-disclosure language mandated by the IRS Circular 230. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details—712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365-5043; fax (502) 364-9363—are reflected in the January 16, 2024 message, while Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC’s details—11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office (502) 245-7474; Fax (502) 245-7025; Toll Free (866) 431-3599—appear in the July 22, 2024 message.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in the motor-vehicle-accident matter styled Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 22-CI-002878. The matter is identified in the record as the Destiny-Adkins-MVA case with the underlying event on April 16, 2021. The listed client for this matter is Destiny Adkins.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, a communication concerning the Destiny Adkins v. Nail case was sent from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Brian D. Stempien and an address at kpkinney@ewenandkinney.com, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d. The subject line read Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). In the body, Bryce Koon stated, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court. Thank you, W. Bryce Koon, Esq.” The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information appeared beneath, including its Louisville, Kentucky address at 712 Lyndon Lane, and phone and fax numbers. The message carried the standard attorney-privileged and confidential notice, cautioning that the email is intended only for the named recipient and that disclosure, distribution, or use by others is prohibited; it also included the usual disclaimer that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and directed the recipient to consult the firm’s website for the disclaimer. The email also contained the IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure warning, noting that tax advice in the document may be limited and that the recipient may not rely on any tax advice in it to avoid penalties.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, at 5:13 PM, Brian D. Stempien, of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, sent a reply to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d, regarding the same Jefferson Circuit Court case (Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Nail, 22-CI-002878). The subject line echoed the prior matter. In the body, Stempien wrote, “Aaron and Bryce: Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” Stempien’s firm information followed, including its address at the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, plus office numbers (502) 245-7474, fax (502) 245-7025, toll-free (866) 431-3599, and the email bstempien@thattorneys.com, with the firm’s website listed as http://www.thslaw.co. The message again included the Privileged and Confidential notice restricting dissemination, the statement that no attorney-client relationship is created by email, and the IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure warning.\n\nEarlier, on January 16, 2024, Bryce Koon’s January email was followed by the standard Privileged and Confidential notice and the same disclaimers regarding attorney-client privilege and the lack of an established attorney-client relationship, as well as the Circular 230 tax warning. The January message reiterated that the attached filing had been submitted in Jefferson Circuit Court for Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al., case number 22-CI-002878, and listed Bryce Koon’s firm details and contact information from The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects three key communications around the Destiny Adkins matter in Jefferson Circuit Court: (1) a January 16, 2024 email from Bryce Koon noting an attachment filed that day; (2) a July 22, 2024 reply from Brian Stempien asking if Ms. Nail would be released from the case and inviting discussion; and (3) a September 3, 2024 email from Brian Stempien reiterating the inquiry with the line, “Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” Each message includes the standard Privileged and Confidential notice, no attorney-client relationship clarification, and the Circular 230 tax warnings, and each identifies the same case caption and docket (Destiny Adkins v. Stephanie Nail, Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). The parties to the correspondence include Destiny Adkins, the Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley), and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC (Brian D. Stempien), with Sarena Tuttle cc’d on the communications.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins, the client in the motor vehicle accident matter Destiny Adkins v. Stephanie Nail, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case 22-CI-002878 (designated in the file as Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021), is the subject of an email exchange dated September 3, 2024. The correspondence involves counsel Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, along with several other recipients listed in the CC field, including Destiny Adkins MVA-related Filevine project emails and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA-related Filevine project emails. The overall topic concerns possible dismissal of certain parties from the case and the conditions for such dismissal, within the context of the Jefferson Circuit Court docket.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Brian Stempien and kpkinney@ewenandkinney.com, with Sarena Tuttle CC’d, under the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). In that message, Koon wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” The email was sent from The Whaley Law Firm, with Bryce Koon’s contact information provided: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 364-9363. The message carried the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer and related notices typical of such communications, including statements about no attorney-client relationship arising from the transmission and references to IRS Circular 230 disclosures where applicable.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, Brian D. Stempien replied to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, with Sarena Tuttle CC’d, under the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). In his message, Stempien asked: “Aaron and Bryce: Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” He signed with his firm’s contact details: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1-866-431-3599; Email: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Website: http://www.thslaw.co. The message included the firm’s customary privileged and confidential notices, confirming that no attorney-client relationship is created by receipt and reiterating the standard disclaimers and policy statements common in such communications. The email chain also includes references to the attachments and a general warning about privilege and tax-disclosure requirements as part of the signature blocks, mirroring the practice seen in other emails from the same exchanges.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on September 3, 2024, at approximately 12:10 PM, Stempien sent a follow-up message asking: “Guys: Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” This message, like the others, included Stempien’s contact information and the firm’s customary confidentiality and privilege notices, including explicit disclaimers about attorney-client relationships and the guidelines required by IRS Circular 230. The signature block contains his office address in Louisville, with the same general warnings about confidentiality and the prohibition on disseminating the content if the recipient is not the intended recipient.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 12:19 PM on the same day, Bryce Koon replied to Brian Stempien with a direct conditional offer: “Good afternoon Brian, We will agree to dismiss your client from the case if she amends her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission. Outside of that, I do not believe we can agree to voluntary dismissal of your client.” He provided his standard Whaley Law Firm signature, including the firm’s Louisville address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), phone number (502) 365-5043, and fax (502) 237-3207. The message again carried the firm’s privilege and confidentiality notices and related disclaimers.\n\nIn sum, the September 2024 email thread shows ongoing settlement discussions about voluntary dismissal of a party from Destiny Adkins v. Stephanie Nail, et al., with a specific condition: the opposing party would be dismissed if Destiny Adkins’ Answer and/or discovery responses were amended to assert that Defendant Turner operated the vehicle with permission. Absent that amendment, the parties indicated they were not willing to pursue voluntary dismissal. The correspondence also reflects a broader pattern of coordination among counsel across the Whaley Law Firm and the Stempien firm, the inclusion of multiple Filevine project email addresses in CC lines, and the presence of standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notices in each message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. This note covers the Destiny Adkins v. Stephanie Nail et al. matter in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 22-CI-002878, with the underlying motor-vehicle accident having occurred on April 16, 2021. The file, titled “RE: Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878),” includes a sequence of email exchanges dated in July and September 2024 between counsel at Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm, regarding the possible dismissal of Destiny Adkins from the case and related conditions.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, at 5:13 PM, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC sent an email to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm (with Aaron Whaley also copied, along with Sarena Tuttle and two Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021). The subject line mirrored the case caption. In the body, Stempien asked, “Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” His signature block followed, including his firm’s address at the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, phone numbers, fax, toll-free line, and website. The message carried the customary attorney-privilege and confidential-information notices, including a disclaimer that no attorney-client relationship is established by email, and standard IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure language.\n\nEarlier that same day (or in the same thread), the parties’ contact blocks again show the involved offices and the same confidentiality and privilege disclaimers.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, later in the day, Brian Stempien sent a message to Bryce Koon (and others on the original thread). The subject line again referenced Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. While the note itself is short, it reads, “Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” followed by Stempien’s contact and disclaimer block. The message reiterated the ongoing concern about Destiny Adkins’ status in the case and included the same privilege/confidentiality language, the “No Attorney-Client Relationship” disclaimer, and the Circular 230 tax-warning text.\n\nAlso on September 3, 2024, Bryce Koon replied to Brian Stempien. The email, dated around 12:19 PM, stated: “Good afternoon Brian, We will agree to dismiss your client from the case if she amends her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission. Outside of that, I do not believe we can agree to voluntary dismissal of your client. If you have any questions in this regard, please feel free to contact me at the number below.” The reply was sent with Bryce Koon’s signature block for The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, including a phone number and fax number. The message was accompanied by the firm’s standard confidentiality notice, including a note that an image in the signature had been removed by the sender, and the usual “This electronic message is intended only for the named recipient” disclaimer.\n\nFinally, at approximately 4:33 PM (UTC) on September 3, 2024, Brian Stempien responded to the thread with the line: “Yeh.. not going to happen. I guess we will have to file something.” He again included his standard signature block and the same Privileged and Confidential language and the no-attorney-client-relationship disclaimer commonly included in outgoing emails for his firm.\n\nThroughout the thread, the participants, in addition to Stempien (Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC) and Koon (The Whaley Law Firm), included Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle on the Whaley side, plus Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address as CC recipients in the earliest message. The correspondence also references, and is accompanied by, the standard “Privileged and Confidential” notices and the disclaimer about no attorney-client relationship, as well as the IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure language.\n\nThe communication trail reflects an ongoing strategic discussion about whether Destiny Adkins would be dismissed from the case, and under what conditions that dismissal could occur. Specifically, Bryce Koon proposed that Destiny could be dismissed if she amended her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission; otherwise, a voluntary dismissal of Destiny Adkins was not anticipated. The sequence shows that Brian Stempien pushed for a prompt resolution that would remove Destiny from the case, while stating his intent to “file something” if a resolution could not be reached. The record also preserves the contact details for the two law firms and the Filevine project email addresses tied to Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs, as well as the standard legal disclaimer language that accompanied every transmission.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the email communications connected to the case Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, in which Destiny Adkins is the client. The matter is Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al., in Jefferson Circuit Court (case number 22-CI-002878). The note reflects correspondence from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, regarding discovery in that case.\n\nOn October 22, 2024, Bryce Koon wrote to counsel about the outstanding discovery requests directed at Defendant Turner, asking if there was any update and indicating that any information would be appreciated. The message appears with a timestamp noted as 2:39?PM. The email concluded with Bryce Koon’s signature, which identifies him as an attorney at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. A standard confidentiality disclaimer followed, stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and warning against disclosure if received in error.\n\nThen, on Friday, November 1, 2024, at 12:56:49 PM Eastern Time, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up regarding the same matter. The subject line of this message was Re: Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). The email was sent to Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm, with CCs to Destiny Adkins’ Filevine project email address (DestinyAdkinsMVAZ1161425@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Juanita Nicole Downs’ Filevine project email address (JuanitaNicoleDownsMVAZ954678@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), along with Sarena Tuttle. The body of the message stated: “Good afternoon counsel, Again following up on the discovery to Defendant Turner. Any update appreciated.” The message included Bryce Koon’s standard firm signature and contact information identical to the October 22 email, and it carried the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nIn sum, the note documents two sequential requests from Bryce Koon, dated October 22, 2024 and November 1, 2024, seeking updates on discovery from Defendant Turner in the Jefferson Circuit Court case Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al., 22-CI-002878, with Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs as CC’d stakeholders and Filevine emails listed for the clients.

      "natural_language": "In the Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021 case, with Destiny Adkins as the client, the matter is styled Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court docket 22-CI-002878, related to a motor vehicle accident dated April 16, 2021. The record shows two email exchanges in late 2024 between the firms handling the case and related parties.\n\nOn October 22, 2024 at 2:40 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Eric S. Rice and Daniel Gumm regarding the Adkins & Downs v. Turner case. The subject of the message was “Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878).” In the body, Bryce asked whether there was any update regarding the outstanding discovery requests and requested any information that could be provided. The message was CC’d to Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address, Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address, and Sarena Tuttle. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details were provided: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message followed with a standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the electronic communication may contain privileged or protected information, and a reminder that the message is intended only for the named recipient.\n\nEarlier, on November 4, 2024 at 15:14:02 UTC, Eric S. Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, replied to Bryce (with Daniel Gumm also on the chain and the same CCs). In his message to Bryce, Eric stated, “Hello Bryce, I am trying to track my client down and will let you know as soon as I make contact with him.” Eric’s signature block identified Rice Gumm, PLLC, located at 12804 Townepark Way, Suite 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-290-1075; email eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com; and website www.ricegummlaw.com. The message carried a confidentiality notice asserting privilege and restricting disclosure where applicable, and also included a note that a black-and-white logo was part of the correspondence. The email was sent from Eric Rice and was addressed to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with the same CCs indicating the Destiny Adkins MVA Filevine email, the Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Filevine email, and Sarena Tuttle, and it included the standard attorney-client confidentiality warning.\n\nOverall, the record reflects two late-2024 communications related to the Adkins & Downs v. Turner matter: an October 22 email from Bryce seeking updates on outstanding discovery requests, and a November 4 reply from Eric Rice indicating he was attempting to locate his client and would provide an update once contact was made. Both messages contain the standard confidentiality notices customary for attorney communications.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in a motor vehicle collision matter captioned Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al. in Jefferson Circuit Court (docket 22-CI-002878). The case file for Destiny Adkins, associated with the MVA occurring on 04/16/2021, contains a sequence of email communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC regarding a motion and discovery responses. The correspondence involves Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs as co-parties in the matter, with cc recipients including Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Filevine project email addresses, as well as Brian Stempien of That Attorneys, and Daniel Gumm of Rice Gumm.\n\nOn November 12, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Eric S. Rice and Daniel Gumm, with cc to the Destiny Adkins MVA Filevine project email address, the Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Filevine project email address, and Brian Stempien. The subject was Adkins & Downs v. Turner, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). In that email, Bryce attached the motion filed that day and informed counsel that the motion was set for Monday, November 25, 2024. He stated that if he received the clients’ responses prior to that date, he would remand the motion and invited any questions.\n\nLater, on November 21, 2024, at 10:22 a.m., Eric Rice replied. He explained that he had spoken with Demetrius that morning and that he would be leaving the following day to go home for Thanksgiving, returning December 2. He would not be able to meet with Demetrius until December 4 to obtain discovery responses. Rice asked Bryce to remand his motion-to-compel (MTC).\n\nShortly thereafter, at 10:47 a.m. on the same day, Bryce Koon responded. He thanked counsel for the update and acknowledged that the responses had been outstanding for some time. He stated that he owed it to his clients to ensure progress, and he agreed to roll the motion two weeks to December 9, 2024. Bryce explained that this extension would allow counsel to meet with their client, and he added that should he receive the responses by that date, he would remand his motion.\n\nThe message from Bryce also included his firm’s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. Eric Rice’s message included his contact information for Rice Gumm, PLLC: 502-290-1075; eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com; 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; website www.ricegummlaw.com. The email chain also contained standard confidentiality and attorney‑client privilege notices referencing that the electronic messages and attachments may contain legally privileged information, and instructions to contact the sender if received in error and not to disclose or forward the information.\n\nIn sum, the parties discussed a motion in the Adkins & Downs v. Turner case, with a schedule contingent on obtaining discovery responses. Bryce initially set the motion for November 25, 2024, with a potential remand if responses were received. Eric Rice indicated he could not secure discovery responses until December 4, due to Thanksgiving travel, and requested remand of the MTC. Bryce agreed to extend the deadline to December 9, 2024, contingent on receiving the necessary discovery responses by that date, and confirmed his intent to remand if those responses were supplied.",

Turner. On January 21, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as the new address), emailed Mary Stephenson at kycourts.net requesting that a CD be produced containing the audio/video for the hearings on April 15, 2021; May 14, 2021; and July 16, 2021. The firm preferred electronic delivery and indicated they were happy to pay over the phone if possible, inviting any questions and offering to discuss details by phone. The message was sent to the Jefferson County Court videodepartment with copy to Bryce Koon, and included the standard external-email disclaimers typical of such messages.\n\nMary Stephenson replied later that day, acknowledging the information and stating that they would get to work on the request. She noted that they could only prepare the CD in DVD format and that they would call when it was ready.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Mary had asked for the specific courtroom numbers where these events occurred,: “We will need to know which court room numbers these events happened in (Example CT rm 102, 302, etc.).”\n\nIn a subsequent message, Sarena responded to the videodepartment (with Mary copied and Bryce Koon also included) to reiterate the request for a CD containing the audio/video for the hearings on April 15, 2021; May 14, 2021; and July 16, 2021, and reiterated a preference for electronic delivery with a willingness to pay by phone. This message again included the standard note indicating that some recipients do not frequently receive emails from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com and the external-sender warning. In this communication, Sarena also explained that, based on the Citation and CourtNet records, there was no showing of a 04/15/2021 Hearing Room, but that the case had been transferred to room 303 for the May and July hearings, and she included her contact details once more.\n\nLater, at 2:16 PM, Mary Stephenson replied again, thanking Sarena for the information and indicating that they would proceed with preparing the CD, noting that they could only prepare it on a DVD and would contact them when it was ready. The thread closed with Sarena replying at 2:26 PM with appreciation: “That would be great, thank you,” and signing her full contact information.",

In that message, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., wrote to counsel for the opposing side, Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm, with Brian Stempien, Destiny Adkins MVA Filevine project email address, Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Filevine project email address, and Sarena Tuttle copied as recipients. The subject line was Re: Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. Koon requested assistance in scheduling Mr. Turner’s deposition and asked that the recipients provide Mr. Turner’s availability for the coming weeks. The message was signed with the standard practice details: Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, Phone: (502) 365-5043, Fax: (502) 237-3207.

In this message, also from Bryce Koon, Esq., the tone is a request to follow up on the previous request, stating: “Good afternoon counsel, I am writing to follow up on my previous request. Any update is appreciated.” The message again was addressed to Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm and copied to Brian Stempien, the Destiny Adkins MVA Filevine project email address, the Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Filevine project email address, and Sarena Tuttle.

The same attorney-client privilege disclaimer was included, indicating that the electronic communication is intended only for the named recipient, may contain privileged information, and that if received in error the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nIn sum, this file contains the case identifiers and client, the initial deposition-scheduling request from January 21, 2025, including the recipients and the request for Mr. Turner’s availability, followed by a January 28, 2025 follow-up reiterating the request and maintaining the same contact details and confidentiality disclosures.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The client is Destiny Adkins and the matter captioned Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. is a motor vehicle accident case arising from an event on 04/16/2021. This note records a sequence of email communications among counsel regarding scheduling Mr. Turner’s deposition.\n\nIn the email thread, dated February 21, 2025 (transmitted through multiple messages in late January and early February 2025), The Whaley Law Firm’s Bryce W. Koon and Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for the firm, coordinated with Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, and Daniel Gumm. The cc list also included Brian Stempien, Destiny Adkins’ Filevine project address, and Juanita Nicole Downs’ Filevine project address, along with Destiny Adkins’ and Juanita Downs’ Filevine project emails. The subject line referenced the case Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al.\n\nOn January 21, 2025, Bryce Koon requested counsel’s assistance in scheduling Mr. Turner’s deposition and asked for his availability in the coming weeks. He requested a prompt reply and signaled that the deposition would be part of ongoing litigation management. He closed with his endorsement and firm contact information from The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nBryce followed up on January 28, 2025, writing, “Good afternoon counsel, I am writing to follow up on my previous request. Any update is appreciated,” again requesting Mr. Turner’s deposition availability. His message included his standard firm contact details and a note indicating this electronic communication is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Eric S. Rice replied that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. He signed as a partner of Rice Gumm, PLLC, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky office address and contact information, and with the usual confidentiality notice following his message.\n\nThe thread progressed on February 4, 2025, when Eric Rice sent a response stating that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, February 14, February 18, February 19, or February 20, if those dates were workable. He again included his contact details and the firm’s confidentiality notice.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied on February 5, 2025, indicating that February 20 is the only date that would work for The Whaley Law Firm due to their calendar of mediations and depositions for the month. She asked for clarification on whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office. She noted that if Mr. Turner remained incarcerated, the parties would need to check with the jail regarding process and availability. This message included her updated contact details, including a new email address, and the firm’s standard disclosure about confidentiality and privileged information.\n\nIn summary, the deposition scheduling efforts involve coordinated efforts between The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC, with proposed dates centered on February 12, 14, 18, 19, and 20 at 3:30 p.m., and a constraint from The Whaley Law Firm that only February 20 would work given their existing mediation and deposition load, plus a live question about Mr. Turner’s incarceration status and whether the deposition would be held at the defense counsel’s office or at the opposite party’s location. The Filevine project emails for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs were included in the correspondence as part of the case file tracking.",

      "natural_language": "On February 5, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mr. Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, regarding the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter ( Destiny Adkins, the client in Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021). The message noted that February 20th is the only date out of a list that works for The Whaley Law Firm, as they already have several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month. Sarena asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition could take place at Rice Gumm’s office, and she added that if Mr. Turner remains incarcerated they would need to check with the jail about its process and availability. The email was sent from Sarena to Eric and was CC’d to Bryce Koon, Daniel Gumm, Brian Stempien, Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address, and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address. Sarena included her work contact information and noted a new email address.\n\nThis exchange followed prior scheduling inquiries regarding Mr. Turner’s deposition. On February 4, 2025, Eric S. Rice replied to Bryce Koon, stating that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, if those dates worked. Eric’s message included his professional contact details and a confidentiality notice, consistent with the firm’s standard email format.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on January 31, 2025, Eric Rice had written to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with Brian Stempien and the Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA filevine project emails CC’d, to indicate that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. He signed as a partner of Rice Gumm, PLLC, with his contact information and the confidentiality notice.\n\nPrior to that, on January 28, 2025, Bryce Koon had sent a message to Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm, with Brian Stempien and the same Filevine project emails CC’d, requesting an update and following up on his previous request regarding Mr. Turner’s deposition. The message concluded with Bryce’s firm details and a standard confidentiality notice.\n\nGoing further back, on January 21, 2025, Bryce Koon had written to counsel requesting assistance in scheduling Mr. Turner’s deposition and asking for availability for the coming weeks. This message also included Bryce’s contact information and a confidentiality notice.\n\nThe email chain thus documents ongoing efforts to schedule Mr. Turner’s deposition in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. case, with multiple parties copied and a preference established for conducting the deposition on February 20, 2025, pending Mr. Turner’s incarceration status and the logistics of where the deposition would occur.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. The matter at issue is Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. This note summarizes a February 2025 email thread between The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC regarding scheduling a deposition for Mr. Turner in the Adkins/Downs matter.\n\nParticipants and contact details\n- The Whaley Law Firm: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, based at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Direct dial 502-357-9971; Office 502-583-4022 ext 104. Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (note: new email address). The firm’s address and the telephone numbers appear in the signature blocks.\n- Rice Gumm, PLLC: Eric S. Rice, Partner, located at 12804 Townepark Way, Suite 200, Louisville, KY 40243. Office phone 502-290-1075; Email: eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com. Website: www.ricegummlaw.com.\n- Other counsel copied in the thread include Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm), Daniel Gumm (Rice Gumm, PLLC), Brian Stempien (address shown as That Attorneys.com in the CC), and filevine-backed project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA.\n- Filevine project emails: Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 - DestinyAdkinsMVAZ1161425@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com; Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 - JuanitaNicoleDownsMVAZ954678@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nTimeline and key details\n- February 5, 2025, 12:00 PM: Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Eric Rice (and CC’d others) in response to a scheduling request. She stated that the only date that works for their office is February 20, 2025. She noted they have several Mediations and Depositions scheduled that month and asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or would attend the deposition at Rice Gumm’s office; if incarcerated, they would need to check with the jail about processes and availability. The message included Sarena’s standard signature and confidentiality notice.\n- February 5, 2025, around 1:50 PM: Eric S. Rice replied to Bryce and Daniel Gumm (and cc’d others). He indicated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates worked.\n- February 5, 2025, 1:56 PM: Sarena Tuttle responded, thanking Mr. Rice for the information and asking whether Mr. Stempien could confirm whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him.\n- February 5, 2025, 3:30 PM (approximate in thread time): Eric Rice replied with a concise note: “He’ll be here at my office.” This affirmed that Mr. Turner would attend the deposition at Rice Gumm’s office.\n- February 5, 2025, 3:56 PM (approximate): Sarena followed up with a final confirmation email. She thanked Mr. Rice for the confirmation and again asked Mr. Stempien to confirm whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him. Her signature block was included with the Whaley Law Firm contact information.\n\nLocation and logistical considerations\n- The deposition location discussed is Rice Gumm, PLLC, at their Louisville office. There is explicit discussion of whether Mr. Turner would appear in person at Rice Gumm’s office or if his incarceration status would affect the process; if incarcerated, jail procedures and availability would need to be checked. The suggested deposition date that ultimately appeared viable for the Whaley office was February 20, 2025, at 3:30 PM.\n\nConfidentiality and boilerplate\n- Each email in the thread carried the standard confidentiality notice typical of attorney communications, reminding recipients that the message may contain privileged information and should not be disclosed or forwarded by unintended recipients.\n\nIn summary, the parties coordinated by email to schedule Mr. Turner’s deposition in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail case, with February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice Gumm, PLLC identified as the workable slot for the Whaley Law Firm, contingent on confirmation from Mr. Stempien. Eric Rice indicated Mr. Turner would be present at Rice Gumm’s office, and the thread includes the involved counsel and relevant filevine addresses for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The client in this matter is Destiny Adkins, and the case caption is Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with the underlying matter dated 04/16/2021.\n\nInitial scheduling attempt (January 21, 2025). W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to request Mr. Turner’s deposition availability for the coming weeks in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail case. He asked the opposite counsel to provide times that would work for scheduling the deposition.\n\nFollow-up on January 28, 2025. Bryce Koon followed up again, requesting an update on Mr. Turner’s deposition availability.\n\nResponse from January 31, 2025. Eric S. Rice, Partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, replied that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. His message included his contact information: 502-290-1075 and eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com, along with the Rice Gumm firm address, and carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nProposed times (February 4, 2025). Eric Rice advised that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, 2025, if those dates worked. The message was sent from Rice Gumm, PLLC, with Eric Rice’s signature block and the firm’s contact details.\n\nProposed date narrowed (February 5, 2025, 12:00 PM). Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded that the only date that works for their office from the previously listed options is February 20, 2025. She noted that they had several mediations and depositions scheduled for February and asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office; if the client remained incarcerated, they would need to check with the jail regarding process and availability. Her message included her contact details and new email address.\n\nConfirmation of the February 20 date (February 5, 2025, 1:50 PM). Eric Rice replied that Mr. Turner would be “here at my office,” confirming his client’s availability for the deposition at Rice Gumm, PLLC. The signature block again provided Rice Gumm’s contact information.\n\nFollow-up on the 3:30 p.m. time (February 5, 2025, 1:56 PM). Sarena Tuttle thanked Eric Rice for the confirmation and asked Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm would work for him, including her standard sign-off with her contact details.\n\nSchedule conflict introduced (February 6, 2025, 14:35:04 +0000). Krista Rice, Firm Administrator at Rice Gumm, PLLC, emailed to note a scheduling conflict for February 20 and to request alternative dates. She proposed February 24, 26, 27, or 28 as possible options and asked the recipients to advise which of those dates would work. Her message included her full contact information and the firm’s address.\n\nAdditional context and participants. The email chain involves multiple parties: Krista Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC) as the sender of the February 6 note; Sarena M. Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm) as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager; Eric S. Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC) as Partner; W. Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm); Destiny Adkins (MVA client from 04/16/2021); and Juanita Nicole Downs (MVA 4/16/2021) referenced in the Filevine project addresses. The communications were exchanged among these parties with copies to additional firm personnel, and all emails contained standard confidentiality notices. The case involves the deposition of Mr. Turner related to the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter, with the deposition location and timing being negotiated across January and February 2025. The conference chain shows a preference for February 20 at Rice Gumm, but scheduling conflicts necessitated alternative dates (2/24, 2/26, 2/27, or 2/28) as of the latest note.",

      "natural_language": "In February 2025, the law firms representing Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs were coordinating a deposition in the matter of Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. Destiny Adkins is the client in the Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) case filed on 04/16/2021. The correspondence involved The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC, with the two clients CC’d on the communications via Filevine project email addresses: Destiny Adkins MVA Z1161425 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA Z954678. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, communicated from their Louisville, Kentucky office, and noted a new email address for herself. Her details were: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe scheduling discussion began with a series of emails among Bryce Koon and Eric Rice at Rice Gumm, PLLC, and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. On January 28, 2025, Bryce Koon emailed Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm, with Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA CC’d via their Filevine project email addresses. Eric Rice replied on January 31, 2025, that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. He also provided his contact information: Eric S. Rice, Partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-290-1075; eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com.\n\nEric Rice followed up on February 4, 2025, stating that Mr. Turner could be available for a deposition at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, if those dates would work. Sarena Tuttle responded on February 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM, noting that only February 20 would work for Whaley’s office due to other Mediations and Depositions scheduled that month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or would appear at Rice & Gumm’s office, adding that if he were incarcerated they would need to coordinate with the jail regarding process and availability. Eric Rice replied at 1:50 PM that Mr. Turner would be at Rice & Gumm’s office. Sarena then asked at 1:56 PM whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr. Stempien.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Krista Rice responded at 9:35 AM, indicating a scheduling conflict for February 20 and requesting alternatives: February 24, 26, 27, or 28. In a follow-up email at 9:57 AM, Sarena Tuttle explained the constraints: February 24 is a Monday reserved for local motion hour, and February 28 is a Friday reserved for Fayette motion hour. She stated that the firm was available on February 26 or 27, but she requested an earlier start time of 1:00 PM.\n\nIn summary, the parties were working toward setting a deposition for Mr. Turner (the client from Rice Gumm) in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter. The Whaley Firm indicated February 20 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would only work if Mr. Turner could appear there, but Whaley preferred February 26 or 27 at 1:00 PM due to prior commitments on the 24th and 28th. The notes reflect ongoing coordination among the two firms, with attention to Mr. Turner’s availability, location, and the start time of the deposition, and with CC’d clients Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs included in the Filevine project communications.",

On January 28, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Eric S. Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, requesting an update on the deposition schedule for Mr. Turner. The message indicated a need for guidance on dates and availability.\n\nA few days later, on January 31, 2025 at 9:55 a.m., Eric Rice replied to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, cc’ing Brian Stempien and the relevant Filevine contacts for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs. Mr. Rice stated that he had not yet been able to speak with his client.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, at 2:06 p.m., Eric Rice provided a concrete set of potential deposition dates for Mr. Turner, stating that he could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12 or 14, as well as February 18, 19, or 20, if those dates worked. He also noted that the deposition would be held at Rice Gumm, PLLC.\n\nThe following day, February 5, 2025, at 12:00 p.m., Sarena Tuttle, the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Mr. Rice. She indicated that the only date from the proposed options that worked for Whaley’s office was February 20, 2025. She noted that their firm had several mediations and depositions scheduled for that month and asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office. If Mr. Turner were incarcerated, she explained they would need to check with the jail regarding process and availability.\n\nAt 1:50 p.m. on February 5, 2025, Eric Rice responded, confirming that Mr. Turner would be at his office. A few minutes later, at 1:56 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied to confirm and asked Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm would work for him.\n\nBy February 6, 2025, scheduling considerations continued. Krista Rice, Firm Administrator for Rice Gumm, replied at 9:35 a.m. that there was a scheduling conflict for February 20 and proposed alternative dates: February 24, 26, 27, or 28, requesting advice on which of these would work. In a follow-up message at 9:58 a.m., Sarena Tuttle explained that February 24 is a Monday (local motion hour) and February 28 is a Friday (Fayette motion hour), and that Whaley’s office was available on February 26 or 27, but they would need an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m.\n\nLater that same day, February 6, 2025 at 3:25 p.m., Krista Rice sent another note to Sarena Tuttle. She informed that Mr. Turner would not be available until 3:30 p.m. and asked whether any of the following dates would work: March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20, 2025.\n\nContact details associated with these communications are as follows:\n- Krista Rice, Firm Administrator, Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-290-1075; email admin@ricegummlaw.com; website www.ricegummlaw.com.\n- Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (D) 502-357-9971; office line (O) 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address as the “new email address”).\n- Eric S. Rice, Partner, Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-290-1075; email eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com; website www.ricegummlaw.com.\n- W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (and fax) as listed in prior messages; email as per correspondence.\n- Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021: Filevine Project Email Addresses were included as recipients or CCs in the communications.\n\nIn sum, the parties were negotiating a deposition date for Mr. Turner in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter, with initial proposed availability in mid-February at 3:30 p.m. at Rice Gumm, contingent on whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated. The Whaley Law Firm stated February 20 was their workable date, pending concerns about Turner’s location and the jail’s process. When conflicts arose with February 20, alternative dates in late February and late February into March were proposed, with restrictions such as local motion hours on certain days and an agreed start time of 1:00 p.m. for some options. Ultimately, Krista's notice on February 6 indicated Mr. Turner’s availability would be at 3:30 p.m., prompting consideration of March dates (March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20) for scheduling.",

      "natural_language": "In February 2025, the Destiny-Adkins-MVA case (Destiny Adkins, MVA 04/16/2021) moved into deposition scheduling in the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. The Whaley Law Firm, representing Destiny Adkins, was coordinating with Rice Gumm, PLLC, which represented the opposing side. The principal participants in the email chain were Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm; Krista Rice, firm administrator at Rice Gumm; Eric Rice, partner at Rice Gumm; and Brian Stempien and Bryce Koon, among others. The chain also CC’d the Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and for Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021.\n\nThe scheduling discussion began with Eric Rice’s prospective availability. On January 31, 2025, he indicated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on several dates in February (February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20) if those dates could work. He reaffirmed this availability in an email later on February 4, 2025, stating that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12/14, 18, 19, or 20, should those dates be workable.\n\nBy February 5, 2025, the Whaley firm’s Sarena Tuttle responded with constraints from her office. She noted that the only date that worked for their office was February 20, 2025, and that they had several mediations and depositions already scheduled for the month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office, explaining that if the client remained incarcerated they would need to check with the jail for process and availability.\n\nThat same day, in a separate thread, Ms. Tuttle asked Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm would work for him. Earlier, later in that same day, she reaffirmed that February 20 was the only date that worked for her office and again inquired about the incarceration status of Mr. Turner and whether the deposition would be at the defense firm’s office or otherwise, given prison procedures.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Krista Rice conveyed a scheduling conflict for February 20 and proposed alternative dates: February 24, February 26, February 27, or February 28. In response, Sarena Tuttle explained that the 24th is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and the 28th is a Friday reserved for Fayette motion hour. She stated that the office was available on the 26th or 27th but required an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m.\n\nSarena then questioned whether there was a valid reason for Mr. Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m., since the defense had indicated a 3:30 p.m. availability. Krista Rice replied that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m., and the group discussed additional potential dates: March 6, March 12, March 13, March 19, or March 20.\n\nThe chain also shows that the deposition was to involve Mr. Turner appearing at a location arranged with Rice & Gumm, with the question of whether the deposition might instead take place at the jail if the client remained incarcerated. The communications reflect ongoing coordination among the firms, the parties’ clients (Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs), and the Filevine project contacts, as well as the practical scheduling constraints posed by other motions and court hours in February and March 2025.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. The matter at issue is Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al.\n\nIn this cycle of correspondence, the parties discussed scheduling a deposition related to the Destiny Adkins matter. The thread begins with an email from Krista Rice, the Firm Administrator at Rice Gumm, PLLC, to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, dated February 6, 2025 at 4:20 p.m. Krista noted that Mr. Turner was only available starting at 3:30 p.m. and asked Sarena to advise whether any of the proposed dates would work or if additional dates should be provided. Krista’s message included her firm’s contact information and a confidentiality notice, and it was copied to Eric Rice, Bryce Koon, and Brian Stempien.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on February 6, 2025 at 10:29 a.m., Sarena asked Krista whether there was a valid reason for Mr. Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m. (Sarena’s message also listed her title as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and was copied to Eric Rice and other colleagues; it referenced the same case files and Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs.)\n\nOn February 6, 2025 at 10:25 a.m., Krista replied that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m., and she asked whether any of the dates 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, or 3/20 would work.\n\nEarlier still, on February 6, 2025 at 9:58 a.m., Sarena responded that the 24th is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and the 28th is a Friday reserved for Fayette motion hour; they were available on the 26th or 27th but would need an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m.\n\nOn February 6, 2025 at 9:35 a.m., Krista acknowledged the scheduling conflict for 2/20 and asked for confirmation on whether any of the dates 2/24, 2/26, 2/27, or 2/28 would work.\n\nOn February 5, 2025 at 12:00 p.m., Sarena stated that February 20, 2025 would be the only date that worked for The Whaley Law Firm’s office, noting that they had several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice & Gumm’s office, since if the client remained incarcerated they would need to coordinate with the jail about processes and availability.\n\nThat same day, February 5, 2025 at 1:50 p.m., Eric Rice replied, indicating that Mr. Turner would be at Eric Rice’s office.\n\nA short time later, February 5, 2025 at 1:56 p.m., Sarena asked Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm’s office would work.\n\nEarlier still, February 4, 2025 at 2:06 p.m., Eric Rice had written to Bryce that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if any of those dates would work.\n\nAnd on January 31, 2025 at 9:55 a.m., Eric Rice had written to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with others copied, that he had not yet spoken with his client.\n\nIn summary, the parties have been negotiating dates for Mr. Turner’s deposition, with a recurring constraint that Mr. Turner’s availability generally begins at 3:30 p.m.; several alternate dates in February and March were proposed (including 2/20, 2/24, 2/26, 2/27, 2/28, and later dates in March such as 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, and 3/20). The Whaley Law Firm indicated a preference for February 20 unless another arrangement could be made, while Rice Gumm proposed additional options and sought confirmation of availability and location, including whether the deposition would occur at Rice & Gumm’s office or elsewhere. The thread also shows the involvement of multiple recipients and CCs, including Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs, and the matter remains pending regarding a mutually acceptable deposition date and start time.",

      "natural_language": "In February 2025, the Destiny-Adkins-MVA case Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs v. Nail, et al. moved into deposition scheduling for the defendant, Mr Turner. The Whaley Law Firm, representing Destiny Adkins, coordinated with Rice Gumm, PLLC, which represented the other side, to arrange Mr Turner’s deposition in the Adkins & Downs matter (Adkins MVA dated 04/16/2021; Downs MVA dated 04/16/2021).\n\nOn February 5, 2025, at about 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Eric Rice (and others) asking whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr Stempien. The email thread included Destiny Adkins’ and Juanita Downs’ file references in the Filevine project addresses. Eric Rice replied later that Mr Turner would appear at Rice & Gumm’s office. In response, Sarena asked if there was a valid reason for Mr Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 PM, warning that without a valid reason for an appearance at 1:00 PM or sooner, he could be deemed uncooperative and that Whaley Law Firm would be forced to file another motion to compel.\n\nEarlier that same day, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC had indicated a scheduling conflict for February 20 and proposed alternative dates: February 24, February 26, February 27, or February 28. In the subsequent exchanges, the parties discussed start times and availability. Krista’s message noted that Mr Turner would be unavailable on those proposed dates before 3:30 PM, and that they should consider later times or different dates.\n\nThe Whaley firm responded on February 6 with scheduling constraints of their own. Sarena explained that February 24 was the Monday local motion hour and February 28 was Fayette motion hour, so they were available on February 26 or 27 only, but they required an earlier start time of 1:00 PM. Krista replied that Mr Turner was not available until 3:30 PM and asked whether the March dates would work: March 6, March 12, March 13, March 19, or March 20, 2025. Sarena followed up, asking for a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 PM if that time could not be accommodated, reiterating the concern about the start time.\n\nThroughout the exchange, multiple emails carried confidentially notices and standard notices about privileged information. The threads show the following participants and contacts: Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note of a new email address), Krista Rice and Eric Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC (address: 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone: 502-290-1075; email: admin@ricegummlaw.com; website: www.ricegummlaw.com), and other listed participants in the CC line (Bryce Koon, Daniel Gumm, Brian Stempien, and Mr. Stempien’s associated firms). The thread also includes references to the Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA project addresses in Filevine.\n\nIn sum, the parties were actively negotiating deposition timing for Mr Turner, with the Whaley side insisting on a 1:00 PM start time or earlier and warning of a motion to compel if a valid justification for later starts could not be provided. The defense, however, indicated availability only after 3:30 PM, proposing dates in March (the 6th, 12th, 13th, 19th, or 20th) and prompting continued discussion about acceptable times and legitimate reasons for the scheduling constraint.",

Nail, et al.",
      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. The matter involves Destiny Adkins, with the case caption Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. In February 2025, counsel from Rice Gumm, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm conducted an email exchange to schedule the deposition of a witness identified as Def Turner in the matter, with the deposition to be held at Rice Gumm, PLLC.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, in a message to Krista Rice of Rice Gumm and others, asked whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr. Stempien. Eric S. Rice later replied that Mr. Turner “will be here at my office,” indicating he would attend the deposition at Rice Gumm. The thread indicates that Bryce, likely Bryce Koon, could file a motion and explain to the judge that there is no evidence Mr. Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided a sworn answer stating that he was not driving, along with the listed insured and vehicle owner, and that the 3:30 start on the 20th could be justified as workable.\n\nEarlier on February 5, 2025, the parties also discussed alternative scheduling because of a scheduling conflict. Krista Rice stated that there was a scheduling conflict for 2/20 and proposed other dates: 2/24, 2/26, 2/27, or 2/28. On February 6, 2025, Krista again noted that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 and asked whether any of the dates 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, or 3/20 would work. Sarena responded later that day with a reminder to provide a valid reason for the unavailability before 3:30, emphasizing that the deposition should occur during normal business hours and that an hour and a half is not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition; without a valid reason for a 1:00 p.m. or earlier start, Turner could be deemed uncooperative and a motion to compel could be filed.\n\nEarlier messages in the thread show ongoing attempts to find workable dates. Krista had asked if any of the proposed dates would work or if additional dates were needed, and had proposed dates 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, and 3/20. There was also mention that the 24th is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and the 28th is a Friday with Fayette motion hour, with availability on the 26th or 27th but a requirement for a 1:00 p.m. start. Additionally, Krista noted a scheduling conflict for 2/20 and asked for confirmation on other dates.\n\nIn summary, the email chain documents an active scheduling dispute over the deposition of Mr. Turner in Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with proposed dates spanning February 20 (3:30 p.m.), February 24, 26, 27, 28, and March 6, 12, 13, 19, 20, while emphasizing that depositions should occur during normal business hours and that a 1:00 p.m. start is preferred if possible. The exchange also notes the possibility of filing motions to compel if a reasonable start time cannot be arranged. The recipients include Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs (identified in the Filevine project email addresses), and the communications carry standard confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, Destiny Adkins is the client, and the matter at hand is Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. A chain of emails in early February 2025 discusses scheduling a deposition for the matter, with the deposition to be held at opposing counsel’s offices in Louisville, Kentucky. The correspondence involves Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC; Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm; and Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, with Eric Rice and Bryce Koon also copied, and the matter references Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs in connection with the Filevine project addresses listed in the thread.\n\nOn February 6, 2025 at 16:31:06 +0000, Brian Stempien sent an email to Sarena Tuttle and Krista Rice (with Eric Rice and Bryce copied) asking for a citation to the legal requirement that a deponent must be available during “normal business hours.” He noted he hadn’t encountered that requirement before and asked for the citation for future reference. His message concluded with thanks and included his firm’s contact information and a standard Privileged and Confidential disclaimer, along with the firm’s IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure. The email also contained the typical attorney-privilege notice stating that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving the message.\n\nEarlier that morning, at 11:27 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded, questioning the basis for the request. She stated that the issue was not the dates but the start time: the client is obligated to provide the deposition during normal business hours, and she asserted that a one-hour-and-a-half deposition is insufficient for a proper deposition. She warned that without a valid reason why Def Turner could not appear at 1:00 PM or earlier, Turner could be deemed uncooperative and that another motion to compel might be filed.\n\nAlso on February 6, 2025, Krista Rice replied (around 11:20 AM) indicating that they should be advised whether any of the proposed dates work or if additional dates were needed. Krista is identified as the Firm Administrator for Rice Gumm, PLLC, and the message included her updated contact details.\n\nEarlier that same day, at about 10:25 AM, Krista Rice stated that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 PM and asked whether any of the following dates would work: March 6, March 12, March 13, March 19, or March 20. Krista’s message also listed the firm’s contact information and included confidentiality notices.\n\nAt 9:58 AM on February 6, Sarena Tuttle asked whether there was a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 PM. Her inquiry was part of the ongoing scheduling discussion and sought clarification before moving forward.\n\nEven earlier on February 6, 2025, at 9:35 AM, Krista Rice had written that there was a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asked the group to advise which of the alternative dates—February 24, 26, 27, or 28—would work. She noted that February 24 is a Monday designated for local motion hour and February 28 is a Friday Fayette motion hour, which factored into the scheduling considerations. The message included Krista’s firm’s contact information and confidentiality language.\n\nThe thread also includes an earlier exchange on February 5, 2025. In a message sent at 1:56 PM, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged some confirmation and asked whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr. Stempien. The To line shows involvement for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 via Filevine Project Email Addresses, along with other recipients such as Eric Rice, Bryce Koon, and Daniel Gumm, indicating coordination across multiple parties’ counsel and stakeholders.\n\nIn summary, the parties were attempting to schedule the deposition of Def Turner for the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter, with a central dispute over start times and the length of the deposition. The Whaley Law Firm pressed for a 1:00 PM or earlier start, arguing that 90 minutes was insufficient, and suggested availability on February 24, 26, 27, or 28, while Rice Gumm, PLLC indicated Turner was not available before 3:30 PM and proposed alternative dates in March (3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, 3/20). The exchange also touched on the broader question of whether the deposition could be scheduled during “normal business hours,” and included requests for legal citations to that requirement.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. This file concerns Destiny Adkins, the client in the matter captioned Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., related to a motor vehicle accident dated 04/16/2021. The communications summarized here circulated among counsel at Rice Gumm, PLLC (Eric Rice and Bryce Koon), The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena Tuttle and Bryce Koon), and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC (Brian D. Stempien), with the case file references to Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 in the Filevine project.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 at 9:55 AM, Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC wrote to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with copies to Brian Stempien and the Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021, as well as Sarena Tuttle. He stated that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. The message serves as an initial update in the thread regarding deposition scheduling.\n\nA few days later, on February 4, 2025 at 2:06 PM, Eric Rice again replied to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with copies to Brian Stempien, Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021, Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021, and Sarena Tuttle. He advised that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, if any of those dates could work.\n\nOn February 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded to Eric Rice. She noted that the only date that would work for their office was February 20th, and she explained that they already had several mediations and depositions scheduled for that month. She inquired whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice & Gumm’s office; if Mr. Turner remained incarcerated, they would need to check with the jail for their process and availability.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 1:50 PM on February 5, 2025, Eric Rice replied to Bryce Koon (and others) with a brief statement: “He’ll be here at my office.” This indicated that the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm, PLLC’s office, pending the discussed date.\n\nAt 1:56 PM on February 5, 2025, Sarena Tuttle followed up, asking Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him. This reiterated the preference for a February 20th date at Rice & Gumm and moved the scheduling decision closer to a final confirmation.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on February 6, 2025 at 9:35 AM, Krista Rice, the Firm Administrator for Rice Gumm, responded to the group. She apologized for a scheduling conflict on February 20 and proposed alternative dates: February 24, February 26, February 27, or February 28.\n\nLater the same day, February 6, 2025 at 4:33 PM (UTC), Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC replied. He stated that they should be able to accommodate any day and asked to be advised once the parties hammered out the date. He provided his firm’s contact information: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1 (866) 431-3599; bstempien@thattorneys.com; Website: http://www.thslaw.co. The email also included the standard Privileged and Confidential Notice, which asserts attorney-privilege and confidentiality unless otherwise indicated, and states that no attorney-client relationship is created by email; it also includes the IRS Circular 230 tax advice warning, noting that the document may not contain all required tax disclosures and that one may not rely on any tax advice here to avoid penalties or use any portion in marketing.\n\nThroughout this exchange, the parties repeatedly identified the case as Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs noted as MVA clients dated 04/16/2021, and the Filevine project email addresses included in the communications.\n\nIn summary, the thread documents a concerted effort to schedule a deposition related to Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with Mr. Turner identified as the client on the other side. The proposed dates circulated included February 12, 14, 18, 19, and 20 for a 3:30 PM deposition at Rice Gumm, with February 20 being the only date initially workable for The Whaley Law Firm, and a later counterproposal from Rice Gumm noting conflicts on February 20 and suggesting alternatives of February 24, 26, 27, or 28. The parties debated location (at Rice Gumm’s office versus another venue) and whether the client would be incarcerated, all within a framework of standard legal confidentiality and tax-disclosure notices. The chain ends with Brian Stempien’s message that any date would be workable once hammering out a final date, effectively placing scheduling in the hands of the other firms to confirm a mutually agreeable deposition date.",

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins is the client in the matter labeled Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, and the case at issue is Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. A scheduling conversation among counsel in February 2025 concerned taking the deposition of a defendant named Turner in this case. The email chain includes participants from two Louisville law firms: Rice Gumm, PLLC, and The Whaley Law Firm, along with Brian Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC. The correspondence reveals a dispute over when Turner could be deposed and how long the deposition should last, with repeated references to the need for a normal business-hours start time.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC asked whether proposed deposition dates would work, listing options of February 24, 26, 27, or 28. She noted a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asked for guidance on which dates might be workable. Earlier that same morning, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Krista, stating that the 24th—a Monday—was reserved for local motion hour and the 28th—a Friday—was Fayette motion hour, and that they were available only on the 26th or 27th, with a required start time of 1:00 p.m. She emphasized that an earlier start would be necessary and warned that Turner’s unavailability at that time could be interpreted as uncooperative, potentially leading to another motion to compel.\n\nKrista responded later that day, confirming the scheduling need and asking whether any of the proposed dates would work or if additional options were needed. A separate note from Krista then stated that Mr. Turner would not be available until 3:30 p.m. and asked whether dates such as March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20 would work. In response, Sarena questioned whether there was a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 p.m., reiterating the concern about the start time and the need for Turner to appear during normal business hours.\n\nKrista followed up again, asking for confirmation that any of the proposed dates would work or whether more options were needed. Sarena pressed for the reason behind Turner’s late-hour availability, reiterating that the issue was not the dates themselves but the start time, and warning that Turner could be deemed uncooperative without a valid reason for a 1:00 p.m. or earlier start. Eric Rice then weighed in, suggesting that Bryce could file a motion and that they could inform the judge that there was no evidence Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided a sworn response stating he was not driving, alongside the listed insured and vehicle owner. Eric added that it would also be appropriate to explain why 3:30 p.m. could work for the 20th, noting that this should not be a difficult matter.\n\nSeparately, on March 4, 2025, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC sent an email asking, “Did you guys get a date for this depo?” He provided the table of the case details and listed contact information for himself and colleagues, including his office in Louisville, KY, and the firm’s website. The message bore the standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality notices common to law firms, including disclaimers that sending an email does not establish an attorney-client relationship and that the content is intended for the named recipient. The email also referenced IRS Circular 230 disclosures for any tax-related content.\n\nIn short, the February 2025 emails show opposing counsel negotiating deposition dates for Turner, with Whaley Law Firm seeking to start at 1:00 p.m. due to court-motion hours on certain days, while Rice Gumm, PLLC proposed later start times (3:30 p.m. or later) and suggested alternative dates in March. The discussions repeatedly centered on whether Turner could be deposed during normal business hours and whether a shorter deposition duration (an hour and a half) would be sufficient. The participants debated the need for a valid reason if Turner could not start by 1:00 p.m., and there was a suggestion that a motion to compel could be filed if cooperation could not be achieved. By early March, counsel were still working toward obtaining a suitable deposition date, with Brian Stempien following up on whether a date had been set.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021. Client: Destiny Adkins. This matter concerns Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al.\n\nIn this matter, a deposition was being scheduled for a person referred to as Turner. As of March 4, 2025, the deposition had not yet been scheduled. In an email from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, she informed Brian Stempien that Bryce was in a deposition out of town that day and that she would follow up with him upon his return later that afternoon. The message also noted Sarena’s contact details and her new email address.\n\nEarlier email traffic, beginning in February 2025, revolved around scheduling that same deposition. On February 6, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC wrote that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m. and asked whether any of the dates 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, or 3/20 would work. In response, Sarena Tuttle asked for a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 p.m., explaining that start time is the issue and that an hour and a half is not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition; she warned that without a valid reason Turner could be considered uncooperative and that a motion to compel might be forthcoming. Krista Rice followed up, asking to confirm whether any of the proposed dates would work or if additional dates were needed.\n\nThe thread also included additional correspondence from Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC. In a February 6, 2025 email, Eric advised Bryce that a motion could be filed and argued to the judge that there is no evidence Turner was driving, noting that Turner had already provided a sworn statement that he was not driving, along with the listed insured and the vehicle owner. He also suggested explaining why 3:30 p.m. on the 20th would be acceptable, framing it as not a difficult issue.\n\nThroughout the exchanges, standard confidentiality and privilege notices appeared in the email signatures. For example, there were disclaimers stating that the information was attorney-privileged and confidential, that no attorney‑client relationship was created by sending or receiving the email, and that tax-related disclaimers under IRS Circular 230 applied to any tax-advice content. The signatures also reiterated that viewing, copying, disclosure, or distribution could be restricted, and they provided contact information for the parties involved.\n\nIn sum, by early February 2025 the parties were negotiating deposition dates for Turner, with Turner said to be unavailable before 3:30 p.m. on dates including March 6, 12, 13, 19, and 20. The discussion included whether to proceed with a motion to compel and how to justify a 3:30 start time, with particular emphasis on the possibility that the 3:30 time on the 20th could work.

      "natural_language": "Destiny Adkins’ file, Destiny-Adkins-MVA-04-16-2021, concerns the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter. The deposition in question is for Demetrius Turner. On March 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent counsel a notice stating that the office would take the deposition of Demetrius Turner on April 17, 2025, at 12:00 p.m., to be held at Turner’s attorney of record, Rice Gumm PLLC. The email notes that the deposition notice is attached and invites any questions to be discussed directly. Tuttle’s signature identifies her role, provides her contact information (D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and notes “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.” The Whaley Law Firm is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.\n\nEarlier within the same chain, on March 4, 2025, Tuttle informed Brian Stempien that the deposition had not yet been scheduled; she explained that Bryce was in a deposition out of town that day and that she would follow up with him upon his return later that afternoon. A subsequent message from Stempien on March 4, 2025 asked whether a date had been set for the deposition, providing his firm’s office and contact information.\n\nThe scheduling discussions stretch back to February 2025 and involved multiple participants from both sides, including Krista Rice of Rice Gumm PLLC and Eric Rice, with input from Stempien. On February 6, 2025, Krista Rice asked whether any of the proposed dates would work or if additional information was needed. In response, Sarena Tuttle indicated that the issue was not the dates but the start time, explaining that the deposition should occur during normal business hours and that an hour and a half was not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition. She asked for a valid reason if Demetrius Turner could not appear at 1:00 p.m. or earlier, warning that failure to do so could render him uncooperative and might prompt another motion to compel.\n\nIn an email dated February 6, 2025, Eric S. Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC) advised that Bryce could file a motion and argued that there was no evidence Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided a sworn statement indicating he was not driving, along with the listed insured and vehicle owner. He suggested explaining why a 3:30 p.m. start had been chosen for the 20th. This message, like others from Eric Rice, contains the customary confidentiality and privilege notices, including a disclaimer that no attorney–client relationship is created by sending or receiving emails, along with the standard IRS Circular 230 warnings about tax disclosures contained in such communications.\n\nThroughout the exchange, the parties circulated a mix of proposed dates and times, with one reference to a start time of 3:30 p.m. being discussed for the 20th, and with ongoing questions about Turner’s availability and the length of the deposition. The March 5, 2025 email ultimately announces a formal deposition notice for Demetrius Turner set for April 17, 2025 at 12:00 p.m. at Rice Gumm PLLC, with the Notice attached and the option to contact The Whaley Law Firm directly with any questions.\n\nRegarding the supporting contact information and affiliations: The Whaley Law Firm’s address is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and main office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; Sarena M. Tuttle’s email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting it as the new address). Rice Gumm PLLC is listed with offices at 12804 Townepark Way, Suite 200, Louisville, KY 40243; Eric Rice can be reached at (502) 290-1075 (eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com). The deposition notice on March 5, 2025, states the deposition will be held at Rice Gumm PLLC, and the matter was captioned under Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. The chain also includes the standard confidentiality and privilege disclaimers typical of communications among counsel.",

The categorized totals are Litigation 211, Investigation 23, Lien 11, Expenses 7, Medical Records 7, Client 3, and Insurance 2. All files were renamed to follow the convention: YYYY-MM-DD - Client - Category - Originator - Description. \n\nThere are 39 files remaining in the root that require manual review. This set includes 17 hash-named .md files that have not been processed, 20 .eml files representing litigation correspondence, and 6 .doc files in an unreadable binary format that will need conversion to PDF.\n\nIn the quality review, the error rate was 5.6% (7 out of 125 files). Corrections included fixing date errors, recategorizing one police report, and removing one wrong case file (dated 05/01/2021) that pertained to a different incident than the 04/16/2021 case.\n\nCase insights reveal a complex multi-party matter with co-plaintiff Juanita Downs. Defendants include Stephanie Nail (vehicle owner), Demetrius Turner (driver who fled the scene), and Allstate Insurance. A bad faith claim against Allstate has been bifurcated and placed in abeyance. Turner has an extensive criminal history and was difficult to locate for deposition. The vehicle was reported stolen after the accident (not before), which led to an initial denial of coverage by Allstate. There are active discovery disputes with Turner’s counsel, Rice Gumm PLLC, concerning deposition scheduling and overdue discovery responses, which exceed 60 days overdue as of November 1, 2024.\n\nThere are four files that require attorney review due to unclear or future dates, requiring verification from CourtNet or the client.\n\nAll reports have been saved to the Reports/ folder.
