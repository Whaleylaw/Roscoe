      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. This matter concerns Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction.\n\nIn February 2022, communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates regarding Form 106 and related administration in the estate. On February 7, 2022, Angie Burns, a Paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates (600 East Main Street, Suite 100, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-736-3600; fax 502-736-3606; aburns@umakylaw.com), emailed agwhaley@louisville-accident-lawyer.com noting that the firm had not yet received a Form 106 for the claim identified as LA 2075 and requesting that it be forwarded at the earliest convenience.\n\nOn February 17, 2022, Angie Burns followed up again with a request for the Form 106 in the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction matter. That message was forwarded within the chain, with Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022; email sarena@whaleylawfirm.com; please note new email address) involved in the discussion.\n\nOn February 18, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded to Angie Burns, stating that the Form 106 for Estate of Keith Graser was attached and that the Form had been executed by the Administratrix, Nancy Graser. The message indicated that if anything else was needed, Angie's office should feel free to contact The Whaley Law Firm to discuss it further.\n\nLater, on February 21, 2022, at 3:32 p.m. (15:32:59 -0500), Sarena sent another email noting that she was enclosing the order appointing Nancy Graser Administratrix. She also stated that, at that time, The Whaley Law Firm did not have a copy of Keith Graser\u2019s death certificate on file and that she had reached out to Nancy to obtain a copy for the office as soon as possible. The email concluded with Sarena\u2019s sign-off and contact details, including the instruction to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nThat same day, the recipient, Angie Burns, replied at 2:16 p.m., thanking The Whaley Law Firm for the Form 106 but indicating a need for two additional items: (1) the copy of the Order appointing the Administratrix (Administratrix as spelled in the notice) and (2) a copy of the death certificate.\n\nIn the chain, the following signature blocks and contact details appeared: Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with the office address and numbers listed above, and a note to contact directly if more information was needed; Nancy Graser was referenced as the Administratrix in the documents; and the correspondence repeatedly included the subject line Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction. The exchange also contains the earlier communications showing the file designation \u201cOur File: LA 2075\u201d and the repeated request for Form 106 and the missing death certificate, along with the request for the order appointing the Administratrix.",

Coupe Construction, UMA File DAU/REN LA 2075.\n\nThe exchange began with an email chain regarding scheduling Nancy Graser\u2019s deposition. On April 25, 2022, Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, wrote to Aaron Whaley requesting to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition. Doug U\u2019Sellis would like the deposition to be held in person, and they are willing to travel to Aaron\u2019s office if preferred. Jessica listed several available dates: May 9, May 13, May 18, May 19, May 20, and May 23, 2022, with start times of either 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. Eastern. She asked for confirmation of what would work for Aaron and Ms. Graser.\n\nThe email thread shows the scheduling discussion continuing, with Aaron Whaley forwarding the message and the corresponding reply being circulated in the chain. In the body of the April 25 correspondence, Jessica reiterated the dates and flexibility, inviting a firm to indicate which dates and times would work for all parties.\n\nLater on April 25, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded to Jessica: Mrs. Graser is available at 2:00 p.m. on May 18, 2022 for her deposition, and they are willing to come to Jessica\u2019s location. Sarena provided her firm\u2019s contact information and noted the new email address for future correspondence: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and direct lines D: (502) 365-9435 and O: (502) 583-4022.\n\nOn April 27, 2022 at 11:42 a.m., Jessica replied, thanking Sarena and stating that she had attached the deposition notice, asking Sarena to confirm receipt of the notice. Later that same day, at 12:29 p.m., Sarena replied to confirm receipt of the notice and again expressed thanks to Jessica. Sarena\u2019s signature block reiterates the firm\u2019s contact details and reminds the reader to note the new email address.\n\nFor completeness, the communications reference the relevant case details: the Estate of Keith Graser is the client, the matter is Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, and the UMA file is DAU/REN LA 2075. The deposition is identified as the deposition of Nancy Graser in this matter, with the stated availability of 2:00 p.m. on May 18, 2022, and the parties\u2019 mutual willingness to conduct the deposition in person at a location convenient to the parties.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. The matter is titled Estate of Keith Graser v Coupe Construction.\n\nIn the email thread related to the Estate of Keith Graser v Coupe Construction, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an initial correspondence to Doug U\u2019Sellis of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, with Aaron Whaley and Rick Neal of The Whaley Law Firm CC\u2019d. The thread shows communications occurring in May 2022. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details are listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 365-9435; office line (502) 583-4022; and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, at 4:13 PM, Doug U\u2019Sellis wrote to Aaron and Sarena. He reported that Ms. Graser had testified that her husband\u2019s pulmonary specialist was a doctor referred to as \u201cDr. Windsor,\u201d but the law firm could not locate any pulmonologist by that name. He asked that Aaron and Sarena check with the widow to confirm the correct name and, if possible, to determine where the doctor was located or which practice he or she was affiliated with. Doug signed as Douglas A. U\u2019Sellis of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, located at 600 East Main Street, Suite 100, Louisville, KY 40202. His phone number was (502) 736-3600, with fax (502) 736-3606, and the website www.umakylaw.com. His email was dusellis@umakylaw.com. The email also included a note indicating the message was created using voice recognition software and advising to reply to the sender or call the listed number with any questions.\n\nThe following day, May 27, 2022, at 9:35 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Mr. U\u2019Sellis. She stated that she had reached out to Nancy but had to leave Nancy a voicemail and was awaiting a callback. In the meantime, she would review the documents on hand to locate the requested information. This message again carried Sarena\u2019s signature for The Whaley Law Firm, with the same address and contact numbers as noted above, and the reminder that her email address is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, labeled \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nLater that same day (and continuing the thread), a prior message from May 26 is reflected in the correspondence, where Sarena\u2019s earlier note included her name, firm, and contact information, reiterating that she would be checking the documents to locate the required information and that she had left a voicemail for Nancy.\n\nSeparately, in the body of the May 26 exchange, the subject of the inquiry concerned the identity and location of the husband\u2019s pulmonary specialist. Doug had asked the recipients to confirm the correct doctor\u2019s name and, if necessary, to determine where the doctor practiced. The thread as a whole centers on confirming the correct physician\u2019s name for the deceased\u2019s spouse and locating the doctor\u2019s practice information, with Nancy providing clarification that the correct physician is Dr. David Winslow, not Windsor. Nancy\u2019s correction identifies Dr. David Winslow as the pulmonary specialist, and provides the office location at 3430 Newburg Road and the phone number (502) 559-5864.\n\nIn summary: the case concerns the Estate of Keith Graser in a matter against Coupe Construction. A disagreement over the correct pulmonologist\u2019s name occurred, with initial reports citing Dr. Windsor. Doug requested verification and location details for the doctor. Sarena later reported that Nancy had clarified the physician\u2019s name as Dr. David Winslow, not Windsor, and provided the office address (3430 Newburg Road) and phone number (502) 559-5864. Sarena indicated she would continue to pursue the information and invited any further contact if more details were needed. The communications were between The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle) and U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates (Douglas A. U\u2019Sellis), with CC\u2019d colleagues Aaron Whaley and Rick Neal on the Whaley firm\u2019s side.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, with the client listed as the Estate of Keith Graser, there was a sequence of LMS Claim Document notifications concerning the claim identified as 202200007. The notification noted that the document related to the Medical Report of Dr. Daniel Wolens had been filed for the claim of KEITH BRYAN GRASER on December 12, 2022, and directed the recipients to refer to the LMS system at https://kyworkersclaims.lms.ky.gov/ for more information. The message indicated that the email should not be replied to and was sent by Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with contact numbers 502-583-4022 and 502-583-4022 ext 104, and his email address listed as agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nThe initial email regarding the LMS Claim Document Notification was sent on December 13, 2022 at 13:51:00 -0500 from Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Aaron Whaley. In that email, Sarena stated that the report did not specifically list any employees; it merely described \u201c1 or 2 co-workers\u201d and included a list of companies Keith visited: Paul\u2019s Fruit Market, Brooklawn Kitchen, Georgetown ES Windows, and Clariant Doors. She added that the material seemed to redirect to Keith\u2019s dental appointment more than anything, and she speculated it might involve dental employees.\n\nIn a follow-up message dated December 13, 2022 at 1:36 PM, Sarena asked a clarifying question: \u201cWhich employees? The hospital, his work or all people he came into contact with?\u201d The signature block for Sarena M. Tuttle then appeared again, providing her title, the Whaley Law Firm address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and email (E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nEarlier, on December 12, 2022 at 5:01 PM, Aaron Whaley replied with: \u201cI want to depose every employee mentioned in this report.\u201d This exchange occurred after a forwarded message describing the LMS Claim Document Notification, which stated that a document had been filed and that the Medical Report of Dr. Daniel Wolens was associated with the claim number 202200007 for the claimant KEITH BRYAN GRASER, filed on 12/12/2022, with a direct link to LMS for more information and a directive not to reply to the email.\n\nThe forwarded content included the initial LMS notification: a document had been filed on December 12, 2022, with the Document Name: MEDICAL REPORT OF: DR. DANIEL WOLENS; Claim Numbers: 202200007; Claimants: KEITH BRYAN GRASER; Date Filed: 12/12/2022. It directed recipients to refer to the LMS claim at https://kyworkersclaims.lms.ky.gov/ for more information and reiterated not to reply to the email. The message was signed by Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the contact number 502-583-4022. The forwarded message also included the original header indicating it came from an unknown sender on December 12, 2022 at 4:37 PM, with the subject LMS Claim Document Notification, and summarized the same claim details.",

      "natural_language": "In the case titled Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, involving the Estate of Keith Graser as the client, the matter of Keith Graser v Coup Construction concerns scheduling witness depositions for lay witnesses. The communications trace a sequence of emails about identifying witnesses, confirming dates, and obtaining full names from the defendant\u2019s side for investigative purposes and deposition planning.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Mr. U\u2019Sellis, Doug U\u2019Sellis, Rick Neal, and Angie Burns, with Aaron Whaley copied, regarding the deposition scheduling. She thanked them for filing the Report of Dr. Daniel Wolens. In Dr. Wolens\u2019 report, several Coup Construction employees were listed as having had contact with Mr. Graser during the latency period of his illness, but the employees were not fully identified\u2014only their initials were provided. She requested the disclosure of the full legal names of each listed Coup Construction employee identified in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report for investigative purposes up to and including the intent to schedule the depositions of each said employee.\n\nA little over a week later, on December 22, 2022 at 1:15 PM, Rick Neal replied to Sarena, listing potential witnesses: Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke. He stated that he planned to schedule the depositions of the first three individuals, and that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant. He added that they would get with her regarding scheduling, but it probably wouldn\u2019t be until after the holidays. His signature identified him as Richard E. Neal of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, located at 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207, with a phone number of (502) 736-3600 and a fax number of (502) 736-3606, and included a standard firm tagline about providing Workers Compensation defense in Kentucky and Indiana since 2002. The email also carried a notice that it was created using voice recognition software, with the line: \u201cThis email was created using voice recognition software. If you have any questions, Reply to sender or call (502) 736-3600.\u201d\n\nEarlier that same day, at 1:23 PM, Sarena responded to Rick, expressing appreciation and stating that they looked forward to reviewing the dates for availability. She noted that they were pretty open the month of February. Her signature block identified her as Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address, and listed both a direct line (D) and main line (O), along with her email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and the note \"(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\"\n\nAlso on December 22, 2022 at 1:34 PM, Angie Burns sent a brief forward or FYI message to Jessica Wiedersatz, though the exact contents beyond \u201cFYI \u2026\u201d were not expanded in the record.\n\nEarlier still, at 1:15 PM on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal had written to Sarena with the same witness list and scheduling intent cited above, reinforcing that depositions would focus on the first three witnesses and noting again that Nick Smoke was no longer with the defendant; he concluded by saying they would coordinate scheduling after the holidays.\n\nOn December 28, 2022, at 1:26 PM, Jessica Wiedersatz sent Rick Neal a message: \u201cRick, Please let me know when you are ready for me to look into dates, etc.\u201d Rick replied at 1:44 PM: \u201cYou can go ahead at this point. Thanks.\u201d The signatures for these messages identified Rick Neal as with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates at the same Louisville address, and Jessica Wiedersatz as the sender.\n\nFinally, on January 10, 2023, at 15:40:39 UTC, Jessica Wiedersatz wrote to Sarena, asking for a concrete February date for the lay witness depositions. She stated that providing the witnesses with a specific date would be the easiest way to pin down scheduling, and she asked Sarena to let her know what dates were available.\n\nAll of these communications are part of the ongoing exchange among The Whaley Law Firm and U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates regarding Keith Graser v Coup Construction, specifically focused on identifying and scheduling depositions for lay witnesses, with February identified as a likely window and with attention to the status of potential witnesses (notably that Nick Smoke is no longer with the defendant). The record also reflects the need to obtain the full legal names of Coup Construction employees listed in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report for further investigative or scheduling purposes. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details are listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct and main phone lines, and the firm\u2019s email address for Sarena Tuttle noted as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (new email address). The opposing firm, U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, is based at 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207.",

On December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Doug U\u2019Sellis and Rick Neal (with Aaron Whaley cc\u2019d) requesting that Coup Construction disclose the full legal names of the employees referenced in Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report. The purpose was to facilitate further investigative steps and the potential scheduling of depositions. Tuttle closed with her contact information\nCase: Estate of Keith Graser, WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. Re: Keith Graser v. Coup Construction \u2014 Witness Deposition Scheduling.\n\nThe communications in this matter began in December 2022 as the firms coordinated the scheduling of lay witness depositions and identified potential witnesses. On December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; telephone numbers and her new email address noted) sent an email to Doug U\u2019Sellis and Rick Neal, with Aaron Whaley cc\u2019d, requesting that Coup Construction disclose the full legal names of the employees listed in Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report. She stated that the information was needed for investigative purposes and to support the intent to schedule depositions of those employees.\n\nA little over a week later, on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates replied, listing potential witnesses: Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke, noting that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant and that his deposition would not be pursued. Neal said he planned to schedule depositions for the first three individuals and indicated that scheduling would likely occur after the holidays. This message was followed by a December 22, 2022 reply from Sarena Tuttle thanking Neal and stating that the firm was \u201cpretty open the month of February\u201d and would review dates for availability.\n\nAlso on December 22, 2022, Angie Burns forwarded the exchange with an \u201cFYI\u201d note. Earlier that day, Sarena\u2019s message to Rick Neal had reiterated the request for full employee identifications from Coup Construction to aid in the investigation and potential deposition planning. In response to the December 22 thread, Rick Neal had provided the list of witnesses and the plan to schedule the depositions after the holidays, and Sarena confirmed February as the open window for scheduling.\n\nOn December 28, 2022, Jessica Wiedersatz followed up, asking Rick Neal to let her know when he was ready for her to start looking into dates. Neal replied later that day that she could proceed. He reiterated his earlier list and the plan to schedule depositions after the holidays.\n\nIn early January 2023, Jessica Wiedersatz asked again for a concrete February date that Mr. Whaley had open for the lay witness depositions, explaining that providing a specific date to the witnesses would simplify the process. She requested that Neal share what dates were available.\n\nResponding on January 10, 2023, Sarena Tuttle indicated that they were pretty open in February and could schedule depositions on any afternoon during the weeks of February 13 and February 20. She provided her contact details again and reminded that the new email address should be used for future correspondence.\n\nThroughout, the case involved the Estate of Keith Graser as the client and the litigation against Coup Construction, with a focus on scheduling witness depositions and identifying the Coup Construction employees referenced in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report.",

Re: Keith Graser v Coup Construction \u2013 Witness Deposition Scheduling.\n\nThe communications center on scheduling lay witness depositions in the Keith Graser v. Coup Construction matter. On December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (addressed to Doug U\u2019Sellis, Rick Neal, and Angie Burns, with Aaron Whaley CC\u2019d) requested that the full legal names of each Coup Construction employee listed in Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report be disclosed. In that report, several employees were noted only by initials, and the request was made to obtain their full names for investigative purposes up to scheduling depositions of each employee.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Rick Neal of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates responded that potential witnesses included Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke. He stated that depositions would be scheduled for the first three, and that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant. He indicated that scheduling would be coordinated with Sarena and that it would likely occur after the holidays. Rick Neal\u2019s message included his contact information and his firm\u2019s boilerplate about providing workers\u2019 compensation defense since 2002.\n\nLater on December 22, 2022, Sarena Tuttle replied that they were pretty open for February and looked forward to reviewing dates for availability. Her reply, which included her firm\u2019s contact details and note of her new email address, followed Rick\u2019s initial note. Earlier that same day, December 22, 2022 at 1:15 PM, Rick Neal had written again with the preliminary witness list and scheduling expectations.\n\nOn December 28, 2022, Jessica Wiedersatz asked Rick Neal to let her know when he was ready for her to look into dates. Rick answered at 1:44 PM, telling her to go ahead. Jessica had previously asked on December 28, 2022 at 1:26 PM to be informed when dates were ready.\n\nMoving into January 2023, Jessica Wiedersatz asked on January 10 at 10:40 AM for a date that Mr. Whaley had open in February for these lay witness depositions, noting that providing a specific date to the witnesses would be easiest. She requested whatever availability Rick\u2019s side had. Sarena Tuttle responded later that day, January 10, 2023 at 3:44 PM, saying they were pretty open in February and that they could do any afternoon during the weeks of February 13 and February 20.\n\nFinally, on January 11, 2023 at 3:43 PM, Jessica Wiedersatz replied that she was aiming for February 13 at 2:00 PM, that she had already emailed the witness to confirm whether that time would work, and that she would follow up as soon as she heard back.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nIn the matter of Keith Graser v. Coup Construction, the estate\u2019s representation\u2014The Whaley Law Firm\u2014began coordinating witness depositions related to the case, designated as Witness Deposition Scheduling. The correspondence spans December 2022 to January 2023 and centers on scheduling lay-witness depositions and identifying the witnesses and potential dates.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, representing the Estate of Keith Graser, emailed Doug U\u2019Sellis, Rick Neal, and Angie Burns, with Aaron Whaley cc\u2019d, to acknowledge the filing of Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report. In that report, Wolens listed several Coup Construction employees with whom Mr. Graser had or could have had contact during the latency period of his illness; however, the employees were identified only by initials. Sarena requested the full legal names of each listed Coup Construction employee referenced in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report for investigative purposes and to enable scheduling depositions of each named employee.\n\nOn December 22, 2022, Sarena replied to Rick Neal stating that they were open to scheduling in February and looked forward to reviewing dates for availability. She noted that February would work well for them.\n\nEarlier on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal had indicated in a separate message to Sarena that potential witnesses included Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke. He planned to schedule depositions for the first three individuals listed, noting that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant. He also suggested that scheduling would likely occur after the holidays.\n\nThat same day, December 22, 2022, Rick Neal\u2019s message was followed by a note in the thread from Jessica Wiedersatz asking Rick to let her know when he was ready for her to look into dates and to provide a specific date to the witnesses.\n\nOn December 28, 2022, Jessica Wiedersatz again reached out to Rick Neal asking to be advised when she could start looking into deposition dates. In response, Rick Neal replied, \u201cYou can go ahead at this point. Thanks.\u201d This affirmed permission to proceed with scheduling.\n\nThe thread continued into January 2023. On January 10, 2023, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Jessica Wiedersatz, stating that they were pretty open in February and could do any afternoon during the weeks of February 13 and February 20.\n\nThe following day, January 11, 2023, Jessica replied that she was aiming for February 13 at 2:00 PM and had sent an email to the witness to confirm that time, promising to respond as soon as she heard back.\n\nLater on January 11, 2023, at 10:56 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Jessica, thanking her for the update and asking for clarification on whether the February 13 date scheduling would cover all three witnesses or just one. In her signature, she again listed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and reminded that the email address provided was a new one (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com).\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discussed open February availability, potential witnesses (including Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke, with Nick Smoke noted as no longer with the defendant), the need to identify full names of Coup Construction employees referenced in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report, and the goal of scheduling deposition dates for lay witnesses in the Keith Graser case.",

In Dr. Wolens' report he listed several employees in which Mr. Graser had or could have had contact during the latency period of his illness. Unfortunately, these employees are not fully identified, only their initials are noted.\n Please disclose the full legal name of each listed Coup Construction employee noted in Dr. Wolens' report for further investigative purposes up to and including the intent to schedule the depositions of each said employee.\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser (Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020), the client is the Estate of Keith Graser. The case involved scheduling depositions of lay witnesses in the Keith Graser v Coup Construction matter. The deposition-scheduling discussions unfolded through a chain of emails beginning in December 2022 and continuing into January 2023, involving Jessica Wiedersatz (UmaKy Law), Sarena Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), and Rick Neal (U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates).\n\nThe thread began on December 13, 2022, when Sarena Tuttle sent a request to Doug U\u2019Sellis, Rick Neal, and Angie Burns (cc\u2019ing Aaron Whaley). She asked for the full legal names of each Coup Construction employee listed in Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report because the report identified several employees who had contact with Mr. Graser during the latency period of his illness, but only by initials. The goal was to enable further investigative work and to determine the depositions of each mentioned employee.\n\nA week later, on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal listed potential witnesses as Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke. He indicated he planned to schedule depositions for the first three witnesses, noting that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant. He also signaled that scheduling would likely occur after the holidays. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle replied that they were open in February and could accommodate any afternoon during the weeks of February 13 or February 20. The Whaley Law Firm's contact details were provided (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), and it was emphasized that this was a new email address.\n\nMeanwhile, on December 28, 2022, Jessica Wiedersatz asked Rick Neal to let her know when he was ready for her to look into dates. Rick had previously indicated readiness to move forward, and Jessica\u2019s message suggested she would begin searching for dates once he confirmed. Angie Burns forwarded a note on December 22, 2022, as a courtesy, and Rick\u2019s earlier message on December 22 to Sarena indicated a plan to review dates for February availability, with Sarena reiterating the February window.\n\nThat month\u2019s exchanges continued into late December and early January. On December 28, 2022, Rick Neal replied, \u201cYou can go ahead at this point. Thanks.\u201d Jessica followed up again on December 28, 2022, asking to be informed when she should start looking into dates. In separate threads, Angie Burns and Rick Neal kept communications going, with Rick indicating that the depositions would be scheduled after the holidays.\n\nAs January 2023 began, Jessica asked for concrete February availability, stating she needed a date for the lay witness depositions. Sarena replied on January 10, 2023, that they were pretty open in February and could do any afternoon during the weeks of February 13 or February 20. Jessica responded on January 10, 2023, at 10:43 AM, expressing that she was aiming for February 13 at 2:00 PM and had already reached out to the witnesses to see if that time would work, promising to revert once she heard back. Sarena followed up on January 11, 2023, at 10:56 AM to clarify whether the proposed date and time would cover all three witnesses or just one, asking to be kept posted. Jessica replied later that day, stating she was aiming for February 13 at 2:00 PM for all three witnesses and that she had contacted the witnesses to confirm; she would provide an update as soon as she heard back.\n\nFinally, on January 12, 2023, at 18:41:06 (UTC), Jessica reiterated the plan to take all three depositions\u2014Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, and Jason Jackman\u2014on February 13, beginning at 2:00 PM. Throughout the thread, the exchanges referenced the depositions of the three witnesses, with Nick Smoke noted as no longer with the defendant, and the depositions were planned for lay witnesses in February, pending witness confirmation. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s communications continued to reflect the firm\u2019s contact details and the note that Sarena\u2019s email address had changed to sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The correspondence includes standard closing lines emphasizing the ongoing coordination for scheduling these depositions in this workers\u2019 compensation defense matter.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, with the client being the Estate of Keith Graser, the matter concerned Keith Graser v Coup Construction and the scheduling of witness depositions.

Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding the timing and scope of the depositions.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Doug U\u2019Sellis, Rick Neal, and Angie Burns (with Aaron Whaley copied) requesting the full legal names of each Coup Construction employee listed in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report for investigative purposes, up to and including the deposition of each such employee. The Dr. Wolens report had identified several employees, but only by initials.\n\nLater that same month, on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal informed Jessica Wiedersatz that potential witnesses included Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke, noting that he planned to schedule depositions of the first three individuals listed and that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant.

Rick responded, \u201cYou can go ahead at this point. Thanks,\u201d and Jessica followed up accordingly. Rick\u2019s reply and Jessica\u2019s follow-up were part of the ongoing planning.\n\nEarlier, on January 10, 2023, Jessica asked Sarena to provide a date that Mr. Whaley had open in February for the lay witness depositions, noting that providing a specific date to the witnesses would simplify the process. Jessica requested what dates were available.\n\nOn January 11, 2023, Sarena replied that they were pretty open in February and asked Jessica to keep them posted about whether the request was for all three witnesses or just one.

She also stated that she had sent an email to the witnesses to confirm their availability and would get back to Sarena as soon as she heard back. Sarena replied shortly after, \u201cAwesome.

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser, case number WC-12-07-2020, the client is the Estate of Keith Graser. The matter concerned scheduling witness depositions in the Keith Graser v Coup Construction dispute. The correspondence spans December 2022 through January 2023 and centers on arranging depositions of lay witnesses identified as potential employer witnesses.\n\nOn December 13, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a request to disclose the full legal names of each Coup Construction employee listed in Dr. Daniel Wolens\u2019 report. In the report, the employees were only identified by initials, and Sarena requested their full names for investigative purposes and future scheduling of the depositions.\n\nA week later, on December 22, 2022, Rick Neal of UMAKYLaw replied that potential witnesses included Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, and Nick Smoke, noting that Nick Smoke was apparently no longer with the defendant. He stated an intention to schedule depositions for the first three individuals and indicated that coordination would likely occur after the holidays.\n\nThat same day, December 22, 2022, Sarena responded affirming that they were open to dates in February and asked to review availability. She affirmed openness to the month of February and provided contact context for coordination.\n\nOn December 28, 2022, the parties continued to coordinate. Jessica Wiedersatz asked Rick Neal to let her know when he was ready for her to look into dates, so she could propose concrete options. Rick replied that they could proceed and that he would follow up on scheduling. The exchanges also included other participants and reminders that potential witnesses would be Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, with Nick Smoke no longer with the defendant, and that scheduling would likely occur after the holidays.\n\nFurther back-and-forth in December 2022 referenced both the need to disclose the full names of Coup Construction employees listed in Dr. Wolens\u2019 report and the plan to schedule depositions of the identified lay witnesses after the holidays, with February as the target window.\n\nMoving into January 2023, Jessica requested a specific February date that Mr. Whaley had open for the lay witness depositions, noting that providing a concrete date would make it easier to coordinate with the witnesses. Sarena asked for clarification on whether the February date would cover all three witnesses or just one, and Jessica responded that she was aiming to take all three depositions\u2014Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, and Jason Jackman\u2014on February 13, 2023, beginning at 2:00 PM, and that she had already contacted the witnesses to confirm.\n\nSarena acknowledged Jessica\u2019s plan on January 12, 2023, writing, \u201cAwesome. Thank you for the clarification, just wanted to make sure I have it noted properly.\u201d She included her standard firm contact details and noted the address for The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, KY, along with D (direct) and O (office) numbers and her email (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), while also reminding that this is a new email address.\n\nThe next day, January 20, 2023, Jessica advised that she had finally gathered all of the employer witnesses and prepared the deposition notice. She asked Sarena to let her know if anything else was needed. In response, on January 20, 2023 at 2:13 PM, Sarena replied, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome. Thank you so much Jessica, I know that was not an easy task.\u201d Her signature then included The Whaley Law Firm's contact details and again noted the new email address.\n\nIn summary, the parties worked through December 2022 to January 2023 to identify the appropriate lay witnesses (Nick Hyde, Eric Burkstom, Jason Jackman, with Nick Smoke no longer with the defendant), confirm February availability, and schedule three depositions to take place on February 13, 2023, beginning at 2:00 PM. A deposition notice for these witnesses was prepared and circulated as of January 20, 2023.",

I have attached what I received\nfrom PNC on Keith Graser's checking account. The account statements run\nfrom September to December. You can see charges each month to Walmart,\nWalgreens, Kroger, Costco etc. I have spoken to Mrs. Graser and she relates\nthat she would use the card in those places and made the charges. The two\nof them did not have a joint account and one of the ways they had split the\nbills was that Keith was responsible for groceries. Since Keith was not\nreceiving income at this time you can also see Zel deposits from Mrs.\nGraser into Keith's account. This was just so they could keep track of the\nseparate charges. I can provide you with an affidavit from Mrs. Graser or\nif you like we can schedule a follow up deposition.\n\nI have reviewed the previous depositions in this matter and while there are\nsome other employees that I could depose I don't think that is necessary.\nThere are some items from the deposition that I would like to get from\nCoupe that were mentioned in the deposition. I would like a list of all\nemployees that would have been in the office at Coupe during the week Keith\nwas working. It was mentioned that as many as 8 different office staff\ncould have been there. It was mentioned in Eric Bergstrom's deposition that\nKeith may have worked with someone on the Paul's Fruit market job. I would\nlike to have all records of who worked on the Paul's Fruit Market Job. I\nwould like to have any record of staff quarantined after Keith's Covid\nDiagnosis. I can file a formal Interrogatory on this if you like.\n\nDoug, any interest in discussing a resolution to this case? Thanks.\n\n-- \nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022",
      "natural_language": "This narrative concerns the Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020), with the client listed as the Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nOn May 4, 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Doug Dusellis and others regarding Keith Graser\u2019s finances. He attached bank statements from PNC for Keith Graser\u2019s checking account, covering September through December. The statements show monthly charges at Walmart, Walgreens, Kroger, Costco, and similar retailers. Whaley reported that he spoke with Mrs. Graser, who stated that she would use the card for those purchases and that she made the charges. The note explains that the couple did not have a joint account, and Keith was not receiving income at that time; accordingly, Zel deposits from Mrs. Graser into Keith\u2019s account were made so they could track the separate charges. Whaley offered to provide an affidavit from Mrs. Graser or to schedule a follow-up deposition if desired.\n\nWhaley also stated that he has reviewed the prior depositions in this matter and that, while there are other employees who could be deposed, he does not think that is necessary at this time. He identified several discovery items from the deposition that he would like to obtain from Coupe Construction. Specifically, he seeks a list of all employees who would have been in Coupe\u2019s office during the week Keith was working, noting that as many as eight different office staff could have been present. He also noted in Eric Bergstrom\u2019s deposition that Keith may have worked with someone on the Paul\u2019s Fruit Market job, and he would like to obtain all records of who worked on that project. Additionally, he requests any records of staff quarantined after Keith\u2019s Covid diagnosis, and he offered to file a formal Interrogatory on this issue if desired. He closed by asking whether there is any interest in discussing a resolution to the case.\n\nDoug, any interest in discussing a resolution to this case?

This is the amount he was paid in December 2020 while he was off work due to his illness. The applicable state AWW for the same period was $890.00 which would provide a weekly benefit to Mr. Graser?s widow of $445.00. Mr. Graser?s birthdate was July 7, 1958. This means from the date of the death, weekly benefits would be paid to my client?s widow for approximately 7.5 years (390 weeks) at the rate identified above. These weekly benefits over that period of time equate to $173,550.00. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFurther, the KRS 342.750(6) lump sum death benefit amount on December 7, 2020 (the first date off work from COVID) was $87,421.45. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThus, at this time, our demand for full and final settlement of this claim is $260,971.45. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThank you for your consideration in this regard and I hope to hear from you soon. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nW.

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, docket 2022-00007, in the Estate of Keith Graser matter (Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020). The client is the Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nChronology of discovery communications\n\nOn October 23, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to counsel for the defense\u2014Rick Neal of Umaki Law & Associates and Doug U\u2019Sellis\u2014cc\u2019ing KeithGraserWCZ954685@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The subject was Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007). In the body of the email, Koon stated, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Please see the attached requests. The associated notice was filed today via LMS.\u201d The email carried The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or otherwise protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not use or forward the information.\n\nOn November 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM, Rick Neal replied to Bryce Koon and Doug U\u2019Sellis, cc\u2019ing Aaron Whaley. Neal wrote that he had written the employer and requested the information that had been asked for in the interrogatories, but that the document request appeared very broad. He asked whether the request could be narrowed and whether the documents sought were essentially limited to anything related to COVID or COVID exposure. Neal signed as Richard E. Neal of U-Sellis Mayer & Associates, with the firm\u2019s address at 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207, and included the firm\u2019s website and contact information. He also noted that the email was generated using voice recognition software and reminded recipients of the confidentiality standards.\n\nOn November 10, 2023, Bryce Koon responded: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up and see if you had gotten responses back from the employer to our Interrogatories. Regarding the document requests, we are essentially looking for any documents from the period of November 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020 (such as job reports, time cards, payroll records, schedules, etc.) relating to any individuals identified in Interrogatory 1. Hope this helps clarify some things. If you need for me to amend or issue a more specific RFPD in this regard, I am happy to do so.\u201d The email again carried the same confidentiality notice and was signed by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and phone/fax numbers, and the standard protective disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on December 6, 2023, at 11:50:43 a.m. Eastern Time (as indicated by the -0500 time zone), Bryce Koon sent a follow-up message beginning, \u201cGood morning counsel, I just wanted to follow up on this one. Any update would be greatly appreciated.\u201d The message included Koon\u2019s contact details for The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone: 502-365-5043; fax: 502-237-3207) and again carried the confidentiality and privilege notices advising that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information; recipients are instructed not to use or forward the contents if the message was received in error.\n\nAcross all messages, the subject line consistently referenced Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007). The communications centered on discovery-related items, including attached discovery requests filed via LMS on October 23, 2023, and a discussion of interrogatories and related document production requests. The document requests were described as pertaining to documents from November 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020, including items such as job reports, time cards, payroll records, and schedules, and they were to relate to individuals identified in Interrogatory 1. The parties considered whether the requests should be narrowed, and Bryce Koon offered to amend or issue a more specific Request for Production of Documents (RFPD) if needed.\n\nThis summary reflects the full thread of communications dated October 23, 2023; November 3, 2023; November 10, 2023; and December 6, 2023, including the confidentiality and privilege notices embedded in each message.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (case number 2022-00007), the estate\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation defense matter involved a series of discovery communications between counsel for the estate, W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, and counsel for the defense, Rick Neal and Doug U\u2019Sellis of U-Sellis Mayer & Associates, during late 2023. The file label for the matter is Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, with the client listed as the Estate of Keith Graser. Each email included the standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn October 23, 2023, Bryce Koon sent an email to Rick Neal and Doug U\u2019Sellis, with Keith Graser\u2019s file cc\u2019d via a Filevine link, attaching discovery requests and noting that the associated notice had been filed that day via LMS. The email indicated that the attached requests were being provided to the opposing side in the case and signed off with Bryce\u2019s firm\u2019s contact information and the customary privilege notice.\n\nOn November 3, 2023, Rick Neal replied to Bryce and Aaron Whaley (cc: Keith Graser\u2019s Filevine link) asking for clarification on the discovery demands. He stated that he had written the employer and requested information consistent with the interrogatories but found the document requests to be very broad. He asked whether the parties were essentially seeking documents related to COVID or COVID exposure and suggested narrowing the scope accordingly. He again included his firm\u2019s contact details and the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn November 10, 2023, Bryce followed up, asking whether responses had been obtained from the employer regarding the interrogatories. He reiterated that the document requests sought any documents from November 1, 2020 to December 15, 2020 (such as job reports, time cards, payroll records, schedules, etc.) relating to individuals identified in Interrogatory 1. Bryce offered to amend or issue a more specific Request for Production of Documents (RFPD) if needed. The message again carried Bryce\u2019s firm information and the privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn December 6, 2023, Bryce sent another follow-up to Rick Neal and Doug U\u2019Sellis, checking in for any updates regarding the case discovery, and closing with his standard contact details and privilege notice.\n\nFinally, on December 13, 2023, Bryce wrote confirming receipt of the then-current materials and thanking Rick for providing what appeared to be everything needed. Rick Neal replied, indicating that he had now received the balance of the information. He stated that the Jackson Associates office staff\u2014specifically Sally Woidich (Office Manager), Melody Smallwood (A/R/Payroll), and Wanda Weibel (AP Clerk)\u2014were the accounting/clerical team who could or would have been in the office. He attached PDFs of their schedules and suggested that this content would complete the discovery. He signed as Richard E. Neal of U-Sellis Mayer & Associates and included his firm\u2019s contact information. Bryce acknowledged receipt and noted that the materials should be everything they needed. This final exchange also included standard privilege notices on the emails.",

The correspondence centers on scheduling that deposition and deciding where it would take place.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates emailed Sarena Tuttle requesting an updated deposition of Ms. Graser. Jessica noted that her firm would like to depose Ms. Graser and asked whether the deposition should occur at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates\u2019 office or at The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office. She mentioned that U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates had recently moved to the St. Matthews area, near the St. Matthews Mall, and she listed available start times of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m., with flexibility on the start time.

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nIn the matter identified as Re: Updated Deposition of Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, communications ran between Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding scheduling the updated deposition of Nancy Graser. The exchange begins with a January 3, 2024 email from Jessica to Sarena noting that Doug wants to push Ms. Graser\u2019s January 17, 2024 deposition out a bit to allow time to obtain documents being requested via subpoena duces tecum. Jessica proposed several alternative dates for the deposition and indicated that a start time of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. Eastern would be convenient for her side, asking whether any of the following dates would work: January 30, January 31, February 1, or February 2. She closed by asking Sarena to call out the preferred start time.\n\nEarlier, on December 19, 2023, Jessica had indicated that, given this was an updated deposition, Zoom would be acceptable and that she had scheduled the deposition for January 17, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. She attached the notice and noted that the Zoom link information was contained in the notice; she also provided a direct Zoom link and related meeting details. The Zoom invitation read: Topic: Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction; Time: January 17, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time (US and Canada). Join Zoom Meeting at https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87663326396, with Meeting ID: 876 6332 6396 and no passcode required.\n\nPrior to that, on December 19, 2023 at 10:57 a.m., Sarena replied that their office was available on January 17, 2024 starting at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom, but that they could also host the deposition at Jessica\u2019s office, especially since Jessica\u2019s office was nearby. Sarena provided contact information for herself, noting her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and listed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the same extension in use for the office line. The message signaled openness to either arrangement given the closeness of the parties.\n\nA follow-up from December 18, 2023 at approximately 2:55 p.m. from Jessica stated the desire to take an updated deposition of Ms. Graser. She noted that the previous deposition had been held in their office and asked whether the deposition could be held in the Whaley firm\u2019s office or theirs, given that Jessica\u2019s firm had moved to the St. Matthews area near the St. Matthews Mall. Jessica listed available dates for the updated deposition as January 12, January 17, January 19, and January 22, with a start time of either 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m., and she requested confirmation of what would work for Mr. Whaley. Her signature identified her as a Paralegal for U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, including the firm\u2019s mailing address at 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207; phone 502-736-3600; fax 502-736-3606; website www.umakylaw.com; and email jwiedersatz@umakylaw.com, along with the firm\u2019s tagline and a small image.\n\nAlso included in the communications was a Zoom invitation from U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates inviting participants to a scheduled Zoom meeting for the Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, with the Zoom link, meeting information, and related details as described above. The overall thread reflects the estate\u2019s counsel coordinating with the defense firm regarding the updated deposition, including preferred locations, potential dates, and the use of Zoom for the deposition, as well as the consideration of subpoenaed documents necessitating a brief delay of the deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nRe: Updated Deposition of Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction. This correspondence summarizes a series of emails between The Whaley Law Firm, representing the Estate of Keith Graser, and U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, regarding an updated deposition of Nancy Graser in the case against Coupe Construction.\n\nOn December 18, 2023, Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates wrote to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm that they would like to take an updated deposition of Ms. Graser. They noted that last time the deposition was held in their office and asked whether the deposition should be held in Whaley\u2019s office or in U\u2019Sellis Mayer\u2019s office, mentioning that U\u2019Sellis Mayer had moved to the St. Matthews area near the St. Matthews Mall. They proposed several dates for the deposition: January 12, January 17, January 19, and January 22, with start times of 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM, expressing flexibility and asking Sarena to indicate what would work for Mr. Whaley.\n\nLater on December 18, 2023 at 3:02 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied that she would check with Aaron on the matter and update Jessica as soon as possible. Her signature identified her as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nOn December 19, 2023 at 10:57 AM, Sarena followed up from The Whaley Law Firm, stating that their office is available on January 17, 2024 starting at 10:00 AM via Zoom, and that they could also hold the deposition at U\u2019Sellis Mayer\u2019s office since they are nearby. Her contact details were included again in this message.\n\nAlso on December 19, 2023 at 11:21 AM, Jessica replied that Zoom would be fine for the updated deposition. She stated that she had set the deposition for January 17, 2024 at 10:00 AM and attached the notice. She noted that the Zoom link information was on the notice and provided the Zoom link below, along with the meeting details: \u201cZOOM LINK,\u201d and the meeting information for \u201cDepo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction.\u201d The Zoom join link was https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87663326396, with Meeting ID 876 6332 6396 and no passcode required. She invited further communication if anything else was needed.\n\nThe preceding messages also included a prior exchange dated December 19, 2023 at 10:57 AM, when Sarena stated that the office was available for the January 17, 2024 deposition starting at 10:00 AM via Zoom, reiterating flexibility about location since U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates is nearby.\n\nOn January 3, 2024, at 2:31 PM (the timestamp appears as 2:31?PM in the record), Jessica wrote that Doug requested a slight postponement of Ms. Graser\u2019s January 17, 2024 deposition to allow time to obtain documents via subpoena duces tecum. Jessica asked whether any of the following dates would work: January 30, January 31, February 1, or February 2, with a start time of either 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM Eastern. She noted flexibility with the start time and invited Sarena to call to confirm the preferred start time.\n\nFinally, on January 4, 2024, at 11:22 AM, Sarena responded that the only date that works for their office is January 30, 2024, with a start time of 10:00 AM via Zoom. Her message included the same contact details and again emphasized the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nThis note documents the sequence of communications about an updated deposition of Nancy Graser in the matter of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction. The exchange primarily occurred between Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, and Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with ongoing involvement from Doug Whaley.\n\nThe earliest dated thread begins with Jessica\u2019s December 18, 2023 message. She outlined the desire to conduct an updated deposition of Ms. Graser and noted that the deposition had been held previously in their office. Jessica asked whether they preferred to hold the deposition at Whaley\u2019s office or at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, which had moved to the St. Matthews area near the St. Matthews mall. She proposed several dates\u2014January 12, January 17, January 19, and January 22\u2014with start times of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m., and asked for Mr. Whaley\u2019s preferred start time.\n\nLater that same day, December 18, 2023 at 3:02 p.m., Sarena replied that she would check with Aaron and provide an update as soon as possible.\n\nOn December 19, 2023 at 10:57 a.m., Sarena informed Jessica that their office was available for an updated deposition on January 17, 2024, starting at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom, though they could also accommodate a deposition at Whaley\u2019s office, given that Jessica\u2019s office was nearby. She provided her contact details and noted the new email address.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 11:21 a.m. on December 19, 2023, Jessica responded that, for an updated deposition, Zoom would be fine. She had set the deposition for January 17, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. and attached the notice. The Zoom link information was included in the notice, and she provided the link directly: Zoom meeting for \u201cDepo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction,\u201d scheduled for January 17, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The join link was https://us06web.zoom.us/j/87663326396, with Meeting ID 876 6332 6396 and no passcode required.\n\nOn January 3, 2024, at approximately 2:31 p.m. (the time is shown as 2:31?PM in the record), Jessica proposed pushing Ms. Graser\u2019s January 17, 2024 deposition out a bit to allow time to obtain documents via subpoena duces tecum. She asked which of the following dates would work: January 30, January 31, February 1, or February 2, and noted that start times of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. Eastern were acceptable, though they were flexible.\n\nThe following day, January 4, 2024, at 11:23 a.m., Sarena responded that the only date that works for their office is January 30, 2024, with a start time of 10:00 a.m. via Zoom. She also noted the continued use of the same Zoom link as before and included her signature, which now indicates the new email address for contact.\n\nIn the same thread, at 4:45:40 p.m. on January 4, 2024, Jessica acknowledged and stated that she had attached the amended notice and that the Zoom link would remain the same as before.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details were cited in the messages: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d These details also appear in the signatures within the exchanges.\n\nIn summary, the deposition planning evolved from an initial set of possible dates in mid-January (with a preference for a 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. start and the option to hold the deposition at either office) to a narrowed arrangement centered on January 17, 2024 via Zoom. That plan was subsequently revised due to the need to obtain subpoenaed documents, shifting the available date window to late January or early February, with January 30, 2024 at 10:00 a.m. via Zoom being the date that Whaley\u2019s office could accommodate. The existing amended notice and Zoom link remained in effect, and the parties continued to coordinate through Jessica and Sarena, with the case details remaining tied to the Estate of Keith Graser in the matter of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction.",

Coupe Construction case, docket number 2022-00007, arising under Keith Graser\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation matter, with the Estate of Keith Graser as the client.\n\nIn December 2023, Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, sent two subpoena duces tecum documents to Abbie G. Lewis at ky.gov in connection with the Graser v. Coupe Construction case. The emails indicated that the subpoenas were to be reviewed and signed by Judge Rice-Smith (Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s assistant, Abbie Lewis), so that the requested additional information could be obtained in the claim. Jessica noted that she had copied Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on the communication. The email was dated December 27, 2023, at 2:41 PM, and it carried the subject Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007. Jessica attached the two subpoenas, and she reminded Abbie that two subpoena duces tecums were attached for review and sign-off. The message also included a confidentiality disclaimer and a caution regarding PDF attachments that may contain links to malicious sites.\n\nThe communications show that Jessica\u2019s outreach was part of a broader sequence. In the same chain, on December 27, 2023, Jessica\u2019s message to Abbie included that she had copied Sarena Tuttle and had provided Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office with the information to keep them informed. The signature block for Jessica included her role as Paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and her contact details: 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207; phone 502-736-3600; fax 502-736-3606; website www.umakylaw.com; and a note stating the firm has provided Workers\u2019 Compensation defense throughout Kentucky and Indiana since 2002.\n\nSubsequently, on January 4, 2024 at 11:58 AM, Jessica forwarded the prior thread to Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims. In that forwarding, she explained that the attachments and the prior communications had been sent to Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s assistant, Abbie, on 12/27/24. She then noted that Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan had been assigned to the claim and that she wanted to send the attached subpoenas to Lisa for Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s review and signature. Jessica stated that she had copied Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on the email so they would be aware of the communication, and she requested Lisa\u2019s assistance. The message carried the same subject line as before and included the standard courtesy to contact her office if any further information was needed. The email also contained the confidentiality notice that appears in the correspondence.\n\nLisa C. Chaffin responded on January 9, 2024, at 2:56 PM. In her reply, she asked Jessica to resubmit the subpoenas with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name in place of Monica Rice Smith\u2019s. She thanked Jessica for the update and identified her role as the Paralegal to Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, Administrative Law Judge, with the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims. The message included a confidential information disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, January 9, 2024, at 20:01:16 +0000, Jessica replied that she had mistakenly believed she had sent the updated subpoenas previously. She apologized to Lisa and attached the updated subpoenas, this time with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name included. She stated, \u201cMy apologies, Lisa. I could have sworn I sent the updated subpoenas to you, but apparently I didn't! Please find them attached.\u201d The email again cited the subject Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007 and included the confidential information disclaimer from the recipient\u2019s message thread.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the subject remained consistent: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007, in which the Estate of Keith Graser seeks subpoenas duces tecums to obtain additional information in the claim, with Judge O\u2019Bryan (Kimberly O\u2019Bryan) now assigned to the matter, and updates to substitute her name for Monica Rice Smith\u2019s on the subpoenas.",

The message requested that a resubmission be prepared with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name substituted for Monica Rice Smith\u2019s.\n\nEarlier correspondence shows that on January 4, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz forwarded an email to Lisa Chaffin, with Abbie G.

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nThe matter described is Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007). Over the course of several communications in January 2024, the parties discussed obtaining signed subpoenas and scheduling depositions in the case, with particular attention to having documents from PNC and Discover produced before deposition.\n\nThe sequence begins with an email from Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, on January 19, 2024. She informed Jessica Wiedersatz that she had the judge\u2019s permission to sign subpoenas on the judge\u2019s behalf and to issue them, but she noted that she and her office were snowed in and working from home, with no ability to print or scan and return documents. She said she would figure out a solution and work on the matter that day and would keep Jessica posted. In her signature block, Chaffin identified herself as paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan.\n\nEarlier, on January 18, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, wrote that they had not yet received signed subpoenas back and were concerned there might not be enough time to forward the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by the deposition date of January 24, 2024. Jessica attached updated subpoenas with a new deposition date of February 9, 2024 and explained that this change was intended to provide more time to obtain Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. She also noted that she would reschedule Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition to ensure the parties would have the documents from PNC and Discover before taking the deposition. In this email, she cc\u2019d Sarena Tuttle to keep the other side informed and indicated she would send another email regarding the rescheduling.\n\nThe thread shows a longer back-and-forth earlier in January. On January 17, 2024, Chaffin replied that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign. Earlier that same day, Jessica had asked for an update on whether Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed the subpoenas they had sent, expressing appreciation for any information she could provide.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, there was a push to update the subpoenas with the correct judge\u2019s name. Jessica\u2019s message at 3:01 PM acknowledged an earlier delay in sending the updated subpoenas and included the updated attachments. Lisa replied at 4:17 PM, confirming that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign. Earlier that day, at 2:56 PM, Lisa had requested that Jessica replace Monica Rice Smith\u2019s name with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s on the subpoenas. Jessica confirmed the update with her 3:01 PM message, and the exchange included cautionary notes about PDF attachments potentially containing links to malicious sites.\n\nA prior exchange from January 9, 2024 also shows Jessica\u2019s earlier outreach requesting status updates on the signing of the subpoenas, and Lisa\u2019s acknowledgment that she would ensure Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign. This sequence followed an earlier message on January 9, 2024 at 9:27 AM from Jessica requesting information on the status of Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signing.\n\nThe thread\u2019s earlier portion shows correspondence beginning with Jessica\u2019s message on January 4, 2024. In that communication, she referenced that they had sent the attached subpoenas and the information below to Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s assistant, Abbie, on December 27, 2024 (a date that appears to be a typographical note in the record). Jessica stated that Judge O\u2019Bryan had been assigned to the claim and that she wanted Abbie to review and sign the subpoenas, and she noted that she had copied Mr. Graser\u2019s attorneys on the communication.\n\nThat December 27, 2023 note is followed by the January 4, 2024 message from Jessica to Lisa, reiterating that the subpoenas had been sent to Abbie for Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s review and signature, with Abbie and Mr. Graser\u2019s attorneys copied for awareness.\n\nIn addition to the above, the record shows that the subpoenas were issued in the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction matter, with the subpoenas directed to PNC and Discover, and that the deposition dates on initial submissions were set for January 24, 2024, with a plan to realign to later dates as needed to accommodate the production of documents.\n\nOverall, the communications reflect an effort to obtain sign-off on subpoenas from the Administrative Law Judge (initially Judge Rice-Smith, later replaced by Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan), to adjust the subpoenas to reflect the correct judge\u2019s name, and to reschedule depositions to allow time for document production from PNC and Discover. The parties also noted practical challenges, including weather-related barriers to processing documents, which led to the decision to set a new deposition date of February 9, 2024, on the updated subpoenas, and to consider rescheduling the 1/30/24 deposition in light of document availability.\n\nIn sum, these notes chronicle the lead-up to and modification of subpoenas in the Estate of Keith Graser\u2019s case against Coupe Construction, detailing judge sign-offs, changes of judge name, deposition scheduling shifts from late January toward early February, and the logistical issues encountered in issuing and returning signed subpoenas.",

      "natural_language": "This note relates to the Estate of Keith Graser in the Workers\u2019 Compensation case Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007). The communications are between the Estate\u2019s counsel and state agency personnel responsible for issuing subpoenas, with the goal of obtaining subpoenas duces tecum and securing signatures from Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, so that documents from PNC and Discover could be produced before deposition dates.\n\nThe sequence begins with December 27, 2023, when Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates emailed Abbie G. Lewis at ky.gov, attaching two subpoena duces tecums and requesting Judge Rice-Smith to review them. The email, sent to Abbie with Sarena Tuttle copied, was titled Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007. In the body, Jessica wrote that the two subpoenas were attached for Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s review.\n\nBy January 4, 2024, Jessica followed up, noting that Abbie Rice-Smith\u2019s assistant had previously received the attached subpoenas on 12/27/24 (a date that appears to be a typographical error in the record). She explained that Judge O\u2019Bryan had been assigned to the claim and indicated she would send the attached subpoenas to Lisa Chaffin for the judge\u2019s review and signature, copying Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office so they would be aware of the communication.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, Lisa Chaffin replied that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign. Earlier that same day, in her reply, Lisa asked Jessica to resubmit the subpoenas with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name replacing Monica Rice Smith\u2019s. Jessica responded shortly after, apologizing for the confusion and attaching the updated subpoenas. Lisa followed with another note at 2:56 PM requesting the substitution, and at 4:17 PM she confirmed that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoenas.\n\nIn the subsequent days, Jessica checked in regarding the signing. On January 17, 2024, she asked Lisa for an update on whether Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed the subpoenas. Lisa replied that the judge would be back in the office the next day to sign. Jessica acknowledged and asked for the status again, while Lisa confirmed the plan to obtain the judge\u2019s signature.\n\nBy January 18, 2024, Jessica explained that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and expressed concern about timing. She attached updated subpoenas with a new deposition date of February 9, 2024, in hopes of giving more time to obtain Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and to issue the requests to PNC and Discover. Jessica noted that they would like to have documents from PNC and Discover prior to taking Keith Graser\u2019s deposition and mentioned rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition. She told Sarena Tuttle that she would send another email regarding the rescheduling and thanked Jessica for the assistance. The note also included Jessica\u2019s professional contact information and the firm\u2019s branding.\n\nFinally, on January 22, 2024, Lisa Chaffin sent a follow-up email with the subject line \u201cRe: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007,\u201d stating that the subpoenas were signed and attached. The message closed with the standard confidentiality footer used by the Office of Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the primary issues were: replacing the earlier requester names on the subpoenas to reflect Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, obtaining the judge\u2019s signatures, coordinating with Abbie Rice-Smith\u2019s office and later Abbie Lewis\u2019s involvement, accommodating rescheduling needs for deposition dates (notably moving from 1/24/24 to 2/9/24 for the deposition date on the subpoenas), and ensuring documents from PNC and Discover would be in hand before Keith Graser\u2019s deposition (initially set for 1/30/24). The communications also show ongoing coordination with Sarena Tuttle of Whaley Law Firm and the involvement of Mr. Graser\u2019s attorneys as recipients on the correspondences.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020\nClient: Estate of Keith Graser\n\nIn the matter concerning the deposition of Nancy Graser in the Estate of Keith Graser (case WC-12-07-2020), communications regarding scheduling were exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and Uma Sells Mayer & Associates. The Whaley firm represented the Estate of Keith Graser, and the deposition issue centered on Ms. Graser in connection with the Keith Graser matter.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates emailed Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, proposing to reschedule Ms. Graser\u2019s Zoom deposition, which was originally set for January 30, 2024, to a date after February 9, 2024. The aim was to allow time to obtain documentation from PNC and Discover prior to the deposition. Jessica asked whether any of the following dates could work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon: February 13; February 14 (afternoon); February 15 (afternoon); February 19; and February 20 (afternoon). The message included Jessica\u2019s contact details and stated that Uma Sells Mayer & Associates provides Workers\u2019 Compensation defense in Kentucky and Indiana since 2002. Jessica\u2019s firm address was listed as 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207, with phone (502) 736-3600 and fax (502) 736-3606.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied on January 19, 2024 (time listed as 10:47?AM in the record), explaining that while she understood the desire to reschedule again, she would need to confer with Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon regarding any possible objections to a second rescheduling. She indicated she would update Jessica as soon as possible. Sarena\u2019s signature identified her as a Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct dial (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The signature also noted to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nA follow-up exchange occurred on January 22, 2024. In that message, also from Sarena Tuttle to Jessica Wiedersatz (time listed as 10:29:37 -0500 in the header), Sarena stated that the office had received the executed SDTs back that morning and that they should hold off on rescheduling for the time being. She explained that it can take some time to receive a proper response from such companies and that their office would want to review any and all documents received prior to the deposition of Mrs. Graser. She invited Jessica and her office to contact them directly if they had any questions in further detail. This January 22 email was CC\u2019d to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm. The Whaley firm\u2019s address, contact details, and Sarena\u2019s updated email (noted in her signature as the new address) were included in the correspondence.\n\nIn sum, the parties discussed delaying Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition to obtain necessary documents from third-party lenders, with a plan to confirm objection-based rescheduling, and, as of January 22, 2024, the Wranglers held off on rescheduling while awaiting the SDTs\u2019 responses and a review of incoming documents. The communications also documented the involved firms\u2019 contact details and the fact that the correspondence included CCs to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, case 2022-00007, the matter in early 2024 involved obtaining discovery from Discover Bank and PNC. The attorney team, led by Jessica Wiedersatz, planned to issue subpoenas and deposition notices not to hold live depositions, but to secure the requested information from Discover and PNC.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Jessica emailed Lisa C. Chaffin to note that updated subpoenas needed to be reviewed for Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures, since Judge O\u2019Bryan had been assigned to the claim. She explained that they had previously sent the attached materials to Judge Rice-Smith\u2019s assistant, Abbie, on December 27, 2024 (a detail reflected in the thread), and she requested review and signatures. Jessica also copied Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on that message.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, Lisa responded that the subpoenas should be resubmitted with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name in place of Monica Rice Smith\u2019s, and Jessica apologized for not sending the updated subpoenas earlier, attaching them for the judge\u2019s review. Later that same day, at 3:01 PM, Jessica again apologized for the oversight and confirmed that the updated subpoenas were attached.\n\nBy 4:17 PM on January 9, 2024, Lisa indicated that there was no problem and that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the subpoenas, with confidentiality notices included in the correspondence.\n\nOn January 17, 2024, Jessica checked in on the status of Judge O\u2019Bryan signing the subpoenas. Lisa replied at 10:31 AM that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign. Earlier, at 9:27 AM, Jessica had again inquired about the signing status.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Jessica noted that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and expressed concern that there would not be enough time to issue the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by the 1/24/24 deposition date shown on the subpoenas. In response, she attached updated subpoenas with a deposition date of 2/9/24 and stated that this would give more time to obtain O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. She informed Sarena that she was CC\u2019ing her to keep her abreast of communications with the ALJ\u2019s office and that she would send another email about rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s 1/30/24 deposition so that documents from PNC and Discover could be reviewed prior to the deposition.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa sent an email with attached signed subpoenas and asked Jessica to let her know if there were any questions or concerns. Jessica replied the same day, attaching copies of the letters, deposition notices, and subpoenas that were being sent to Discover and PNC. She reiterated that the depositions themselves were not planned, and clarified that the goal was simply to obtain the requested information from Discover and PNC. The email also included the notes that the deposition date previously referenced in the subpoenas was 1/24/24, and that the flow of documents was intended to precede any deposition.\n\nThroughout this sequence, several confidentiality notices and standard cautions about email content and attachments appeared in the communications, reflecting the sensitive nature of the workers\u2019 compensation proceeding.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, Estate of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, case number 2022-00007, involves the Whaley Law Firm on behalf of the Estate of Keith Graser and opposing counsel at Umaki Law, with communications among Sarena M. Tuttle, Jessica Wiedersatz, and Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet\u2019s Department of Workers\u2019 Claims.\n\nOn Monday, January 22, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledged receipt of the prior materials. In her email, she provided her contact information and noted a new email address. Earlier that day, Jessica Wiedersatz at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates informed Sarena that attached to her message were copies of letters, deposition notices, and subpoenas being sent to Discover and PNC. Jessica explained that the deposits would not be held; rather, the purpose was to obtain the requested information from Discover and PNC.\n\nIn a prior thread, Lisa C. Chaffin, paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan in the Education & Labor Cabinet\u2019s Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, had sent a message indicating that the subpoenas were signed and attached, asking for whether any questions or concerns remained. This was followed by a series of communications starting January 18 and continuing into January 22, 2024, concerning the timing and signatures for the subpoenas.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Jessica noted that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and were concerned there would not be enough time to deliver the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by the deposition date of January 24, 2024, as specified on the subpoenas. In light of this, updated subpoenas with a new deposition date of February 9, 2024 were prepared in hopes of allowing time to obtain the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. Jessica also informed Sarena that she would send a separate update regarding rescheduling Keith Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition so that they could obtain the documents from PNC and Discover prior to taking the deposition. Jessica included a cc to Sarena to keep her apprised of communications with the ALJ\u2019s office.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on January 17, 2024, Lisa had indicated that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign. Jessica followed up on January 17, 2024, asking for the status of the judge\u2019s signature. Lisa had previously replied on January 9, 2024, that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the subpoenas. In that January 9 exchange, Jessica apologized for not sending the updated subpoenas and attached them. Lisa had earlier requested that the subpoenas be resubmitted with Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan\u2019s name in place of Monica Rice Smith\u2019s.\n\nThe chain also includes standard confidentiality notices typical of communications from the Education & Labor Cabinet and the involved law firms. Overall, by January 22, 2024, the parties were coordinating to obtain signed subpoenas and signatures from Judge O\u2019Bryan, reschedule the Graser deposition initially set for January 30, 2024, and extend the subpoena response timeline to February 9, 2024 to ensure Discover and PNC could be served and that the associated documents could be obtained before Keith Graser\u2019s deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. Re: Deposition of Nancy Graser re Keith Graser.\n\nIn the period surrounding January 2024, communications were exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates regarding the deposition of Nancy Graser in the Keith Graser matter. On Monday, January 22, 2024, at 11:37:48 -0500, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address), sent a message to Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates (address: 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207; phone 502-736-3600; fax 502-736-3606) with CCs to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon. The purpose of the note was simply to convey thanks.\n\nIn a response, Jessica Wiedersatz stated: \u201cThanks, Sarena. Attached please find a notice cancelling Ms. Graser\u2019s 1/30/24 deposition.\u201d This indicated that a notice cancelling the deposition had been attached to her reply.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:30 AM, Sarena had written to Jessica: \u201cGood morning Jessica, We see that your office received the executed SDTs back this morning. Let's hold off on rescheduling for the time being. As we are sure you're aware it can take some time to receive a proper response from such companies and our office will want to review any and all documents received prior to the deposition of Mrs. Graser. If you or your office has any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\u201d This conveyed that the parties intended to review any documents received before scheduling further deposition steps.\n\nEarlier still, on Friday, January 19, 2024, at 10:47 AM, Sarena wrote: \u201cGood morning Jessica, While I understand the desire to reschedule this deposition again, I will need to confer with Mr. Whaley & Mr. Koon for any possible objections they may have to a second rescheduling. I will update you as soon as possible.\u201d This noted the need to confer with the firm\u2019s principals before any additional rescheduling.\n\nAnd on Thursday, January 18, 2024, at 4:13 PM, Jessica had written: \u201cHi, Sarena \u2013 As you may have seen in my other email from this afternoon, we would like to reschedule Ms. Graser\u2019s 1/30/24 Zoom deposition to take place sometime after 2/9/24 so that we can attempt to receive the documentation we need from PNC and Discover prior to taking her deposition. Would any of the dates below work for Mr. Whaley/Mr. Koon? 2/13; 2/14 Afternoon; 2/15 Afternoon; 2/19; 2/20 Afternoon. Thank you, Jessica.\u201d This outlined the proposed post-2/9/24 windows for rescheduling the Zoom deposition and the rationale of acquiring documents from PNC and Discover beforehand.\n\nJessica\u2019s signature block followed, identifying her as a Paralegal for U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, with the firm\u2019s contact details and a note stating: \u201cProviding Workers Compensation defense throughout Kentucky and Indiana since 2002.\u201d The email also included the firm\u2019s website link.\n\nIn summary, the Estate of Keith Graser\u2019s deposition of Nancy Graser was cancelled for 1/30/24, and multiple parties discussed rescheduling after 2/9/24 to obtain required documentation from PNC and Discover, with follow-up communications indicating the need to review any received documents before rescheduling and to confer with Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon before any second rescheduling.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nIn late January 2024, communications circulated among the parties concerning the deposition of Nancy Graser in the Keith Graser matter. On January 18, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates (email jwiedersatz@umakylaw.com) wrote to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) with the subject Deposition of Nancy Graser re Keith Graser. Jessica proposed rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s 1/30/24 Zoom deposition to a date after February 9, 2024 to allow time to obtain documentation from PNC and Discover prior to the deposition. She asked which of the following dates would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon: February 13; February 14 (afternoon); February 15 (afternoon); February 19; or February 20 (afternoon). Jessica signed the message with her contact information and firm details, noting that her firm has been providing workers\u2019 compensation defense in Kentucky and Indiana since 2002.\n\nLater that same day, January 18, 2024, at 4:13 PM, Jessica\u2019s message is echoed in an email thread as she reiterates the rescheduling request. The content again requests to shift the Zoom deposition of Ms. Graser to after February 9, 2024 so that documentation from PNC and Discover can be obtained beforehand, and asks whether any of the proposed dates would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon.\n\nOn January 19, 2024, at approximately 10:47 AM (the timestamp in the record shows as 10:47?AM), Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, responded. She stated that while she understood the desire to reschedule again, she would need to confer with Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon regarding any possible objections to a second rescheduling and would update Jessica as soon as possible. The message was signed with Sarena\u2019s title and contact information, including her phone numbers and email address (please note new email address).\n\nA follow-up message from Jessica on January 22, 2024, at 10:30 AM, again addressed to Sarena with copies to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon, confirmed that her office had received the executed SDTs that morning. Sarena instructed to hold off on rescheduling for the time being, explaining that it could take time to obtain a proper response from the relevant companies and that their office would want to review any and all documents received before the deposition of Mrs. Graser. She invited Jessica to contact them directly with any questions and reiterated the importance of reviewing documents prior to deposition. Sarena\u2019s message closed with her signature, including her title, firm, address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971) and office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com).\n\nFinally, in the same thread on January 22, 2024 at 4:06 PM UTC, Jessica replied with a brief message thanking Sarena and attaching a notice canceling Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition. She signed off as Jessica, appending her contact details and reaffirming the cancellation of the deposition.\n\nIn summary, the Estate of Keith Graser\u2019s deposition of Nancy Graser originally set for January 30, 2024, was canceled and notice of the cancellation was attached. The parties discussed multiple potential rescheduling dates after February 9, 2024 to allow time to obtain documentation from PNC and Discover, with ongoing consideration of objections to further rescheduling. The parties acknowledged receipt of executed subpoenas or related documents (SDTs) and agreed to review all received materials before proceeding with the deposition of Mrs. Graser, while remaining open to further contact to resolve questions or objections.",

      "natural_language": "The Estate of Keith Graser, the client in the case labeled Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, was involved in Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007. Beginning in January 2024, communications circulated between Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, with Sarena Tuttle of Whaley Law Firm copied on several messages. The primary issue was obtaining records from financial institutions (PNC and Discover Financial Services) via subpoenas duces tecum in order to support the case, with deposition dates being adjusted accordingly, and with a stated intent not to actually hold a deposition at that time.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, Lisa Chaffin informed Jessica Wiedersatz that Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign the subpoenas. Later that day, Jessica repeated the message, asking to be apprised when the signing occurred. On January 9, 2024 at 3:01 PM and again at 4:17 PM, the correspondence centered on securing Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signature for the subpoenas. On January 17, 2024, Lisa advised that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign, and Jessica followed up again for the status of the signing. The following day, January 18, 2024, Jessica explained that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and expressed concern that there would not be enough time to deliver the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by the deposition date of January 24, 2024, as indicated on the subpoenas. In light of this, Jessica attached updated subpoenas that carried a deposition date of February 9, 2024, and she noted that this would give more time to obtain Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. She also indicated that she would be sending a subsequent email to reschedule Keith Graser\u2019s deposition previously set for January 30, 2024, so that the documents from PNC and Discover could be reviewed before the deposition. Jessica told Lisa that Sarena was copied to keep her abreast of the communication, and she reaffirmed the intention to obtain the documents prior to depositions.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa sent a message stating that the subpoenas had been signed and attached. The tone throughout these exchanges included standard confidentiality notices typical of such communications, indicating that the messages contained confidential information and were intended for the exclusive use of the recipient.\n\nBy late January, the parties continued coordinating with the administrative office. Jessica acknowledged that Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign the subpoenas and sought confirmation of the signing timeline. Lisa maintained that the judge would sign, and Jessica persisted in requesting updates. The parties repeatedly referenced the deposition dates and the need to obtain documents from PNC and Discover before proceeding with Keith Graser\u2019s deposition.\n\nAs events progressed into February 2024, Jessica prepared and sent additional correspondence to Discover, attaching a letter, a subpoena duces tecum, and a deposition notice that were being sent to Discover Financial Services. She explained that the effort was strictly to obtain the requested information and that there was no plan to actually hold the deposition. Lisa Chaffin responded with the signed subpoena, attaching it to the email and inviting any further questions or concerns. Jessica, in turn, advised that the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed had been sent to Discover, but Discover had denied the request because the subpoena had not been sent to the correct address. She attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with the corrected Discover address and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated document so that the records could again be sought from Discover. Jessica also noted that she had CC\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to keep them informed of the communication.\n\nIn sum, these intertwined exchanges depict a concerted, ongoing effort from January through February 2024 to obtain records from Discover Financial Services (and, previously, PNC) through signed subpoenas duces tecum, with deposition dates being adjusted from an initial 1/24/2024 date to a new 2/9/2024 date, and with a plan to reschedule the 1/30/2024 deposition to ensure the requested documents were reviewed before deposition. Throughout, the parties conveyed the expectation that Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign the subpoenas, and the communications included standard confidentiality notices as well as references to distributing copies to involved counsel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. In the matter captioned Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007), communications were exchanged between the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, and the law firm handling Keith Graser\u2019s estate regarding subpoenas duces tecum and deposition scheduling.\n\nOn January 9, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, advised Lisa C. Chaffin, paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, that she had attached updated subpoenas after realizing she had not previously sent them. Lisa responded later that day that she would have Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the subpoenas. The exchange included standard confidentiality notices in the email signatures.\n\nTwo days later, on January 9, 2024, Jessica followed up to confirm the status of the updated subpoenas she had sent and to ensure the judge would sign them. Lisa replied that there was no problem and that Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign.\n\nOn January 17, 2024, Jessica checked in again to learn when Judge O\u2019Bryan would sign the subpoenas. Lisa replied that the judge would be back in the office the next day to sign.\n\nThe next day, January 18, 2024, Jessica noted that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas and expressed concern that there would not be enough time to serve PNC and Discover by the deposition date of January 24, 2024, which had been provided on the subpoenas. She stated that she was attaching updated subpoenas with a deposition date of February 9, 2024, in hopes of allowing more time for Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and for sending the requests to PNC and Discover. Jessica also indicated she would send another email regarding rescheduling Keith Graser\u2019s deposition set for January 30, 2024, so that documents from PNC and Discover could be obtained prior to taking the deposition, and she cc\u2019d Sarena Tuttle to keep the Graser attorney\u2019s office informed.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa sent a reply with the subject line indicating that the subpoenas had been signed, attaching them for Jessica\u2019s review and inviting any questions or concerns.\n\nLater, on February 6, 2024, Jessica reported that the subpoenas had been sent to Discover, but Discover denied the request because the request was not sent to the correct address. She attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with the correct Discover address and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the document again so that they could pursue obtaining records from Discover. She again cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThat same day, February 6, 2024, at 3:50 PM (UTC), Lisa replied that the subpoena had been signed and attached as requested, inviting Jessica to contact her with any further questions or concerns.\n\nAll emails contained the standard confidentiality language noting that the communication is confidential and intended for the recipient, and that any disclosure or use by non-recipients may be unlawful. The communications also included the usual \u201cCAUTION\u201d notices about attachments in some messages. Jessica Wiedersatz\u2019s email signature identified her as a Paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, with the firm\u2019s Louisville contact information, and featured the firm\u2019s motto: \u201cProviding Workers Compensation defense throughout Kentucky and Indiana since 2002.\u201d Lisa C. Chaffin\u2019s signature identified her role as Paralegal to the Administrative Law Judge, with the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, and her contact information.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, with the client listed as the Estate of Keith Graser. The matter at hand is Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, case number 2022-00007. In February 2024, communications occurred between counsel and the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet\u2019s Department of Workers\u2019 Claims regarding subpoenas and deposition notices directed to Discover Financial Services (and related records requests), as part of discovery in the case. The communications track both the preparation of subpoenas and attempts to schedule depositions, including changes to deposition dates and the need to obtain documents prior to taking deposition.\n\nOn January seventeenth, two thousand twenty-four, Lisa C. Chaffin, a paralegal with the Education & Labor Cabinet and a paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, informed Jessica Wiedersatz that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign subpoenas. Jessica followed up later that same day, asking for the status of the subpoenas.\n\nOn January eighteenth, Jessica reported that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas and expressed concern that there would not be enough time to deliver the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by January twenty-four, nineteen twenty-four, which was the deposition date stated on the subpoenas. To address this, she attached updated subpoenas that carried a deposition date of February ninth, twenty-twenty-four, explaining that this extension would give them more time to obtain the ALJ\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. She also noted that Sarena had been cc\u2019d to stay abreast of the communication and that she would send another message regarding rescheduling Keith Graser\u2019s deposition originally set for January thirtieth, twenty-twenty-four, since they wanted to have the documents from PNC and Discover prior to taking the deposition.\n\nOn January twenty-two, Lisa replied that the subpoenas had been signed and attached, inviting Jessica to contact her with any questions or concerns. A subsequent exchange on January seventeenth through January eighteenth included standard confidentiality notices in the emails from Lisa, reminding recipients that the communications contained confidential information intended only for the named recipients.\n\nOn January eighteenth, Jessica also noted that, because they had not yet received the signed subpoenas, there was insufficient time to meet the deposition timeline. She reiterated that the deposition date on the subpoenas had been set for January twenty-four, and that they had updated the subpoenas to reflect a February ninth deposition date to allow more time for ALJ signatures and for sending requests to PNC and Discover. She mentioned that Sarena would be cc\u2019d and that she would send a separate email about rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition, which had been scheduled for January thirtieth, twenty-twenty-four, so that documents from PNC and Discover could be obtained first.\n\nBy February sixth, Jessica informed Lisa that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum, signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan, to Discover Financial Services. She explained that Discover had denied the records request because it was not sent to the correct address and attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with a corrected Discover address, requesting that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoena so they could again seek the records from Discover. She noted that she had cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to keep them informed of the communication.\n\nThat same day, Lisa responded. She indicated that the signed subpoenas were attached and asked Jessica to let her know if there were any additional questions or concerns.\n\nOn February seventh, two thousand twenty-four, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied, \u201cReceived, thank you,\u201d and provided her contact information. She noted her new email address and included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s mailing address, along with direct and office phone numbers, and email.\n\nThroughout this correspondence, the parties repeatedly referenced the subpoenas signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan, the deposition notices directed to Discover, the need to obtain records from Discover and PNC, and the intent to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition in a manner that allowed time to secure the requested documents before testimony. The communications also documented the ongoing collaboration among the legal teams, the ALJ\u2019s office, and the client\u2019s counsel as they navigated deposition dates and document production in connection with the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction matter.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes a sequence of email communications in the Estate-of-Keith-Graser matter, Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (case number 2022-00007), in which the Estate of Keith Graser is represented by U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and the Whaley Law Firm is coordinating the discovery process and deposition scheduling. The exchange spans mid-January to early February 2024 and centers on subpoenas to obtain records from Discover Financial Services and PNC, as well as the scheduling of Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition.\n\nBeginning in mid-January 2024, Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, working as a paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, indicated that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office soon to sign subpoenas related to the case. On January 17, 2024, Lisa advised Jessica Wiedersatz that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be available to sign the subpoenas the following day. Jessica followed up the same day, asking for the status of Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signature on the subpoenas.\n\nBy January 18, 2024, Jessica expressed concern that signed subpoenas had not yet been returned, noting that there would not be enough time to serve the subpoenas on PNC and Discover before the deposition date of January 24, 2024. She attached updated subpoenas with a deposition date of February 9, 2024, hoping this would provide additional time for Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and for the requests to be sent to PNC and Discover. She indicated she would cc Sarena Tuttle to keep her informed and mentioned that she would issue another email regarding rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition so that documents from PNC and Discover would be in hand prior to the deposition.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa responded with confirmation and attached the signed subpoenas, signaling that the signatories had been obtained and that the process could proceed.\n\nAs the process continued, Jessica reported on February 6, 2024 that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum, signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan, to Discover. Discover denied the request because the notice had not been sent to the correct address, and Jessica attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with the correct address for Discover. She requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoena so the records could be sought again from Discover. Jessica also cc\u2019d Keith Graser\u2019s attorneys to ensure they were aware of the communication.\n\nLater on February 6, 2024, Lisa responded that the signed subpoena had been attached as requested. On February 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt of the subpoena.\n\nBy February 8, 2024, Jessica acknowledged that Discover had not yet produced the subpoenaed documents and reiterated that the deposition scheduling was contingent on obtaining those documents. She proposed several potential deposition dates for Ms. Graser, proposing that the deposition could start at 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m., with flexibility on the start time. The dates she listed as open were February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only), and she asked for input on what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon. She emphasized that the documents from Discover were desired before Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and noted that the proof time was set to end on March 8, 2024.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications included the usual formalities and contact details of the participants: Jessica Wiedersatz, a paralegal with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates; Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm; and Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, who coordinated the subpoenas with Administrative Law Judge O\u2019Bryan. The thread confirms the parties\u2019 shared objective of obtaining Discover\u2019s records and scheduling Keith Graser\u2019s deposition in a timely manner, balancing the need for documents with the court\u2019s subpoena process and the scheduling realities of the involved attorneys.",

      "natural_language": "In the case titled Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, the client is the Estate of Keith Graser, involved in Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (Case No. 2022-00007). Beginning in early 2024, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s litigation team, led by Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates on the defense side, engaged in a series of communications to obtain subpoenas and to schedule the deposition of Ms. Graser, with the aim of obtaining documents from third parties before proceeding with deposition.\n\nOn January 6, 2024, Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, sent an email to Jessica with the signed subpoenas attached, indicating they were ready. By January 18, 2024, Jessica responded that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and expressed concern that there would not be enough time to send subpoenas to PNC and Discover by the deposition deadline of January 24, 2024. She noted that their proof time was set to end on March 8, 2024 and proposed moving Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition to occur before that date to avoid calendar conflicts. She attached subpoenas with a deposition date of February 9, 2024 and stated they hoped to obtain ALJ O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signatures and to send the requests to PNC and Discover. She also mentioned cc\u2019ing Sarena Tuttle to keep her informed and indicated she would send another email about rescheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition so that documents from PNC and Discover could be reviewed prior to deposition.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa responded that the subpoenas had been signed and attached. In a subsequent exchange later that same day, Jessica wrote that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum that Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed to Discover, but Discover denied the request because it was not sent to the correct address. She attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with a corrected Discover address and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated document so they could attempt to obtain Discover\u2019s records again. She also noted that she had cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to keep them informed.\n\nEarlier communications in the thread show that on February 6, 2024 Jessica again referenced subpoenas and related documents. She sent a message to Lisa indicating that they were emailing a letter, subpoena duces tecum, and deposition notice to Discover Financial Services to obtain the requested information, and she clarified that they did not plan to actually hold the deposition at that time. Lisa responded with confirmation and asked Jessica to advise if there were further questions or concerns. In response, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt of that communication on February 7, 2024.\n\nBy February 7 and February 8, 2024, the scheduling discussions intensified. Sarena replied \u201cReceived, thank you,\u201d and in a separate message she told Jessica that they could schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition on either February 28 or February 29. In Jessica\u2019s reply, she reiterated the ongoing issue of awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover, noting that the subpoena\u2019s due date was February 26, 2024. She explained that they wanted Discover\u2019s documents before Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and that, given their proof time ending March 8, 2024, they preferred scheduling before that deadline to avoid calendar pressures. She listed several potential start times and dates\u201410:00 AM or 2:00 PM\u2014and asked which would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon, offering flexibility on the start time. The proposed dates included February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (with March 4 being set for the morning only).\n\nFinally, on February 12, 2024, Sarena replied to Jessica that they could do the deposition on February 28 or February 29, reaffirming the possible dates and indicating continued coordination. Throughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the subpoenas, the deposition notices, and the goal of obtaining Discover\u2019s and PNC\u2019s documents prior to Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition, while balancing calendar constraints and the procedural deadlines set by the court and ALJ O\u2019Bryan.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser, case captioned Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007), the parties and counsel conducted a series of email exchanges in January and February 2024 concerning subpoenas and the scheduling of Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition. The client listed for the file is the Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nOn January 17, 2024, Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, who serves as Paralegal to Administrative Law Judge Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, advised Jessica Wiedersatz that Judge O\u2019Bryan would be back in the office the next day to sign subpoenas. The following day, January 18, 2024, Jessica responded that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and were concerned there would not be enough time to deliver subpoenas to PNC and Discover before the deposition date of January 24, 2024. She noted that their proof time was set to end on March 8, 2024 and asked to proceed with scheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before that date to avoid calendar conflicts. Jessica indicated they would prefer a deposition start time of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. and requested to know what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon. She also stated that an updated subpoena duces tecum would be attached and cc\u2019d Sarena Tuttle to keep her informed.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa replied that the subpoenas were signed and attached them for Jessica\u2019s use. She also reaffirmed that the subpoenas were to be used in the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction matter and provided her contact details, noting the email address change for Sarena Tuttle to Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nIn a prior thread carried forward, Jessica had previously indicated that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed to Discover Financial Services, but Discover had denied the request because it was not sent to the correct address. By January 18, 2024, Jessica was preparing updated subpoenas with the corrected address and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign them so they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover. She also cc\u2019d counsel for Mr. Graser to keep them apprised.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Jessica\u2019s message also noted that she was using subpoenas previously signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan and that the updated subpoenas would carry an updated deposition date of February 9, 2024, in light of the time constraints. She explained that the updated subpoenas were intended to allow time to obtain the necessary documents before steppings in for deposition. Jessica also attached updated subpoenas and indicated she would coordinate with Sarena Tuttle to keep Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon informed.\n\nEarlier, on January 22, 2024, Lisa confirmed via email that the signed subpoenas were attached and available for use. The thread shows the ongoing coordination among Jessica, Sarena, and the Whaley firm\u2019s clients in relation to the subpoenas and the deposition timeline.\n\nSubsequently, on February 6, 2024, Jessica informed Lisa that Discover had denied the subpoena request because it had been sent to the incorrect address, and she noted that the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed was being resent with an updated Discover address. She stated that they would ask Judge O\u2019Bryan to sign the updated subpoena so they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover and cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office to keep them informed. In the same message, Jessica attached the updated subpoena duces tecum and reiterated the purpose of obtaining the requested information rather than holding the deposition at that time.\n\nThat same day, February 6, Jessica attached the letter, subpoena duces tecum, and deposition notice to Discover Financial Services and explained that the earlier request had been denied due to the incorrect address, and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoena so records could be sought again. There is also a note indicating the contents were intended for the recipient and a confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn February 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied, acknowledging receipt of Jessica\u2019s communications with thanks.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, Jessica reiterated that they were awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover and reminded that the subpoena\u2019s due date was February 26, 2024. She explained the need to obtain Discover\u2019s documents before taking Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and, given that the proof time would end on March 8, 2024, proposed scheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before that date. She listed several open dates for deposition: February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only) and indicated that a start time of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m. would work, though they were flexible.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Sarena responded that they could do deposition on February 28 or February 29, confirming availability on those dates.\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Jessica replied, proposing February 29, 2024, provided it was still available, and asked whether 10:00 a.m. would work. She stated, \u201cLet\u2019s go with 2/29, please, if still available. How does 10AM sound?\u201d\n\nIn summary, the file involves the Estate of Keith Graser pursuing discovery through subpoenas to Discover Financial Services and other entities, with the deposition of Ms. Graser contemplated to occur after the discovery materials were obtained, and a scheduling process that spanned January to February 2024, including multiple proposed dates (2/28, 2/29, 3/1, 3/4 mornings) and a preferred start time of 10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m., ultimately leaning toward February 29, 2024 at 10:00 a.m., contingent on availability and the resolution of Discover\u2019s subpoena issues. The emails reflect coordination among Jessica Wiedersatz (paralegal with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm), and Lisa C. Chaffin (Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims), with references to Judge O\u2019Bryan and the need to obtain signed subpoenas and associated records in order to prepare for deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. Re: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007. On February 14, 2024, at 9:26:32 AM Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Jessica Wiedersatz regarding the Keith Graser matter. In that message, she stated that a 10:00 AM deposition would be fine and that she would note it on their calendar. Her signature block included her name, title, and contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address.\n\nEarlier correspondence shows a back-and-forth beginning in early February 2024. On February 8, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz wrote that they were still awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover Financial Services, with the subpoena due date set for February 26, 2024. She noted that they wanted to have Discover\u2019s documents prior to taking Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and, given their proof time ending March 8, 2024, the deposition should occur before then to avoid calendar conflicts if Discover\u2019s documents arrived late. She listed open dates with start times of 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM as workable, specifically noting February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only) as available, and asked for confirmation of what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon.\n\nOn February 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied, acknowledging receipt and thanking Jessica. Her signature again listed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and her title as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, with the new email address noted. \n\nThe chain also records earlier steps in the subpoena process. On February 6, 2024 at 11:42 AM, Jessica advised that she had attached a copy of the letter, subpoena duces tecum, and deposition notice that they were sending to Discover Financial Services, emphasizing that the deposition was not intended to occur at that time. Also on February 6, 2024 at 10:51 AM, Lisa C. Chaffin (Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims) wrote that the signed subpoena was attached as requested and invited questions or concerns. Earlier on February 6, 2024 at 10:31 AM, Jessica explained that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed to Discover, but Discover denied the request because it was not sent to the correct address; an updated subpoena with a corrected address for Discover was attached, and they asked that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoena so they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover. Jessica also noted that Graser\u2019s attorneys had been cc\u2019d to keep them informed.\n\nThe record then moves back to January. On January 22, 2024 at 8:34 AM, Lisa Chaffin reported that the subpoenas were signed and attached, inviting any questions or concerns. On January 18, 2024 at 4:07 PM, Jessica Wiedersatz responded to Lisa, expressing concern that they had not yet received the signed subpoenas back and that there might not be enough time to deliver the subpoenas to PNC and Discover by January 24, 2024, which was the deposition date provided. The message included cautionary notes about PDF attachments and contained the standard confidentiality notice from the Kentucky Education & Labor Cabinet communications. The email thread then appears to include a duplicated or truncated continuation of the January 18 message, ending with an incomplete sentence: \u201cHi, Lisa \u2013 As you we have not yet received the signed subpoenas back, I\u2019m concerned that there would not be enough time for us to get the subpoenas to PNC and Discover in time to respond by 1/.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the case notes document a coordinated effort among the Estate of Keith Graser\u2019s counsel and opposing counsel to coordinate Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition scheduling while pursuing subpoenas for documents from Discover Financial Services (and PNC), with discovery deadlines and deposition timing under discussion from mid-January through mid-February 2024. The latest scheduling note on February 14, 2024 confirms a 10:00 AM deposition time for February 29, contingent on availability.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser, case number Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, which concerns Keith Graser and his estate as the client, the matter Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007 unfolded through a series of discovery communications in February 2024. The communications involved Jessica Wiedersatz of Umaky Law Firm (UMAKY LAW) and Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, along with Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet and others, in the process of issuing subpoenas and scheduling depositions related to Discover Financial Services and PNC, and to prepare for Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition.\n\nThe exchange began with Jessica on January 18, 2024, explaining that signed subpoenas had not yet been returned and voicing concern that there would not be enough time to serve subpoenas on PNC and Discover by the deposition date of January 24, 2024. She indicated a deposition date for Ms. Graser had been provided on the subpoenas, and she proposed rescheduling to February 9, 2024, to allow time for signatures and for the subpoenas to be sent to PNC and Discover. She also noted plans to reschedule Ms. Graser\u2019s January 30, 2024 deposition and provided updated subpoenas with a deposition date of February 9, 2024, in the hope of obtaining the ALJ\u2019s signatures and time to send the requests.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa C. Chaffin replied with attached, signed subpoenas and invited any questions or concerns. The following days reflected ongoing coordination: on February 6, 2024, Jessica reported that they had sent a subpoena duces tecum signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan to Discover, but Discover denied the request because it had been sent to the wrong address. She attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with the correct Discover address and requested that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign it so that they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover. In the same message, Jessica cc\u2019d Keith Graser\u2019s attorneys to keep them informed.\n\nThat same day, February 6, 2024, Lisa Chaffin replied with \u201cAttached is the signed subpoena as requested,\u201d confirming she had provided the signed document. Jessica acknowledged receipt of that confirmation. The following day, February 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied with a brief note: \u201cReceived, thank you.\u201d \n\nBy February 8, 2024, Jessica noted that they were still awaiting documents from Discover and reminded that the subpoena\u2019s due date was February 26, 2024. She explained the plan to conduct Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before that date, because if they waited for Discover\u2019s documents, the attorneys\u2019 calendars might become too full to accommodate the deposition. She listed potential deposition dates that were open: February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only), with a 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM start time being acceptable but flexible.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Sarena stated that they could do either February 28 or February 29 for the deposition. Jessica then proposed February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM, asking if that time worked for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon. On February 14, 2024, Sarena replied that 10:00 AM would be fine and she would note it on their calendar, also providing her updated contact details and noting a new email address for herself.\n\nLater on February 14, 2024, Jessica confirmed that she had attached a copy of the deposition notice for the file. In the same set of messages, Sarena\u2019s contact details were updated to reflect a new email address, and Jessica signaled that the deposition notice would accompany the file.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discussed the interplay between the subpoenas, the request for documents from Discover and PNC, and the scheduling of Keith Graser\u2019s deposition, with a primary objective of securing the documents prior to Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and before the discovery-related deadlines. The deposition was ultimately scheduled for February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM, subject to availability and Discover\u2019s document production, and Jessica\u2019s and Sarena\u2019s communications culminated with the attached notice for the file.",

      "natural_language": "Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020 concerns the client, the Estate of Keith Graser, in the matter captioned Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, 2022-00007. The communications excerpted here document the efforts of counsel to schedule Keith Graser\u2019s deposition and to obtain discovery from Discover Financial Services in connection with the case. The Whaley Law Firm represents the estate, and Jessica Wiedersatz of UMAKYLaw (UMAKY?) represents the opposing side in these exchanges.\n\nThe correspondence begins with a January 18, 2024 message from Jessica Wiedersatz to Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, cc\u2019ing Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. Jessica explains that they had sent the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed to Discover, but Discover denied the request because it had not been sent to the correct address. She asks that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign an updated subpoena duces tecum with the corrected Discover address so they may again attempt to obtain Discover\u2019s records. She cc\u2019d Keith Graser\u2019s attorneys on the email.\n\nOn January 22, 2024, Lisa Chaffin replied with attached subpoenas, noting that they were signed subpoenas. Lisa\u2019s email includes her contact details as a paralegal to the Administrative Law Judge and references the confidential nature of the communication.\n\nOn February 6, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz again corresponded with Lisa Chaffin, stating that Discover had been sent the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed, but Discover denied the request because the address was incorrect. She mentions that an updated subpoena duces tecum with the correct Discover address is attached and requests that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign it so they may once again attempt to obtain records from Discover. Jessica cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. Lisa responded with the attached signed subpoena, and Jessica included the standard confidentiality notices and disclaimers typical to such correspondence, including a caution about PDF attachments potentially containing links and a formal confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn February 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt of Lisa\u2019s signed subpoena and thanked her.\n\nOn February 8, 2024, Jessica provided additional context: they were awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover, with a subpoena due date of February 26, 2024. They wanted to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before March 8, 2024, to avoid calendar conflicts should Discover\u2019s documents be received later. Jessica listed several potential deposition dates\u2014February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only)\u2014and indicated that a 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM start time would work, with flexibility. She requested to know what would work for Mr. Whaley (presumably Greg Whaley) and Mr. Koon.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Sarena responded that they could do either February 28 or February 29, and she noted her calendar details and provided the firm\u2019s contact information, including her new email address.\n\nOn February 13, 2024, Jessica suggested proceeding with February 29, if still available, and proposed a start time of 10:00 AM.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Sarena confirmed that 10:00 AM would be fine and that she would note it on the calendar. Jessica replied that the deposition notice had been attached for Sarena\u2019s file and thanked her again. The email thread includes the standard Whaley Law Firm signature block for Sarena Tuttle, including her title as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, her firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and her contact details, including her newly noted email address. Jessica\u2019s reply also includes her firm\u2019s signature block, with the UMAKYLaw contact information and a disclaimer regarding confidentiality and the risks associated with PDF attachments.\n\nIn summary, this series of communications documents the coordinated effort to obtain discovery from Discover Financial Services and to schedule Keith Graser\u2019s deposition in the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction matter (2022-00007). The parties settled on a deposition date of February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM, with the deposition notice attached to the file, and the discovery process pending the production of documents from Discover, which was anticipated by the March 8, 2024 proof time. The involved parties\u2019 attorneys and staff include Sarena M. Tuttle (Whaley Law Firm), Jessica Wiedersatz (UMAKYLaw), and Lisa C. Chaffin (Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims), with the relevant client being the Estate of Keith Graser.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. The client is the Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nIn the matter of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, 2022-00007, communications flowed between U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and The Whaley Law Firm regarding the deposition of Ms. Graser and related discovery issues. On February 14, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates apologized to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm for a prior mistake and explained that she had to change the Zoom link for Ms. Graser\u2019s upcoming deposition. Jessica asked Sarena to discard the notice she had sent earlier that day and to use the attached notice, which contains the correct Zoom link that Jessica provided below. The message included the corrected Zoom invitation block:\n\nCORRECT ZOOM LINK\n\nU'Sellis Mayer & Associates - Zoom 2 is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.\n\nTopic: Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser\nTime: Feb 29, 2024 10:00 AM Eastern Time (US and Canada)\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\nhttps://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701\n\nMeeting ID: 845 1311 7701\n\nEarlier in the chain, Jessica had sent the notice for Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and noted that she had attached a copy of the notice for file purposes. The sequence shows the following:\n\n- On February 14, 2024 at 10:38 AM, Jessica wrote to Sarena: \u201cThanks, Sarena. I have attached a copy of the notice for your file.\u201d She signed as Jessica Wiedersatz, and the subject was \u201cRE: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007.\u201d\n\n- On February 14, 2024 at 9:27 AM, Sarena responded: \u201cGood morning Jessica, 10am will be fine. I will note our calendar.\u201d Sarena\u2019s signature identifies her as a Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the stated address 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the phone numbers D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. A note in her signature indicates a new email address.\n\nEarlier scheduling discussions reflect ongoing coordination:\n\n- On February 13, 2024, at 3:04 PM, Jessica had written: \u201cHi, Sarena. Let\u2019s go with 2/29, please, if still available. How does 10AM sound?\u201d The response to that inquiry, on February 14, 2024, confirmed 10:00 AM as acceptable.\n\n- On February 12, 2024, at 9:42 AM, Sarena had proposed: \u201cWe can do the 28th or 29th.\u201d Her signature likewise shows the Whaley Law Firm contact details and the note to use the new email address.\n\n- On February 8, 2024, at 11:35 AM, Jessica had conveyed that they were awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover, with the subpoena due 2/26/24, and that they wanted Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition scheduled before the proof time ends on 3/8/24 to avoid calendar constraints. Jessica stated that start times of 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM were workable, with flexibility, and asked what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon. She listed available dates as 2/28, 2/29, 3/1, and 3/4 (morning only).\n\nThe chain also includes earlier communications about subpoenas to Discover Financial Services and related parties:\n\n- On February 7, 2024, at 11:49 AM, Sarena wrote: \u201cGood morning Jessica, We can do the 28th or 29th.\u201d This appears in the chronology as the prevailing plan around that time.\n\n- On February 6, 2024, at 11:42 AM, Jessica sent a message with attachments: a copy of the letter, subpoena duces tecum, and deposition notice to Discover Financial Services. She explained that the request for records had been denied by Discover because the request was not sent to the correct address. She asked that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign an updated subpoena duces tecum so they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover. Her message also noted that she had cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office so they would be aware of the communication. The email included Jessica\u2019s standard signature with U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates\u2019 contact information and website, and a note that the firm provides Workers\u2019 Compensation defense throughout Kentucky and Indiana since 2002.\n\n- On February 6, 2024, Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims, replied with the signed subpoenas attached, indicating that she was the Paralegal to Kimberly O\u2019Bryan, Administrative Law Judge, and providing her contact details (lisa.chaffin@ky.gov; 502/782-3919). The message included a confidentiality disclaimer typical of the correspondence from the Department of Workers\u2019 Claims.\n\n- On January 22, 2024, at 8:34 AM, Lisa C. Chaffin replied to Jessica: \u201cAttached are the signed subpoenas. Please let me know if you have any questions or additional concerns.\u201d This message carried the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\n- On January 18, 2024, at 4:07 PM, Jessica sent Lisa a message with the subject \u201cRE: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007.\u201d The email carried a caution about PDF attachments potentially containing links to malicious sites and stated: \u201cHi, Lisa \u2013 As you we have not yet received the signed subpoenas back, I\u2019m concerned that there would not be enough time for us to get the subpoenas to PNC and Discover in time to respond by 1/24/24, which was the deposition date provided on\u201d (the sentence trails off in the record). A subsequent line repeats: \u201cHi, Lisa \u2013 We sent the subpoena duces tecum Judge O\u2019Bryan had signed to Discover. Unfortunately, our request for records was denied by Discover as the request was not sent to the correct address. Please find attached an updated subpoena duces tecum with an updated address for Discover. We would ask that Judge O\u2019Bryan please sign same so that we may again attempt to obtain records from Discover.\u201d Jessica also noted that she had cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. The email signature included Jessica\u2019s position at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates and contact information.\n\n- Earlier in the chain, on January 22, 2024 and January 18, 2024, messages from Lisa Chaffin and Jessica included standard confidentiality notices and sign-offs typical of communications from the Department of Workers\u2019 Claims and the U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates firm.\n\nAdditional context from the record includes the personnel and contact details involved:\n\n- Jessica Wiedersatz is identified as a Paralegal at U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, located at 100 Mallard Creek Road, Suite 110, Louisville, KY 40207. Her phone and fax numbers are listed as part of her signature, and the firm\u2019s website is www.umakylaw.com. Her email is jwiedersatz@umakylaw.com.\n\n- Sarena M. Tuttle is identified as a Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the office address 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line is (502) 357-9971, her main line is (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. A note in her signature indicates a \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\n- The deposition notice and related correspondence refer to a deposition date previously contemplated around late February 2024, with initial possibilities including 2/28, 2/29, 3/1, and 3/4 (morning only), and a plan to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before the end of the proof time on 3/8/24.\n\n- The deposition topic noted in the Zoom notice is \u201cDepo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser,\u201d with the scheduled time of 10:00 AM on February 29, 2024 (Eastern Time). The Zoom meeting is identified by the Meeting ID 845 1311 7701, and the Join URL is https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701.\n\nIn summary, during January and February 2024, the parties worked to obtain signed subpoenas for Discover and PNC, address delivery issues with Discover, and finalize the deposition schedule for Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition in the Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction action. A corrected Zoom notice was issued on February 14, 2024 for a deposition set for February 29, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern, with the correct Zoom link and Meeting ID provided, following prior scheduling discussions that had considered 2/28, 2/29, 3/1, and 3/4 as possibilities. The email chain preserves the involved participants, their roles, contact details, and the confidentiality notices that accompany several communications.",

The subpoena \u201cdue date\u201d was 2/26/24. I just received word from Discover this morning that they have our request but cannot meet our 2/26/24 deadline. They said they anticipate being able to respond to our request by 3/28/24. I am hopeful that we will receive the records before the end of March, however, as our BRC is set for 3/27/24.\n\nIn any event, could we please push Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition out to maybe a week before our BRC? Our calendar is open as follows:\n\n3/18\n3/19\n3/20\n3/21\n\nCould you please let me know if any of those dates work on your end?

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020. Client: Estate of Keith Graser. Re: Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction 2022-00007. From Jessica Wiedersatz (jwiedersatz@umakylaw.com) to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), dated February 23, 2024 at 15:39:52 UTC, with the subject noting the Keith Graser matter.\n\nJessica explains that a subpoena duces tecum was sent to Discover Financial Services to obtain account information. The subpoena had a due date of February 26, 2024. This morning, Discover advised that they cannot meet the 2/26/24 deadline and expect to respond by March 28, 2024. Jessica notes she is hopeful the records will be received before the end of March, but she also points out that the parties\u2019 BRC is scheduled for March 27, 2024. She asks if Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition could be pushed back to about a week before the BRC and asks Sarena to check whether the following dates\u2014March 18, 19, 20, or 21\u2014might work, inviting Sarena to confirm a start time.\n\nThis message follows an earlier thread. On February 14, 2024, Jessica told Sarena that she had made a mistake and had to change the Zoom link for Ms. Graser\u2019s upcoming deposition. She asks Sarena to discard the notice she had sent earlier that day and use an attached notice with the correct Zoom link, which she provides again below. The correct Zoom details specify a session titled \u201cDepo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser,\u201d scheduled for February 29, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, hosted via Zoom. The join link is https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 with Meeting ID 845 1311 7701.\n\nEarlier in the day on February 14, Jessica had sent a copy of the deposition notice for Sarena\u2019s file. Sarena responded the same day, confirming that 10:00 AM would be fine and that she would note it on the calendar.\n\nThe chain leading up to these arrangements began on February 12, 2024, when Sarena replied that they could do the deposition on either February 28 or February 29. A prior exchange on February 13 showed Jessica proposing February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM if that date remained available. On February 7, 2024, Sarena had acknowledged receipt of the scheduling information in a brief reply. Prior to that, on February 6, 2024, Jessica had written that she and the team were sending out a subpoena duces tecum to Discover, noting that Discover had previously denied the request because it had not been sent to the correct address; she attached an updated subpoena with the corrected address and requested Judge O\u2019Bryan\u2019s signature so the records request could be reattempted, cc\u2019ing Mr. Graser\u2019s attorneys to keep them informed. Lisa C. Chaffin of the Education & Labor Cabinet had earlier provided the signed subpoenas on January 22, 2024, confirming that the subpoenas were attached and ready for use.\n\nJessica had also emphasized that Discover\u2019s production was not expected to occur before the deposition; she reminded that the deposition planning was being pursued in the context of the ongoing subpoena efforts. She noted that the parties\u2019 proof time was set to end on March 8, 2024, and they preferred to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before that deadline if possible. The proposed dates in that earlier window were February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only), with start times of either 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM, depending on what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon.\n\nThe email chain also includes standard confidentiality notices and references to the parties involved in The Whaley Law Firm, including Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, and the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky contact details. The correspondence from Lisa C. Chaffin and Lisa\u2019s earlier communications confirm a procedural path for obtaining the subpoenaed records and coordinating the deposition schedule alongside the regulatory process.\n\nIn summary, the estate\u2019s counsel sought Discover records via subpoena with a February 26 deadline, which Discover could not meet; a response was anticipated by March 28. Given the March 27 BRC date, the team proposed rescheduling Keith Graser\u2019s deposition to a date about a week before the BRC, with available slots from March 18 through March 21, 2024. Concurrently, they managed the deposition logistics for February 29, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern, including correcting a Zoom link and ensuring all notice materials were properly circulated and attached.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Estate of Keith Graser (Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020), involving Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007), the Whaley Law Firm and UMAK Law were coordinating discovery and the scheduling of a deposition in February 2024. On February 6, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz of UMAK Law informed Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, that a subpoena duces tecum had been sent to Discover Financial Services to obtain account information. Discover indicated they could not meet the subpoena\u2019s February 26, 2024 deadline and expected to respond by March 28, 2024. Jessica noted that, given the BRC (Benefit Review Conference) was set for March 27, 2024, she hoped to receive the records before the end of March and asked whether Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition could be rescheduled to a date about a week before the BRC, providing potential dates and inviting confirmation of availability.\n\nSarena responded in early February, indicating that 2/28 or 2/29 would work for the deposition. She later confirmed that a start time of 10:00 AM would be fine and asked that it be noted on their calendar. On February 13, Jessica proposed moving Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition to February 29 at 10:00 AM, if still available, and Sarena acknowledged, with confirmation that 10:00 AM would be acceptable. On February 14, Jessica again confirmed the 10:00 AM time and sent a deposition notice for Ms. Graser. She also attached a copy of the notice and, later that day, provided a corrected Zoom link for the deposition.\n\nThe deposition notice was for Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser, scheduled for February 29, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, with Join Zoom Meeting at https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 and Meeting ID 845 1311 7701. The notice indicated the matter and the Zoom parameters, and Jessica had attached the notice for the file. The Zoom invitation was titled \u201cU'Sellis Mayer & Associates \u2013 Zoom 2 is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting,\u201d and the subject referenced was the deposition of Nancy Graser in the Keith Graser case.\n\nBy February 23, 2024, Jessica reiterated that Discover had not yet provided the requested account information, confirming the February 26 due date and stating that Discover would likely respond by March 28, 2024. She noted that the BRC remained scheduled for March 27, 2024 and asked whether Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition could be moved to a date about a week before the BRC, listing open dates as 3/18, 3/19, 3/20, and 3/21, and inviting confirmation of which date would work and the preferred start time.\n\nOn February 26, 2024, Sarena replied that the deposition could be moved to March 21, 2024. This final arrangement superseded the prior February 29, 2024 deposition date, aligning the deposition with the calendar constraints and the anticipated timing of Discover\u2019s production. Throughout, Sarena\u2019s signature reflected her role and contact information at The Whaley Law Firm: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address).",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns the case Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, with the client being the Estate of Keith Graser, and the matter captioned Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007). The communications span late February and March 2024 and revolve around scheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and handling subpoenas to Discover Financial Services, including Zoom logistics and calendar constraints.\n\nOn February 6, 2024, Jessica Wiedersatz of U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates reported to Lisa C. Chaffin (Education & Labor Cabinet, Department of Workers\u2019 Claims) and to Sarena Tuttle that they had sent a subpoena duces tecum to Discover Financial Services. The subpoena had previously been signed by Judge O\u2019Bryan, but Discover denied the request because it had not been sent to the correct address. An updated subpoena duces tecum with the correct Discover address was attached, and Jessica asked that Judge O\u2019Bryan sign the updated subpoena so they could again attempt to obtain records from Discover. Jessica cc\u2019d Mr. Graser\u2019s attorney\u2019s office on this communication. The message also included the confidentiality notice typical of such correspondence.\n\nEarlier, Jessica had also attached the signed subpoena and the deposition notice to Discover as part of attempting to obtain the requested records, noting that this was done in an effort to obtain discovery and that they did not plan to depose at that time. In subsequent correspondence, Lisa Chaffin confirmed receipt of the subpoena.\n\nBy February 8, 2024, Jessica stated that they were still awaiting subpoenaed documents from Discover, with the due date on the subpoena set for February 26, 2024. She explained a desire to have Discover\u2019s documents before taking Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition and proposed scheduling Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition before March 8, 2024, to accommodate calendar constraints. Jessica offered several potential dates, specifically February 28, February 29, March 1, and March 4 (morning only), with start times of 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM, and asked for confirmation of what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon.\n\nIn a sequence of messages beginning February 12 and continuing February 14, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded that the 28th or 29th would work for deposition dates, and Jessica confirmed that a 10:00 AM start would be fine and that she would note it on the calendar. On February 14, 2024, Jessica also advised that she had sent a notice earlier that day but had to change the Zoom link for Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition, asking Sarena to discard the earlier notice and use the attached notice with the correct Zoom link. The attachment described the following Zoom details: Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser, scheduled for February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, with the Zoom link https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 and Meeting ID 845 1311 7701. Jessica labeled the previous link as needing replacement and provided the correct Zoom link information.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Sarena replied that 10:00 AM would be fine and that she would note the time on the calendar.\n\nBy February 23, 2024, Jessica reported that Discover had responded to the subpoena request earlier that morning but could not meet the February 26, 2024 deadline. Discover anticipated a response by March 28, 2024. Jessica noted that the contested deposition should be scheduled for a date roughly a week before the Firm\u2019s Case Readiness Conference (BRC), which was set for March 27, 2024. She inquired whether Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition could be scheduled on dates including March 18, 19, 20, or 21, and asked for confirmation of which dates would work for opposing counsel. She also invited Sarena to call to confirm the start time.\n\nOn February 26, 2024, Jessica confirmed that she had left the requested start time at 10:00 AM and attached the amended notice. She explained that the Zoom link information was on the notice, and she provided the same Zoom link as before (https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701) with Meeting ID 845 1311 7701. Jessica indicated that the deposition notice had been amended accordingly and requested confirmation of any needed adjustments. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle responded that the deposition in Ms. Graser\u2019s case could be moved to March 21, 2024.\n\nSarena\u2019s signature appeared at the end of her messages, identifying her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky office address and contact numbers. Jessica\u2019s communications included her role as a paralegal and her reference to U\u2019Sellis Mayer & Associates, including an embedded Zoom link for the deposition.\n\nIn summary, the case file records a series of scheduling efforts for Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007) by the Estate of Keith Graser, including: (1) attempts to obtain records from Discover via subpoena duces tecum, with Discover citing an address issue and a projected response date of March 28, 2024 and a BRC date of March 27, 2024; (2) proposed deposition dates around late February to early March 2024, with a preferred start time of 10:00 AM and alternative 2:00 PM slots, contingent on Discover\u2019s production and counsel availability; (3) adjustments to Zoom meeting logistics, including a corrected Zoom link for the deposition originally scheduled for February 29, 2024 at 10:00 AM Eastern, and a consistently used link (Meeting ID 845 1311 7701) for the deposition; and (4) a final decision to move Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition to March 21, 2024.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020, representing the Estate of Keith Graser.\n\nThe matter cited is Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction, case number 2022-00007. The client is the Estate of Keith Graser. On February 27, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, sent a message to Jessica Wiedersatz of UMAK Law (with Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon copied) explaining that Mrs. Graser\u2019s deposition would have to be cancelled for that date. Mrs. Graser has a doctor appointment on March 21, 2024 that cannot be rescheduled within a reasonable time frame. As a result, they proposed either rescheduling for March 26, 2024, or proceeding with the deposition after the BRC, with the attorneys able to inform the Administrative Law Judge that they had been awaiting a response from Discover.\n\nThe message also included contact details for Sarena Tuttle and noted a new email address for her. Specifically, her signature listed The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier into the scheduling process, on February 26, 2024, Sarena indicated she would update Mrs. Graser. Jessica Wiedersatz replied that the start time would remain 10:00 AM, but she asked to be notified if adjustments were needed and attached an amended deposition notice. Jessica also provided the Zoom link information, stating it remained the same as the previously planned link. The link was listed as https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 with Meeting ID 845 1311 7701. The communications at that time also indicated that the deposition notice contained the Zoom link and related details.\n\nIn the preceding exchanges, Jessica had confirmed her preference to move Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition to a date before the settlement conference or \u201cBRC\u201d (the BRC being scheduled for March 27, 2024). They discussed several potential dates while Discover subpoenaed documents; the subpoena to Discover requested account information with a due date of February 26, 2024. Discover advised that they could not meet the February 26 deadline and anticipated responding by March 28, 2024. The parties hoped to obtain Discover\u2019s records before the BRC, given that the BRC was set for March 27, 2024.\n\nJessica had earlier proposed moving the deposition to a date roughly a week before the BRC, noting open calendar dates of March 18, 19, 20, and 21, with a preference for a 10:00 AM or 2:00 PM start time, though she indicated flexibility on the start time. This was in the thread dated February 23, 2024, when Jessica explained Discover\u2019s anticipated response time and the desire to schedule Ms. Graser\u2019s deposition prior to the BRC, if possible.\n\nThe chronology also reveals that, on February 14, 2024, Jessica sent a corrected deposition notice and asked Sarena to discard the earlier notice and use the attached revised notice. The corrected Zoom link for the deposition was for a session titled Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser, scheduled for February 29, 2024, at 10:00 AM Eastern Time, with the Zoom invitation details again referencing the link and Meeting ID mentioned above.\n\nOn February 12 and February 13, 2024, the parties discussed available dates. Sarena indicated that the team could do the 28th or 29th of February. Jessica then suggested February 29 at 10:00 AM, asking if that time would work, and Sarena agreed that 10:00 AM would be fine. By February 14, Jessica confirmed she had attached the notice and that the correct Zoom link was provided, with Sarena acknowledging the 10:00 AM start time.\n\nIn summary, the deposition of Ms. Nancy Graser (re Keith Graser) was being coordinated amid concurrent discovery delays related to Discover\u2019s production of account information. The parties initially explored late February dates, then shifted to early March to accommodate Discover\u2019s timeline and the upcoming BRC. Ultimately, on February 27, 2024, the deposition was cancelled due to Mrs. Graser\u2019s March 21, 2024 doctor appointment that could not be reasonably rescheduled, with an option to reschedule for March 26, 2024, or to conduct the deposition after the BRC once the parties could advise the Administrative Law Judge that they had been awaiting Discover\u2019s response.",

      "natural_language": "In the Estate of Keith Graser (case caption: Estate-of-Keith-Graser-WC-12-07-2020), the client is the Estate of Keith Graser. The matter of Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007) generated a sequence of scheduling communications between Jessica Wiedersatz of UMAK Law and Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon copied on several messages.\n\nBeginning in early February 2024, Jessica informed Sarena that a subpoena duces tecum had been sent to Discover Financial Services to obtain account information. The subpoena\u2019s due date was 2/26/24, but Discover indicated they could not meet that deadline and expected to respond by 3/28/24. Jessica noted that the BRC in the case was set for 3/27/24 and proposed pushing Keith Graser\u2019s deposition to a date about a week before the BRC, asking whether dates such as 3/18, 3/19, 3/20, or 3/21 could work, and she left the start time flexible (10:00 a.m. or 2:00 p.m.). She also mentioned the start times could be adjusted and that they should call to confirm what would work for Mr. Whaley and Mr. Koon.\n\nOn 2/12/2024, Sarena replied that they could do 2/28 or 2/29. The following day, 2/13/2024, Jessica suggested proceeding with 2/29 if still available, with a 10:00 a.m. start time. On 2/14/2024, Jessica advised that she had attached a notice with the correct Zoom link and asked Sarena to use that notice, noting the link below. The \u201cCORRECT ZOOM LINK\u201d indicated that the Depo/Nancy Graser re Keith Graser was scheduled for 2/29/2024 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time, with Join Zoom Meeting at https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 and Meeting ID: 845 1311 7701.\n\nSarena confirmed on 2/14/2024 that 10:00 a.m. would be fine and she would note it on their calendar. A subsequent exchange on 2/23/2024 explained that Discover had not yet supplied the requested account information; Discover anticipated responding by 3/28/24, and the team hoped to receive the records before the end of March since the BRC was set for 3/27/24. Jessica proposed moving the deposition to dates that would occur about a week before the BRC (3/18, 3/19, 3/20, or 3/21) and asked for confirmation on which dates would work, reiterating that the start time could be adjusted.\n\nBy 2/26/2024, Sarena indicated that they could move the deposition to 3/21/2024. Jessica replied that she would leave the start time at 10:00 a.m. and attached an amended notice, asking to be informed if any adjustments were needed. She reiterated that the Zoom link information was on the notice and provided the link again. Later that day, Sarena affirmed the move to 3/21/2024, and Jessica stated she would update Mrs. Graser accordingly and attach the amended notice. The 2/28/2024 email thread shows Jessica confirming the 3/21 date but, in the same thread, a note from Sarena again reaffirming 3/21 as a possibility.\n\nOn 2/27/2024, Sarena informed Jessica that the deposition would have to be canceled because Mrs. Graser had a doctor appointment on 3/21/2024 that could not be rescheduled within a reasonable time frame. She proposed rescheduling to 3/26/2024 or moving the deposition to after the BRC, with the attorneys to inform the ALJ that they had been awaiting a response from Discover.\n\nFinally, in the closing update on 2/28/2024 at 15:45:25 +0000, Jessica notified Sarena that the deposition had been moved to 3/26/2024 at 10:00 a.m. She attached the amended notice and indicated that the Zoom link information remained the same as before, providing the Zoom link: Join Zoom Meeting at https://us06web.zoom.us/j/84513117701 with Meeting ID: 845 1311 7701. She asked Sarena to advise if the time needed to be adjusted, noting that the link had not changed from what had been used previously.\n\nThroughout the exchange, the court filing and case caption remained the same, with the case identified as Keith Graser v. Coupe Construction (2022-00007) and the client as the Estate of Keith Graser. The communications also reflect the ongoing coordination of depositions, subpoenas to Discover, and the impact of scheduling conflicts with the BRC and Mrs. Graser\u2019s medical appointments, all while preserving the Zoom meeting details and amended notices.",
