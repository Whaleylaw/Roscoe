      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022\nClient: Wayne Weber\n\nRe: The Defendant's Discovery Requests. Please review & respond to the attached.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, 10:20:18 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Wayne Weber regarding the defendant’s discovery requests. In the message, she stated that she had checked in with Bryce, who advised that Wayne and his team had everything they needed for the 11-page discovery requests. She noted that the team only required an updated Medical Authorization in order to request new or updated medical records. She also warned that Wayne’s reply to their email would not satisfy the clerks who prepare and release medical records, and she said she would resend the DocuSign email since, on occasion, it ends up in a spam folder, so he should check there as well. The email signature included Sarena M. Tuttle’s contact information and a reminder to note the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nEarlier, on Saturday, July 20, 2024, at approximately 2:15 p.m., Wayne Weber wrote back. He stated that he had received and printed the law firm’s letter and the request for production of documents—an 11-page accident investigation. He expressed that he did not know how he could go so far back in his life (they were asking for 15 years) to complete the 11-page investigation. He said he could not find the e-sign email he was asked to e-sign to authorize the firm to proceed. He asserted that if the firm needed to have something that gives them the right to act as his representative regarding the accident, they should treat his response to their letter, the investigation materials, and his reply to their two emails as his authorization to pursue and continue his representation concerning Mr. Fenwick’s alleged blatant disregard for his right of way in the accident. He closed by saying he would contact them on Monday and signed, “Thank You, Wayne Weber.”\n\nThe record also includes an email from Monday, February 12, 2024, at 10:49:37 a.m. Eastern Standard Time from Sarena Tuttle. In that message, she wrote, “Please find enclosed the Defendant James Fenwick’s discovery requests to Plaintiff. Do not be alarmed, these documents are a normal part of the litigation process. They are sent to you by the Defendant’s Attorney to find out the specifics of your claim. If you need assistance completing the requests, please contact our office.” The signature block for Sarena Tuttle repeats her role as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the same contact details and the parenthetical note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. Re: EXTERNAL MESSAGE Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick (Jefferson 23-CI-008019).\n\nOn September 10, 2024, at 04:17:45 GMT-04:00, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an external message regarding Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick (Jefferson County case 23-CI-008019) to Allison Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC. The email was addressed to Allison and copied to Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address (WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Amy Romine. In the message, Koon wrote: “Good afternoon, I do not see we ever received the responses discussed previously. Do we have any update on these?” He signed as “W. Bryce Koon, Esq.”, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with telephone and fax numbers listed as (502) 365-5043 and (502) 237-3207, respectively. The electronic message carried a standard attorney-client privileged notice instructing that it is intended only for the named recipient and, if received in error, to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to disclose or forward the information. The notice reiterated that no waiver of privilege shall be applicable.\n\nEarlier in the trail, on July 24, 2024, Allison Rief replied to Bryce Koon. In her response, sent at 1:59 PM, she explained that the discovery responses had arrived by mail, but she had been out at a mediation the previous day. She stated that she needed to actually draft the responses and obtain Wayne Weber’s verification on them, after which they should be able to forward the materials. She added that Weber is quite prompt with responses, though he does have some issues with his mail, and she expressed optimism that she could secure his verification quickly. Allison L. Rief, Attorney, was listed with the Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC firm at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with a telephone number of 502.595.6500 and a facsimile number of 502.595.6504. Her message also carried a confidentiality notice identical in substance to the one accompanying Bryce Koon’s message, warning that the transmission contains private and confidential information and outlining steps if the recipient was not the intended recipient.\n\nEarlier still, Bryce Koon had sent another external message regarding the same matter on July 24, 2024, at 1:52 PM. In that email to Allison Rief, with the subject EXTERNAL MESSAGE Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick (Jefferson 23-CI-008019) and copy to Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address, Koon stated: “Good afternoon Ms. Rief, I was reviewing my file here and I don't see that we have received your client's responses to the discovery served with the Complaint in this regard. Any update would be greatly appreciated.” The Whaley Law Firm contact details followed, including the firm’s address and phone and fax numbers. This message also contained a standard attorney-client privileged notice identical to those in the September 10 message.\n\nIn summary, the communications trace the ongoing effort to obtain Wayne Weber’s responses to discovery served with the Complaint in the Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick matter (Jefferson 23-CI-008019). Bryce Koon repeatedly requested updates on whether the client’s responses had been received, while Allison Rief indicated that the documents had arrived by mail and that she was awaiting the client’s verification after drafting the responses, with an expectation of sending them promptly once verification was obtained.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. This matter concerns client Wayne Weber in Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick, Jefferson County case 23-CI-008019.\n\nOn October 14, 2024 at 11:04:41 AM Eastern Time, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) sent an external message regarding EXTERNAL MESSAGE Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick (Jefferson 23-CI-008019) to Allison Rief (allison@dilbeckandmyers.com). In the subject line he referenced the matter, and he copied Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address (WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Amy Romine (amy@dilbeckandmyers.com). The body of the email simply asked, “Good morning Allison, Do we have any updates on this one?” The message included The Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality footer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information, with instructions to contact the firm if received in error and not to disclose or forward the content. The firm’s contact details were provided: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207.\n\nThis exchange sits in a longer email thread. On September 23, 2024 at 3:51 PM (the timestamp shows a question mark in the original, but the time is recorded as 3:51 PM), Allison Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC responded. She stated that she was not ignoring the inquiry: she had completed the client’s discovery but had been waiting on the verification page. She noted she was still awaiting that verification page and had not heard back from Mr. Fenwick yet. Allison’s signature block identified her as an attorney at Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, located at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with a telephone number of 502.595.6500 and a fax of 502.595.6504. Her email footer also carried a standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThis thread traces further back to September 10, 2024 at 4:18 PM, when Bryce Koon again wrote to Allison Rief (cc’ing Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address and Amy Romine). In his message, Koon asked, “Good afternoon, I do not see we ever received the responses discussed previously. Do we have any update on these?” He again signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., with the same firm contact details and the same confidentiality notice.\n\nEven earlier, on July 24, 2024, at 1:59 PM, Allison Rief had written a reply. She explained that, as luck would have it, documents had come in the mail while she was out at mediation the previous day. She indicated she needed to actually draft responses and obtain the client’s verification on them, after which she should be able to forward them. She added that the client is fairly prompt with responses but has some issues with mail delivery, and she expressed hopeful optimism about obtaining the verification quickly. Allison’s firm details and confidentiality notice followed.\n\nAdditionally, on July 24, 2024 at 1:52 PM, Bryce Koon (to Allison Rief, cc’ing Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address) sent an email with the subject EXTERNAL MESSAGE Wayne Weber v. James Fenwick (Jefferson 23-CI-008019). In that message, Koon stated, “Good afternoon Ms. Rief, I was reviewing my file here and I don’t see that we have received your client’s responses to the discovery served with the Complaint in this regard. Any update would be greatly appreciated.” This message also carried The Whaley Law Firm’s confidentiality disclaimer and contact information as above.\n\nIn sum, the Wayne Weber MVA case against James Fenwick has involved ongoing discovery issues, with discovery reportedly finished but awaiting the verification page, and ongoing back-and-forth among counsel across multiple dated emails (July 24, 2024; September 10, 2024; September 23, 2024), culminating in the October 14, 2024 request for updates from Bryce Koon. The communications repeatedly reference the discovery responses, verification pages, and Fenwick’s lack of timely responses, while noting mail delivery issues affecting Fenwick’s responsiveness.",

Fenwick matter in the Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022 file. The thread runs between Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, with cc’d recipients including Amy Romine and a Filevine project email address for Wayne Weber.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Allison L. Rief sent an email to Bryce Koon (with Amy Romine and Wayne Weber’s Filevine project email address cc’d) regarding Weber v. Fenwick. She stated that their verification page had finally arrived and that their answers to discovery requests were attached. The message included Allison’s standard confidential-notice language.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison followed up, asking Bryce to let her know if there were potential deposition dates after the new year, noting that she did not care whether the deposition was in person or via Zoom. She added that if Fenwick’s deposition was planned, it would need to be conducted via Zoom since Fenwick lives in Bloomington, and she invited Bryce to propose dates for Mr. Weber and to get back to her. The email again carried Allison’s confidential-notice.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison sent another message asking to check back on the above matter and requesting potential deposition dates. She said she would coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability once dates were proposed.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied, apologizing for the delay in getting back to them. He stated that they were available on March 26 and 27, or during the first week of April, and invited the recipients to call if more dates were needed to work things out.\n\nThe above exchanges reflect the ongoing scheduling discussions for depositions in the Weber v. Fenwick matter, including the preference for Zoom deposition of Mr. Fenwick due to his Bloomington residence and the coordination of dates with Wayne Weber.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022 concerns the Weber v. Fenwick matter, with client Wayne Weber. The communication thread consists of email exchanges between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck and Myers, focusing on scheduling the deposition of Mr. Fenwick. Mr. Fenwick resides in Bloomington, so if his deposition proceeds, it would need to be conducted by Zoom. The chain includes multiple participants copied on the messages, including Amy Romine, Wayne Weber’s Filevine project address, and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, wrote that their verification page had arrived and attached were their answers to discovery requests. She also noted the standard private and confidential nature of the transmission and the need to handle any receipt in error appropriately.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison followed up to discuss scheduling depositions after the new year. She stated she did not care whether the proceedings were in person or via Zoom, but if a deposition of Mr. Fenwick was planned, it would have to be conducted by Zoom due to his Bloomington residence. She suggested coordinating with Mr. Weber to propose dates and asked to be informed.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison asked for potential deposition dates and offered to coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability. She again noted the confidentiality of the transmission.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and offered to provide additional dates if needed. He included his firm’s contact information and reiterated the confidentiality provisions typical of such communications.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, at about 9:56 AM, Allison responded that the proposed dates generally work for her and asked whether they planned to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, noting she would need to confirm Mr. Fenwick’s availability.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 10:16 AM, Bryce Koon replied that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, closing the thread for the time being. The exchange, copied to the file and related parties, reflects ongoing coordination between counsel about the deposition timetable in Weber v. Fenwick.\n\nContact details referenced in the communications include The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with Bryce Koon, Esq., reachable at (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207; and Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with Allison L.

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. This record consolidates a sequence of email communications regarding Weber v. Fenwick, with the subject line “Re: Weber v. Fenwick,” involving counsel Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, along with related CCs.\n\nThe earliest material note in this trace is an email from Bryce Koon dated March 4, 2025 at 10:16:41 a.m. Eastern Time, sent to Allison Rief and CC’d recipients including Amy Romine, Sarena Tuttle, and the Wayne Weber Filevine project address. In that message, Koon stated, “I think we will wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition.” He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, noting the firm’s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message carried the confidentiality disclaimer typical for privileged communications, noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and advising that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nPrior to that, Allison Rief had replied to Bryce on March 4, 2025, at 9:56 a.m., with the subject line “Re: FW: Weber v. Fenwick.” In her message, she wrote, “Those dates generally work for me. Are you planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition? I will need to confirm with him that he can be available.” Her signature identified her as an attorney with Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, listing the firm’s address at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; telephone 502.595.6500; fax 502.595.6504. A confidentiality notice accompanied the message.\n\nThe thread then shows the March 3, 2025 correspondence from Bryce Koon, this time at 4:38 p.m. Eastern Time, addressed to Allison Rief with Amy Romine and the Wayne Weber Filevine project address CC’d. Koon apologized for the delayed response and stated, “We are available March 26 and 27th, or the first week of April. If you need more dates, just give me a call and we can work it out.” He signed again as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the same contact details and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier in the chain, Allison Rief had written on February 20, 2025 at 3:49 p.m., addressing the matter of potential deposition dates. She wrote, “Checking back on the below. Let me know if you all have some potential depo dates and I will get with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability.” Her signature then again listed Dilbeck and Myers’ contact information and included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nEven earlier, on December 5, 2024 at 3:23 p.m., Allison Rief sent a message with the subject “FW: Weber v. Fenwick.” She began, “Good afternoon, Coming back to this one – want to see about scheduling depositions sometime after the new year?” She added that she did not care whether depositions were in person or via Zoom, but if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition were to be taken, it would need to be via Zoom since he lives in Bloomington. She proposed coordinating dates with Mr. Weber and asked to get back to her. Her signature again listed the Dilbeck and Myers contact details, and the standard confidentiality notice accompanied the email.\n\nThe surrounding chronology also includes a prior email from Allison Rief dated October 21, 2024 at 2:24 p.m., with the subject “Weber v. Fenwick.” In that message, she wrote, “Hi Bryce, Our verification page finally arrived today. Attached please find our answers to discovery requests.” She closed with her signature from Dilbeck and Myers and the usual confidentiality notice, and CC’d Amy Romine and the Wayne Weber Filevine project address.\n\nCollectively, these notes document a back-and-forth among counsel about scheduling depositions in Weber v. Fenwick, with repeated consideration of whether Mr. Fenwick’s deposition should be conducted by Zoom (due to his residence in Bloomington), and with proposed dates including late March, late March into early April, and the intention to coordinate dates with Mr. Weber. By March 4, 2025, the parties appeared to be aligning on available windows, though Bryce Koon subsequently indicated that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition. The communications are consistently accompanied by formal confidentiality notices and reflect ongoing coordination via both direct emails and the Filevine project channel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. This file documents a series of email communications concerning the Weber v. Fenwick matter, with the focus on scheduling depositions and coordinating mediation, involving the Whaley Law Firm and the Dilbeck & Myers firm, and with Wayne Weber listed in the Filevine project email address.\n\nThe note begins with an email from October 21, 2024. Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, wrote to Bryce Koon and cc’d Amy Romine and others that “Our verification page finally arrived today. Attached please find our answers to discovery requests,” referring to Weber v. Fenwick. Allison’s address and contact details followed: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502.595.6500; fax 502.595.6504. The cc also included Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 – Filevine Project Email Address and the Wayne Weber file in the Filevine system.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison responded to Bryce and others about scheduling depositions after the new year. She stated she did not have a preference for in-person versus Zoom, but if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition was needed, it would have to be conducted via Zoom because he lives in Bloomington. She asked to get some potential dates together with Mr. Weber and to get back to her. Allison again provided her contact information and the standard confidentiality notice that accompanied their communications.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison followed up asking the recipients to provide potential deposition dates so she could coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and he offered to call if more dates were needed. His message also included his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, KY, and the standard attorney-email confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe next day, March 4, 2025, at approximately 9:56 a.m., Allison replied that the dates proposed generally worked for her and asked whether the team planned to depose Mr. Fenwick, noting she would need to confirm his availability. She again provided her signature block and the confidentiality notice.\n\nShortly afterward, at 10:17 a.m. on March 4, Bryce responded that he thought they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, indicating a pause or reconsideration of the deposition timing. His message included his Whaley Law Firm contact information and the usual confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAt around 10:34 a.m. on March 4, Allison replied, “Sounds good. Then let’s go ahead and schedule for March 26th. 10:00 work for you all?” She added that the deposition could be conducted via Zoom or in person, that Kentuckiana Court Reporters would be used, and that she could issue a notice if the arrangement worked.\n\nSeparately, on the same day, March 4, 2025, at 10:42:53 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mrs. Allison Rief with the subject “Re: Weber v. Fenwick.” In her note, she stated that March 26th was not available due to a mediation on that date and asked if they could look at the following week instead. She provided her contact details, including her move to a new email address at Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and direct line (502) 357-9971, main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104. The email also listed the Filevine project email address for Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 as a cc recipient.\n\nCollected together, these messages show a coordinated effort among the Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers to schedule the deposition of Mr. Fenwick (the defendant in the Weber v. Fenwick case) around late March 2025, with considerations about mediation scheduling, the method of deposition (Zoom versus in-person), the use of Kentuckiana Court Reporters, and the need to confirm Mr. Fenwick’s availability. The communications also reflect the involvement of multiple parties in the Weber case, including Wayne Weber as the client, and indicate ongoing coordination through both email and the Filevine project channel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. The following notes summarize a series of email exchanges between counsel regarding scheduling depositions in Weber v. Fenwick, with the focus on Mr. Fenwick’s deposition and coordination with Wayne Weber.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, wrote to Bryce Koon regarding Weber v. Fenwick. Her message stated, “Hi Bryce, Our verification page finally arrived today. Attached please find our answers to discovery requests.” The email was sent to Bryce Koon and copied to Amy Romine, the Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 Filevine project email address, and Sarena Tuttle; it included the firm’s standard confidentiality notice.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison Rief sent another email about the same matter. The subject line was “FW: Weber v. Fenwick.” In that message she asked, “Good afternoon, Coming back to this one – want to see about scheduling depositions sometime after the new year? I do not care if we do this in person or via Zoom, but if you plan to take Mr. Fenwick’s depo, then it would need to be Zoom since he lives in Bloomington. If you want to get some dates together with Mr. Weber and get back to me.” The email again carried the firm’s confidential notice and then Allison’s signature block with contact information.\n\nFast forward to February 20, 2025, Allison checked back in regarding potential deposition dates. Her message read, “Checking back on the below. Let me know if you all have some potential depo dates and I will get with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability.” This communication also included her standard confidentiality notice and signature.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied to Allison. He wrote, “Good afternoon counsel, My apologies for just getting back to you on this one. We are available March 26 and 27th, or the first week of April. If you need more dates, just give me a call and we can work it out.” The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm and included Bryce’s office contact information and the same protective notice.\n\nThe following day, March 4, 2025, Allison responded. In her note, she asked, “Those dates generally work for me. Are you planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition? I will need to confirm with him that he can be available.” This message again carried the confidentiality notice and Allison’s standard signature block.\n\nLater on March 4, 2025, Allison sent another email in the thread with the subject line “Re: Weber v. Fenwick.” She wrote, “Sounds good. Then let’s go ahead and schedule for March 26th. 10:00 work for you all? I can do this via Zoom or in person, and we use Kentuckiana Court Reporters. I can get a notice out if that all works.” This message, too, included the confidentiality notice and Allison’s professional contact details, consistent with her prior communications.\n\nIn sum, the communications trace a coordinated effort across late 2024 to early 2025 to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, with consideration of Zoom versus in-person format due to Mr. Fenwick’s Bloomington residence, the availability windows of March 26–27 or the first week of April, and the practical steps to set up notices through Kentuckiana Court Reporters, pending confirmation of Mr. Fenwick’s availability and the final scheduling of the deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. The communication log concerns the matter Weber v. Fenwick, with The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager) coordinating with Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC (Allison L. Rief, attorney) regarding depositions and scheduling for the underlying motor vehicle accident case in which Wayne Weber is the client. The email thread includes multiple recipients and a Filevine project email address used for the matter, and the correspondence contains standard confidentiality notices in several messages. The sender lists for Sarena and Allison include their contact details, and Sarena notes a new email address in her signature.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Allison L. Rief, attorney for Dilbeck and Myers, wrote to Bryce Koon and others that their verification page had arrived and that their discovery responses were attached. The message identified the Weber v. Fenwick case and included Allison’s professional contact information and a standard confidentiality notice. The message was forwarded to Bryce Koon and copy-couriers included Amy Romine and the Wayne Weber Filevine project email address.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison followed up with a message asking to schedule depositions sometime after the new year. She stated that she did not care whether the depositions occurred in person or via Zoom, but noted that if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition were to be taken, it would need to be conducted via Zoom because he lives in Bloomington. She asked to get some dates together with Mr. Weber and to report back. This email again carried the confidentiality notice and was sent to Bryce Koon and others.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison asked for potential deposition dates and indicated she would coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability. This message also carried the confidentiality notice and was directed to the same general recipients.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon responded that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and invited contact if more dates were needed. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and included standard attorney-client privileged notice language.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, at 9:56 AM, Allison replied that those dates generally worked for her and asked whether they were planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, noting she would need to confirm his availability. She again included the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAlso on March 4, 2025, at 10:34 AM, Allison sent a follow-up stating, “Sounds good. Then let’s go ahead and schedule for March 26th. 10:00 work for you all? I can do this via Zoom or in person, and we use Kentuckiana Court Reporters. I can get a notice out if that all works.” The prior message from Bryce at 10:17 AM had indicated availability on March 26 or 27 or the first week of April, and the parties appeared to be aiming to schedule for March 26 at 10:00 with Zoom or in-person format.\n\nAt 10:42:53 AM on March 4, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded to Allison, indicating that March 26th is not available due to a mediation already scheduled on that day, and requesting that scheduling shift to the following week. Sarena provided her contact details again: Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting this as her new email address. She also included the firm’s New Email Address notice in her signature and reiterated that the “Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address” was cc’d on the thread.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the emails featured standard confidentiality notices stating that the communications are private and confidential, containing guidance that if received in error, the recipient should notify the sender and refrain from disclosing or distributing the information. The cc’d recipients included the Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 Filevine project email address and the file-related contact listed as part of the matter.\n\nIn summary, the deposition planning for Weber v. Fenwick evolved from an intention to schedule for late March 2025, with the option of Zoom versus in-person delivery and a proposed 10:00 a.m. time on March 26, to a conflict due to an existing mediation on March 26, and a request to shift the deposition to the following week. The thread captures ongoing coordination among The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers, with Mr. Fenwick’s availability being coordinated through multiple emails, and it documents the preference for Zoom deposition where Mr. Fenwick resides in Bloomington. The matter remains subject to final scheduling decisions based on availability after the mediation constraint on March 26.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. This notes the Weber v. Fenwick matter, with Wayne Weber as the principal client in a motor-vehicle-accident case arising from the January 1, 2022 incident.\n\nIn late 2024 and continuing into early 2025, counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers worked to schedule depositions in Weber v. Fenwick. On December 5, 2024, Allison L. Rief, attorney for Dilbeck & Myers, sent a message asking to move depositions to sometime after the new year. She stated that she did not care whether depositions were in person or via Zoom, but she indicated that if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition would be taken she would need to coordinate accordingly. The email included standard confidentiality notices and listed the addressees: Bryce Koon and Amy Romine, with Wayne Weber’s Filevine project email address WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and the signature for Allison Rief from Dilbeck & Myers at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone and fax numbers.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, at 3:49 p.m., Allison Rief replied to the thread, saying, “Checking back on the below. Let me know if you all have some potential depo dates and I will get with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability.” Her message was copied to Bryce Koon, Amy Romine, and Wayne Weber’s Filevine contact.\n\nBetween March 3 and March 4, 2025, the deposition scheduling continued. On March 3, 2025, at 4:38 p.m., Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm) wrote to Allison Rief (and others) that they were available for March 26 or 27, or the first week of April, and invited further date options if needed. Bryce’s message noted that the firm could coordinate further dates by phone.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, starting with Allison Rief’s reply at 9:56 a.m., she acknowledged that the suggested dates generally worked for her but asked whether Mr. Fenwick would be available for deposition, requiring confirmation of his availability. Bryce Koon followed at 10:17 a.m. with, “I think we will wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition.” At 10:34 a.m., Allison replied, “Sounds good. Then let’s go ahead and schedule for March 26th. 10:00 work for you all? I can do this via Zoom or in person, does not matter, and we use Kentuckiana Court Reporters. I can get a notice out if that all works.” Sarena M. Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm’s litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, replied at 10:43 a.m.: “Good morning Mrs. Rief, Unfortunately March 26th is not available. We have a mediation on the calendar that day. Can we please look at the following week?” The thread continued with further exchanges: at 1:56 p.m. on March 4, Allison indicated willingness to schedule the deposition in the following week; and at 1:59 p.m., Sarena reaffirmed contact details and new email address.\n\nConcluding the exchange, Sarena’s message reiterated the April scheduling option that had been proposed earlier in the thread. She wrote, “Awesome. Let’s do April 1st to avoid any motion hour issues. 10 a.m. or 1 p.m. start is fine. We can do Zoom or In Person at your office. Once we receive your notice, we will let Mr. Weber know to be there with bells on.” Her contact information followed: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; with the note “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nThroughout the thread, the parties’ communications referenced use of Kentuckiana Court Reporters for deposition reporting, and the option to conduct depositions either via Zoom or in person. The emails also included standard confidentiality notices typical of attorney communications, and Wayne Weber’s MVA-related contact address appeared in the thread as Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The note captures the evolving scheduling discussions, including the conflict on March 26 caused by a mediation, the consideration of alternate dates (late March or early April), and the final proposal to hold deposition activities on April 1, with the possibility of a 10:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. start time, via Zoom or at the office, with Mr. Weber expected to attend.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022\nClient: Wayne Weber\n\nThis record is a sequence of email correspondence about scheduling depositions and a mediation in the matter Weber v. Fenwick, involving Wayne Weber and counsel from Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, and The Whaley Law Firm. The chain begins with a message from Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck & Myers and runs through early March 2025, with multiple participants and dates referenced.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Allison L. Rief sent an email to Bryce Koon with the subject Weber v. Fenwick. She noted that their verification page had finally arrived and attached their answers to discovery. The email was copied to Amy Romine and to Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address, and it included Allison’s standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison wrote again to Bryce and others regarding depositions in Weber v. Fenwick. She asked if there were potential dates for depositions after the new year and stated she did not care whether the depositions were in person or via Zoom. However, she added that if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition was to be taken, it would need to be conducted by Zoom because he resides in Bloomington. She suggested coordinating dates with Mr. Weber and asked to be told when they wanted to proceed.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison followed up, asking for potential deposition dates and indicating she would coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that the Whaley Law Firm was available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and asked to call if more dates were needed.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, at 9:56 AM, Allison replied that the dates they were considering generally worked for her and asked whether they planned to depose Mr. Fenwick, noting she would need to confirm his availability.\n\nAt 10:17 AM on March 4, 2025, Bryce responded that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition.\n\nAt 10:34 AM on March 4, 2025, Allison wrote, “Sounds good. Then let’s go ahead and schedule for March 26th. 10:00 work for you all? I can do this via Zoom or in person, does not matter, and we use Kentuckiana Court Reporters. I can get a notice out if that all works.” She included her firm’s address and contact information and reiterated the confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 10:43 AM on March 4, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, “Good morning Mrs. Rief, Unfortunately March 26th is not available. We have a mediation on the calendar that day. Can we please look at the following week?” Sarena also provided her contact details, including her direct line D: (502) 357-9971, office line O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and noted her new email address in the signature.\n\nEarlier on March 4, 2025, at 10:34 AM, Allison had proposed the March 26th date with a 10:00 time and offered Zoom or in-person formats through Kentuckiana Court Reporters, with a notice to be issued following confirmation.\n\nIn addition, an email from Bryce Koon at 4:38 PM on March 4, 2025 stated, “Good afternoon counsel, My apologies for just getting back to you on this one. We are available March 26 and 27th, or the first week of April. If you need more dates, just give me a call and we can work it out.” This message also included Bryce’s firm contact details and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier in the thread, at 9:56 AM on March 4, 2025, Allison had asked whether they were planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, noting she needed to confirm his availability.\n\nThis sequence shows ongoing discussions about scheduling Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, with the parties initially considering March 26 (a date that was later deemed unavailable due to a mediation on that day), and then exploring the last week of March or the first week of April as alternatives. The participants consistently discussed logistics (Zoom vs. in-person deposition, the use of Kentuckiana Court Reporters for notices) and kept Wayne Weber and his records in the loop via file-sharing and CCs. Each email contained a confidentiality disclaimer, informing recipients not to disclose or rely on the information if received in error.\n\nNotes on contact and format:\n- Key participants included Allison L. Rief (Attorney, Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm), Bryce Koon (Esq., The Whaley Law Firm), and Wayne Weber (client). \n- CC’d in multiple messages were Amy Romine and “Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address.”\n- The proposed deposition topics related to Mr. Fenwick and the procedural details included whether the deposition would be conducted via Zoom (preferred if Fenwick resides in Bloomington) or in person, and which court reporting service would be used (Kentuckiana Court Reporters).\n- The dates explicitly referenced in the thread include March 26, 2025; March 27, 2025; the first week of April 2025 (including March 31 and April 1 as possible days); and a mediation on March 26, 2025, that rendered March 26 unavailable.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. Re: Weber v. Fenwick. This matter involves a string of communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers about scheduling Mr. Fenwick’s deposition in Weber v. Fenwick and arranging mediation, with Wayne Weber as the client. The participants include Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address), Allison L. Rief, Attorney at Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC (address: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504), and W. Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm) along with the Wayne Weber Filevine project email address WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The mediation and deposition scheduling discussions also reference Kentuckiana Court Reporters for deposition services.\n\nThe exchange began with a February 20, 2025 email from Allison Rief at Dilbeck & Myers asking for potential deposition dates and to confirm Mr. Fenwick’s availability, with copies to Bryce Koon, Amy Romine, and the Wayne Weber Filevine project address. On March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that they were available for March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and offered to provide additional dates if needed. In a March 4, 2025 thread, Allison asked whether they were planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition and noted she would need to confirm his availability.\n\nLater on March 4, 2025, Bryce replied that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition. In response, Allison asked if March 26 at 10:00 a.m. would work and stated she could conduct the deposition via Zoom or in person, using Kentuckiana Court Reporters, and that she could issue a notice if that arrangement was acceptable. At about 10:43 a.m., Sarena responded that March 26 was not available due to a mediation on the calendar that day and asked to look at the following week.\n\nSubsequently, Sarena and Allison discussed alternative dates for the deposition, culminating in an exchange where Sarena suggested April 1 as the preferable date to avoid motion-hour issues, with a start time of either 10:00 a.m. or 1:00 p.m. and the option to conduct the deposition by Zoom or in person at Allison’s office; she added that once a notice was received, Mr. Weber would be informed to attend. In reply, Allison indicated she was available the first week of April, though noting it was spring break week and she did not have travel plans; she suggested Monday the 31st or Tuesday, April 1st, and asked to be told which day and time so a notice could be issued.\n\nThroughout the chain, the parties discussed whether to depose Mr. Fenwick and whether to proceed with mediation as scheduled on March 26, 2025. The messages show the parties’ willingness to accommodate either in-person or Zoom depositions, the use of Kentuckiana Court Reporters for court reporting, and the need to issue notices once dates were confirmed.\n\nThe complete exchange includes standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of such communications, cautioning recipients not to disclose or rely on the transmitted information if received in error, and identifying recipients as the named recipients only. The thread also references the Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 Filevine project address for the case file.",

These notices appeared multiple times across the thread.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied, “Good morning Crystal, Yes, Please send any records you may have. We greatly appreciate your assistance.” She signed as before, with her contact details and a note to use her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nAt 12:10?

Whichever is easiest for you.” The thread then included warnings about phishing common to outside-system emails.\n\nFinally, at 17:17:09 +0000, Crystal Morin sent a brief reply: “Thank you!” with the same professional contact details and the signature block.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the parties discussed sending the medical records for Wayne Weber, the mutual patient, with Crystal noting the mismatch between requested dates and records on file and confirming the patient’s identifying details (Wayne Weber, DOB 07/13/1947) and the procedure dates on file (5/30/2023 and 07/31/2023). The thread also recorded the preferred method of transmission (email versus fax) and included standard external-email warnings and confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "The Weber v. Fenwick case (Wayne Weber is the client in a motor vehicle accident case filed in 2022) features a detailed exchange between counsel about scheduling Mr. Fenwick’s deposition. The email chain includes Allison L. Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, and W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with multiple recipients and cc’d parties, including Amy Romine, a Wayne Weber Filevine project email address, Sarena Tuttle, and Jennifer Styles, all under standard confidentiality notices.\n\nThe latest thread begins in December 2024, when Allison Rief wrote that she would like to schedule depositions sometime after the new year. She noted that the deposition of Mr. Fenwick would need to be conducted by Zoom, since Fenwick lives in Bloomington, and asked Bryce to propose dates that could work for Mr. Weber as well. This followed an October 21, 2024 email in which Allison reported that their verification page had arrived and attached discovery responses.\n\nIn February 2025, Allison followed up, asking for potential deposition dates and requesting that Bryce check Mr. Fenwick’s availability. Bryce replied on March 3, 2025, indicating that they were available March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and inviting them to call if more dates were needed.\n\nThe next exchange on March 4, 2025 shows a bit of back-and-forth. Allison acknowledged that the dates Bryce proposed generally worked for her and asked whether they intended to depose Mr. Fenwick, noting that she would need to confirm his availability. Bryce replied later that day that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Allison informed Bryce that she had canceled with Kentuckiana and that they would be rescheduling. She provided a list of available dates she could consider: April 14, 15, and 16; April 22 and 23; April 24 in the afternoon; April 25 and 28; May 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16. She noted that she could look at additional dates if needed and asked Bryce to let her know which dates worked on his end. The email also carried the customary confidentiality notices.\n\nAcross the thread, the communications consistently reference the Weber v. Fenwick matter, the 01/01/2022 motor vehicle accident, the plan to depose Mr. Fenwick (with Zoom favored due to his Bloomington residence), and the coordination of dates involving Mr. Weber, along with the shared Filevine project address and the various cc’d participants.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber.\n\nThis matter concerns the Weber v. Fenwick case, and a chain of email communications between the Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers over depositions and scheduling. The thread begins with an October 21, 2024 email from Allison Rief of Dilbeck & Myers to Bryce Koon, with other recipients copied, noting that their verification page had arrived and that their discovery responses were attached. The message is part of the Weber MVA matter (Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022) and includes the Filevine project email address WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com in the CC line. Allison’s message does not raise a scheduling issue at that time, but confirms completion of discovery responses.\n\nOn December 5, 2024, Allison again wrote regarding Weber v. Fenwick, stating that they wanted to schedule depositions sometime after the new year. She indicated she did not care whether the deposition was in person or via Zoom, but noted that if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition was to be taken, it would need to be conducted via Zoom because he resides in Bloomington. She suggested arranging dates with Mr. Weber and asked to be informed of what arrangements could be made. This message also included the standard confidentiality notice common to those emails.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Allison checked back on the scheduling and asked for potential deposition dates, noting she would coordinate with Mr. Fenwick regarding his availability. The confidentiality notice appeared at the end of this message as well.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and invited contact if more dates were needed. This message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm and CC’d Amy Romine, Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address, and Sarena Tuttle, with the subject Re: FW: Weber v. Fenwick. A standard attorney-client confidentiality notice followed.\n\nThe following day, March 4, 2025, Allison responded that the proposed dates generally worked for her and asked whether they planned to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, noting she would need to confirm his availability. This email, too, carried the confidentiality notice.\n\nAlso on March 4, 2025 at 10:17 AM, Bryce Koon sent another message stating, “I think we will wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition,” and included the same CC list as before along with a disclaimer about privilege. This message indicated a shift in planning to potentially delay scheduling the deposition.\n\nEarlier on March 4, 2025 at 9:56 AM, Allison had written confirming that those dates generally worked for her, reiterating the need to confirm Mr. Fenwick’s availability.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 at 3:41 PM, Allison wrote that they had canceled with Kentuckiana and would be rescheduling, listing open dates: April 14, 15, 16; April 22, 23; April 24 in the afternoon; April 25 and 28; May 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16. The email again included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025 at 10:12:26 AM (GMT-04:00), Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Mrs. Rief. She confirmed that April 15th was perfect for them and that they could leave all other terms—time and location—unchanged. Sarena provided her contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting that this is her new email address. The message was signed with her name and title.\n\nIn summary, the communications document a concerted effort from October 2024 through March 2025 to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition in the Weber v. Fenwick matter, including discussions of in-person versus Zoom deposition (due to Mr. Fenwick’s Bloomington residence), anticipated dates in late March to May 2025, and an explicit acceptance of April 15, 2025 by the Weber team. The thread shows multiple parties coordinating through the Filevine project email account, with repeated confidentiality notices accompanying each email.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. Re: Weber v. Fenwick. The correspondence centers on scheduling depositions in the Weber v. Fenwick matter, with the primary participants being Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, Allison Rief of Dilbeck and Myers, and attorney Bryce Koon, along with Wayne Weber (MVA 01/01/2022) via a Filevine project email address.\n\nOn March 27, 2025 at 10:12:26 a.m. (Eastern), Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mrs. Allison Rief. In her message she thanked Allison and stated that April 15th is perfect for their side and that they could leave everything else—time and location—unchanged. Sarena provided her contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and noted the email address as the new contact address.\n\nEarlier, on March 26, 2025 (time indicated as 3:41?PM in the thread), Allison Rief replied. She informed Bryce that she had canceled with Kentuckiana and told them they would be rescheduling. She listed dates and times she had available: April 14, 15, and 16; April 22 and 23; April 24 in the afternoon; April 25 and 28; and May 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16. She added that she could look at more dates if needed and asked Bryce to let her know if there was any schedule work on his end. Allison included her standard confidentiality notice, reminding recipients not to disclose or act on the information if they were not the intended recipient.\n\nThe thread shows an earlier exchange on March 4, 2025. Bryce Koon sent an email at 10:17 a.m. to Allison Rief, cc’ing Amy Romine, Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 – Filevine Project Email Address, and Sarena Tuttle. In his message, he stated, “I think we will wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition.” He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville contact information, and included the usual attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 9:56 a.m. on March 4, 2025, Allison Rief replied to Bryce. She noted that the dates generally worked for her and asked whether they planned to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, adding that she would need to confirm Mr. Fenwick’s availability.\n\nOn March 3, 2025 at 4:38 p.m., Bryce Koon replied to Allison, cc’ing Amy Romine and the Wayne Weber Filevine address. He wrote that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and offered to provide additional dates if needed after a phone call to coordinate.\n\nEarlier still, on February 20, 2025 at 3:49? p.m., Allison Rief had written to the group, asking for potential deposition dates and promising to check Mr. Fenwick’s availability once dates were proposed.\n\nA prior thread began on December 5, 2024 at 3:23 p.m., when Allison Rief wrote to Bryce Koon (cc’ing Amy Romine and the Wayne Weber Filevine address). She asked about scheduling depositions sometime after the new year and indicated she did not care whether the deposition was in person or via Zoom; however, if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition were to occur, it would need to be conducted via Zoom because he lives in Bloomington. She asked the recipients to propose dates to coordinate with Mr. Weber and to get back to her.\n\nThe earliest item in the sequence, dated October 21, 2024 at 2:24 p.m., shows Allison Rief informing Bryce Koon that their verification page had arrived and that the attached documents contained their answers to discovery requests.\n\nIn summary, the parties have been coordinating deposition scheduling for Mr. Fenwick (and related discovery) across several months. The key points include: (1) a December 2024 request to arrange depositions after the new year with a preference for Zoom if Mr. Fenwick testifies; (2) a February 2025 follow-up requesting potential dates and Fenwick’s availability; (3) early March 2025 proposals of availability from Bryce (March 26–27 or the first week of April) with an offer to discuss additional dates; (4) late March 2025 feedback from Allison proposing multiple dates in April and May; and (5) a March 27, 2025 reply from Sarena confirming that April 15 works and that time and location could remain as previously arranged. The thread also shows standard confidentiality language repeatedly appearing in the email notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. This matter concerns Weber v. Fenwick, with the file labeled Wayne Weber MVA 01/01/2022 and corresponding Filevine project communications.\n\nIn late February and March of 2025, the parties and their counsel coordinated the scheduling of depositions in the Weber v. Fenwick case. The practice groups involved were The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, and Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, represented by Allison L. Rief, an attorney. The communication loop also included W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, along with other recipients and the Wayne Weber Filevine project email address. The exchanges were conducted in professional emails that carried standard private and confidentiality notices.\n\nThe thread began with a message from Allison Rief on February 20, 2025, asking the other side to provide potential deposition dates so she could coordinate with Mr. Fenwick about his availability. Bryce Koon replied on March 3, 2025, indicating that they were available on March 26 and 27, or the first week of April, and inviting the others to propose additional dates if needed. On March 4, 2025, Allison responded that the dates Bryce proposed generally worked for her, and she asked whether they were planning to take Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, noting she would need to confirm his availability. Bryce followed that same day with a comment that they would wait to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition. Allison replied again on March 4, 2025, that those dates generally worked for her, and she asked for confirmation to proceed or adjust.\n\nPrior to these scheduling discussions, the thread also included a prior email dating from December 5, 2024, in which Allison asked about scheduling depositions sometime after the new year and whether the deposition could be conducted by Zoom if Mr. Fenwick’s deposition were to be taken, given concerns about in-person versus remote arrangements. The message ended with a fragment indicating that if Zoom was used, some further detail followed (the line ends with “Zoom s,” suggesting the text was incomplete).\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Allison provided a more concrete set of potential deposition windows: April 14, 15, and 16; April 22 and 23; April 24 in the afternoon; April 25 and 28; and May 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16. In response, Sarena Tuttle on March 27, 2025, at 10:12 AM confirmed that April 15th was perfect for Weber’s side and indicated that they would keep everything else as to time and location. She also reiterated the case details and provided her contact information, noting a new email address for future correspondence. Her reply included her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct and office phone numbers and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the parenthetical note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nShortly thereafter, at 11:11 AM on March 27, 2025, Allison Rief sent a message attaching a new deposition notice for Mr. Weber, stating that the notice had been filed with the court that day. In her message, she echoed the confidentiality warning typical of such transmissions. The notice attached to the email signaled the formal initiation of Weber’s deposition scheduling in the court system.\n\nIn parallel with the scheduling discussions, Bryce Koon indicated that they were waiting to schedule Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, and he provided the Whaley Law Firm contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. Allison Rief, in her responses, carried the Dilbeck and Myers contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504. The participants also used the Wayne Weber Filevine Project Email Address: WayneWeberMVAZ4293302@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com for project communications, and the case’s scope remains Weber v. Fenwick.\n\nIn sum, the parties engaged in a coordinated effort to schedule depositions in the Weber v. Fenwick matter, with Weber’s deposition notice being filed with the court on March 27, 2025, and April 15 identified as the preferred date by Weber’s side. The exchange documents a sequence of proposed date windows, a temporary postponement of scheduling Mr. Fenwick’s deposition, and the formal filing of Weber’s deposition notice, all within a thread that includes standard confidentiality safeguards and extensive contact details for the involved attorneys and the client’s representation.",

It has a lot to do with the the eye dr. that you asked me the question about this this afternoon. When we were there, I have managed to be able to talk to him and he fortunately has letters from retina associates, which you have down as the doctors that are giving me the shots to change the damage done to my eyes as a result of the accident, and he has 6 letters dating 28th january, right after the accident took place and was looking at my eyesight before the accident and the AI s change after the accident and it was substantial and they have got all all the readings and things down and they and retina associates when they gave me the injections to start to cure the damage to the eyes sends what what do you call follow up letters to the dr. that recommended me As a patient to them to do the work and they have got 6 letters from the 28th until like 3 or 4 months later or even 5 months later, I do not know what it was and they said they would be willing to go ahead and give me copies of those letters that we could use if we had to or you if you had to like for the the the meeting on Tuesday, if somebody says something about that or thinks we are trying to scam them, they have got backup letters from the doctors and Mike's got them in a folder under my name and because Mike had me as a customer for years and so if You think that is something that is important? He is printing them for me tonight and he is going to leave him at his office. He has to be in Virginia tomorrow, he is going to leave him for me at his office, and if I need to get him, I just need to come by and they'll be ready. But they are actually from retina associates to him as a follow up for him giving me as a reference to them to do the work, like if somebody wants to get you as an attorney, same type of idea, but Mike has got no reason to really want those things other than information to follow up on a customer that he sends to them to take care of, which gives Mike a good name type of thing, so if you get this message, call me back and say a or nay, otherwise I am going to have them with me on Tuesday and that will just give you or me or whoever has to answer against a possible statement like that being made.

      "natural_language": "Case: Wayne-Weber-MVA-01-01-2022. Client: Wayne Weber. A missed call for Bryce Koon was logged on 2025-04-12 at 01:54:25.564000+00:00, tagged #missedcall.

There is no caller email on file, and a link to the Filevine contact is provided as [filevine-link].\n\nVoicemail Transcription:\n\"Hey, Bryce, Wayne Weber, sorry to buzz you so late, but if you get this and and you want to call me back, I would appreciate if you would do that. It has a lot to do with the the eye dr. that you asked me the question about this this afternoon. When we were there, I have managed to be able to talk to him and he fortunately has letters from retina associates, which you have down as the doctors that are giving me the shots to change the damage done to my eyes as a result of the accident, and he has 6 letters dating 28th january, right after the accident took place and was looking at my eyesight before the accident and the AI s change after the accident and it was substantial and they have got all all the readings and things down and they and retina associates when they gave me the injections to start to cure the damage to the eyes sends what what do you call follow up letters to the dr. that recommended me As a patient to them to do the work and they have got 6 letters from the 28th until like 3 or 4 months later or even 5 months later, I do not know what it was and they said they would be willing to go ahead and give me copies of those letters that we could use if we had to or you if you had to like for the the the meeting on Tuesday, if somebody says something about that or thinks we are trying to scam them, they have got backup letters from the doctors and Mike's got them in a folder under my name and because Mike had me as a customer for years and so if You think that is something that is important? He is printing them for me tonight and he is going to leave him at his office. He has to be in Virginia tomorrow, he is going to leave him for me at his office, and if I need to get him, I just need to come by and they'll be ready. But they are actually from retina associates to him as a follow up for him giving me as a reference to them to do the work, like if somebody wants to get you as an attorney, same type of idea, but Mike has got no reason to really want those things other than information to follow up on a customer that he sends to them to take care of, which gives Mike a good name type of thing, so if you get this message, call me back and say a or nay, otherwise I am going to have them with me on Tuesday and that will just give you or me or whoever has to answer against a possible statement like that being made. It just backs up the idea that we were I was telling the truth about that and I never got a letter about it, but Mike had got 6 letters about it in the fall and also a Dr. Castle that ended up coming in and take care of my 1 eye where they remove whatever it is a cataract And all that kind of stuff, they even got that and he is sending that letter also. So that just gives you a basic idea of how in depth retina associate is and Mike is Mike could be a person like a surgeon type in retina associates because he has the same type of equipment that they have, but it is just His type of knowledge to learn as much as they possibly can by being an eye dr. upset, I will let you go. I hope you are having a good night. And if you could call me back, tell me a or NA. Otherwise, I will have it on Tuesday when when we get together again. Thanks, Bud, see you.\" \n\nLink to Filevine Contact: [filevine-link]\n\nIn addition to the voicemail content, the note indicates that the six letters originate from Retina Associates and pertain to follow-up communications related to the injections used to address eye damage from the accident. The letters are described as dated from January 28 (the date referenced as “28th January”) and extending to roughly three to five months after the accident, with the sender noting that copies could be provided for use in a Tuesday meeting to counter any potential questions or allegations.\n\nThe message also references a Dr. Castle who treated one eye, performing a cataract-related procedure, and notes that a letter from that treatment is being forwarded as well. The caller explains that Mike, who has known the client for years, has these letters in a folder under the client’s name and plans to print and leave copies at Mike’s Virginia office for retrieval if needed. The caller suggests that Mike’s involvement is solely for documentation and credibility, likening it to a professional referral context similar to someone referring you as an attorney.\n\nThe caller asks for a callback with a simple “A” (yes) or “NA” (no) to indicate whether the recipient views the letters as important, and indicates that otherwise the letters will accompany the client to the Tuesday meeting. The caller signs off as Bud, closing with a wish for a good night and again requesting a call back or confirmation ahead of Tuesday.",

Where people people now are calling me up saying that they are not going to be supplying me with any of the medical gear to monitor, you know, things like the neuropathy and glucose and the transduction things in the arm and all that and that that stuff has to be paid for and I have not contacted the insurance company as of yet to see what my options are. And so I would like to talk to you a little bit more about do not they have a legal responsibility see that if they are going to break the relationship with a patient that they should give them a certain amount of time and a reason for being able to make that makes that participation happen. And I was just wondering if you have been in the injury industry, have you ever worked with any banks before as to, you know, breaking up a relationship for 1 reason or another and not given the patient time to find another way to be able to continue taking care of the the medical side of what the accident basically caused or had a responsibility to be able to review the situation as a result of the accident, and if you could just give me about 15, 20 min to see if you and I can get together and I can show you this letter and show you how how lack of feeling, I guess the Word is that would be making the split or given me an opportunity to understand why the split was taking place and do something to go ahead and make a change if it is my fault for some reason, or if it is a lack of personality that developed over the years the because of whatever, and so if you could call me back and let me know if I could see you as soon as possible because they are trying to set me up for a video call on Friday, the 20 the 21st, but in the meantime, with reference to a thing called my chart, which is a so called the inner connection of correspondence between the dr. and the patient. And they are coming up with a whole new concept and expecting me to go through and learn to set up the my phone and everything else to be able to handle this video type of thing. And I did not even know at the time that I could make the appointment because they just called me up and said they are going to have a video call and wanted me to participate in it and I did not even know if I was going to have the opportunity or not have an appointment or be in Louisville and it is turning out that I can not make the appointment. And so now I am going to be looked at as a bad guy. Again, for whatever reason that they have not told me what it was and I need some direction so that I do not get myself put into a into a hole that I can not get myself out of. And I think in my opinion, I think they have a legal obligation, you know, to be able to make our split happen. With a with the detail of what I need to do over that 30 days and they need to keep representing me like the letter says up to the 30th day before they tell people that that are split has taken place and that they are no longer representing me or whatever and I have to go ahead and start paying or The equipment and insurance. In some cases, I am not even going to cover some of the things that that might have to happen. I do not know if I need to call Medicare and talk to them about picking up the insurance, but these are the things I need to talk to you about. Maybe have you give me some thought Or a path to take to protect myself and and I need somebody like yourself if if they do not have if they do not have a legal responsibility to do anything better than a single page letter that is basically saying, Hi, hello ha you are, you know, goodbye at the end of 30 days basically. So if you could call me back and give me some idea as to, you know, what your background might be. I sure like to have you, you know, get involved with me not only with with the other guys insurance company but with this hospital. So it is making any sense. I am my head's a little bit scrambled now because as of this morning. That thing I was telling you about with reference to maybe have a new 1 to work with me. Well, it is going to start this morning. I have a phone call and I have to send some money to them to be able to get this thing started and they already have all the electronic stuff and everything set up. For me and they are going to want to work with me probably for 4 or 506 days to be able to get the automation and everything else looked into my computers and stuff and I do not need something like this on a medical side affecting my ability to make a living. And I am thinking that what they did is they that is what they are doing and they do not know that it is really none of their business, but the idea of only 30 days with reference, to taking care of me with reference to what what had something to do with the with the accident and it also was also dealing with things that they were working with. Me with reference to the medical side of my life and I just do not have anybody to talk to that can possibly handle this in a reasonable period of time so that they felt that they send me this 1 letter, then they sent me a text and I can show you the text and it is it is having me take stop my time, you know, for getting together with this business situation, which is going to be taken care of this afternoon when the exchange of funds is going to be taking place and then they are automatically going to go right on to the state setup side of the business that I was talking to you about and that is going to take a lot of my time to be able to sit down and do that. So I know this is a long, long message on your on your answering system, but I did not know what else to do and I apologize for possibly taking too much of your time and I hope I did not wake you up, but I really need to have you give me some of your experience information on how you were me, what would you do? And I am thinking that they they need to do something from a legal standpoint because what they are doing now could affect mentally maybe and then I may do something wrong or whatever or it is something that they did I may not have I not have felt that they should have been handling their professionalism accordingly and I offered my opinion about it and so they decided, well, maybe they may not want to deal with me anymore because I am a little bit too mouthy when I think that things are not right and I am trying to work with people to get them right, maybe I just said something to them that they do not want to deal with anymore, I do not know. But the point is is that I think that the separation from the medical industry to me with reference to things that have been going on, it is not being handled correctly so that is the reason I am giving you a call and see if you could po",
