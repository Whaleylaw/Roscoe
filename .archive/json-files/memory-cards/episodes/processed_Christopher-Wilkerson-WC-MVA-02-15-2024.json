      "natural_language": "The case file is Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024, involving client Christopher Wilkerson and a workers\u2019 compensation claim, identified as Claim 04943051. The communications shown below are between The Whaley Law Firm and Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance regarding scheduling and documentation for Mr. Wilkerson.\n\nOn March 14, 2024 at 10:51 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Megan Bates regarding Christopher Wilkerson. In that message, Sarena attached Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s executed PIP Application and stated that their understanding is they need to reschedule Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement, asking Megan what date and time would work best for her.\n\nThe exchange continued on March 18, 2024. At approximately 11:04 AM, Megan Bates, a Claim Adjuster II with Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance in the Campbellsville Regional Office, replied to Sarena. Bates inquired whether a time on Wednesday would work for all parties and provided her contact information: 110 Nancy Cox Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718; PO Box 20400, Louisville, KY 40250-9802; Office phone 270-465-9771; Cell 270-799-4077; Fax 270-691-5750; kyfb.com.\n\nEarlier that same morning, at around 11:19 AM, Sarena responded to Megan\u2019s inquiry, saying she would check in with Mr. Wilkerson to determine what time would work best for him. Sarena noted that, as a truck driver, they obviously do not want to schedule this while he is driving.\n\nFinally, at 11:28 AM on March 18, 2024, Sarena informed Megan that Mr. Wilkerson is available at 10:00 AM. In her signature, Sarena provided The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to please use the new email address. The email chain demonstrates the ongoing coordination for Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement and the related PIP documentation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher Wilkerson WC MVA matter (Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024). Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This note summarizes the email communications regarding Claim 04943051 for Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nOn March 14, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Megan Bates of Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance (Campbellsville Regional Office). In her message, she advised that the attached Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s executed PIP Application was included and stated that the recorded statement needed to be rescheduled, asking Ms. Bates to provide a date and time that would work. Sarena\u2019s signature block identified her role and contact information, including the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and her email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), with a note indicating a new email address.\n\nLater, on March 18, 2024, Megan Bates replied. She indicated that a time on Wednesday would work and provided her contact details for Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance: Claim Adjuster II at the Campbellsville Regional Office, 110 Nancy Cox Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718; mail to PO Box 20400, Louisville, KY 40250-9802; Office phone (270) 465-9771; Cell (270) 799-4077; Fax (270) 691-5750; kyfb.com with a member login. In the thread, Bates also reiterated the rescheduling objective for Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement.\n\nThere is a separate note in the thread from Sarena Tuttle, indicating that Mr. Wilkerson is a truck driver and that, given his driving schedule, they should avoid scheduling the recorded statement while he is on the road. In response to the scheduling inquiry, Bates wrote, \u201cWould a time on Wednesday work for you all?\u201d and provided further contact details in her prior message. The exchange shows a collaborative effort to arrange a suitable time for the recorded statement.\n\nA later entry on March 18 shows Sarena confirming that Mr. Wilkerson was available at 10:00 a.m., and she again stressed the need to coordinate with Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s schedule due to his trucking duties.\n\nFinally, on March 20, 2024, at 10:14:37 a.m. (EDT), Sarena Tuttle sent an additional message to Megan Bates. She expressed appreciation for the discussion earlier that day and attached the scene photographs referenced during Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address, phone numbers, and her contact details included. The message also included a note to acknowledge the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.",

Once you have a chance to review the information and have any questions let me know. Thank you.\u201d The message is signed \u201cDebbie Smtih\u201d (as provided in the record).\n\nOverall, the record shows that, as of March 20, 2024, there had been no compensability decision received from Debbie\u2019s office and no acknowledgement of the prior request regarding dash cam footage. The Whaley Law Firm attached the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire to the March 20 correspondence and reiterated the need for confirmation about dash cam or recording devices and for preserving and forwarding any relevant recordings if they exist. The new email address for Sarena Tuttle is noted in the signatures throughout the chain.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024 centers on client Christopher Wilkerson and his workers\u2019 compensation claim (Claim: 04943051). In late March 2024, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s personnel were coordinating with Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance and corresponding parties regarding information requests, medical records, and scheduling related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s case.\n\nOn March 28, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Shellie Cooper at Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance with copies to Megan Bates, Greg Whaley, and Bryce Koon. She acknowledged receipt of the insurance carrier\u2019s request for Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation information and for wage/salary verification along with his work status notes. She provided the Workers\u2019 Compensation Carrier\u2019s information and explained that wage/salary information had been requested from the WC Adjuster on March 5, 2024 and that a follow-up was sent on March 20, 2024; she had spoken with the adjuster that day and noted that the adjuster is requesting the information, and they are awaiting a response. She added that Mrs. Smith (the carrier) and their office are both awaiting medical records from Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s providers and would forward them as soon as they are received. A list of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s current treating providers was included: Boyle County EMS, 18556 S. Danville Bypass, Danville, KY 40422 (fax 270-744-8642); Ephraim McDowell Regional Medical Center, 217 S. 3rd Street, Danville, KY 40422 (fax 859-239-6708); and Grant Chiropractic, 908 Russell Road, Columbia, KY 42728 (fax 270-384-2371). The email also carried Sarena\u2019s contact details and noted her new email address (E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com).\n\nThe thread also shows prior communications. On March 20, 2024 at 10:14 AM (approximately), Sarena informed Megan Bates that scene photographs discussed during Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement were attached, referencing the attached photographs. Her signature block followed, again confirming her role and new email address.\n\nEarlier, on March 18, 2024, Megan Bates replied with, \u201cThat works for me,\u201d regarding scheduling. Bates is a Claim Adjuster II with Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance, Campbellsville Regional Office, located at 110 Nancy Cox Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718 (mailing address: PO Box 20400, Louisville, KY 40250-9802). Her office phone is 270-465-9771, cell 270-799-4077, fax 270-691-5750. The company website is kyfb.com with a member login.\n\nIn the March 18, 2024, message from Sarena (11:29 AM), she stated that Mr. Wilkerson is available at 10:00 AM. Earlier that same day (11:19 AM), she noted that she would check with Mr. Wilkerson to determine a suitable time and acknowledged the need to avoid scheduling while he is driving, as he is a truck driver. A follow-up message from Sarena at 11:04 AM on March 18, 2024, confirmed Megan\u2019s question about a Wednesday time for the recording, including Megan\u2019s contact details as listed above.\n\nA prior March 14, 2024, 10:51 AM email from Sarena to Megan included Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s executed PIP (Personal Injury Protection) Application. Sarena indicated that they understood the recorded statement needed to be rescheduled and asked Megan to provide a date and time that would work best.\n\nThe thread thus documents the ongoing coordination among The Whaley Law Firm, Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance, and the involved parties to provide the requested information (including wage/salary verification and medical records), the listing of treating providers, the scheduling of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s recorded statement (with due consideration given to his truck-driving schedule), and the transmission of scene photographs from the recorded statement. The correspondence includes the carrier details, the adjuster\u2019s name and claim number (Hartford Mutual Insurance, formerly Clearpath; Adjuster: Debbie Smith; Claim: 238042), and the contact information for all involved parties, along with the notice of a new email address for Sarena Tuttle.",

The client described the timing as great and advised that PIP is up and ready to go, with us simply awaiting AWW/TTD information from the workers\u2019 compensation adjuster. He noted that the adjuster is dragging her feet a bit but is requesting AWW information and MRs as of today, and he expects to have an answer on lost wages hopefully by the end of next week. The client asked about compensation rates, and he was advised that it is too early to tell. We discussed how BI and WC settlements are figured and reaffirmed that, since we do not have any information on the Black Kia, there is no BI claim to pursue, so we will move forward with WC only. The client expressed understanding and appreciation for the information, and he said he would be going back to the chiropractor this Saturday.\n\nRegarding OWN, the client stated he does not remember being placed \u201coff work\u201d and that he was terminated immediately, so OWN was not necessary. He also advised that the employer forced him to sign a resignation document before he could pick up his last paycheck. He has filed for unemployment but expects denial due to the resignation document, and he is prepared to file an appeal and to advise UI about the forced signature. The client was very pleasant and will keep us updated on Tx Progress.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This matter concerns Christopher Wilkerson, with the file referenced as Christopher Wilkerson 238042.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, Debbie Smith, Senior Claims Examiner for Harford Mutual Insurance Group, sent a message to Sarena Tuttle confirming that ClearPath has accepted the claim as compensable. Debbie noted, however, that she had no medical records to verify any off-work status and that she had requested medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical. She indicated that she still needed a copy of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician. Debbie asked that any medical records be forwarded for her review and added that she had confirmed with the employer that they do not have a copy of dash cam footage of the accident. The message included a note about a merger: due to the completed merger with Harford Mutual Insurance Group, all @clearpathmutual.com addresses have changed to the @hm1842.com extension, and urged updating contact lists for efficient handling of correspondence. Debbie signed as Sr. Claims Examiner and provided her contact information, and the message carried the usual confidentiality and misaddress disclaimers typical of such communications.\n\nIn the prior correspondence, on March 6, 2024, Debbie Smith acknowledged Mr. Whaley\u2019s representation of Mr. Wilkerson, stating that once the reviewing of the information is completed and any questions arise, she would be in touch. The next day, March 7, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, noting that they had not yet received a compensability decision from Debbie\u2019s office, nor had they received acknowledgment of the firm\u2019s prior request to confirm whether the incident involved any dash cam footage. Sarena informed Debbie that the Employee's Statement Questionnaire had been attached as requested and invited further discussion if more information was needed. She included her contact details and reminded that her email address was the newly updated one.\n\nEarlier, on March 7, 2024, Sarena\u2019s message also conveyed that, at that time, the driver of the \u201cBlack KIA\u201d had not been identified, and requested the insured to advise whether the vehicle driven by Mr. Wilkerson was equipped with a dash cam or any recording device. If such a device existed, they asked that recordings\u2014whether video, audio, written, verbal, or otherwise\u2014be preserved and forwarded to their office for review and to aid in the investigation of the driver of the Black KIA.\n\nThen, on March 6, 2024, Debbie Smith had written to acknowledge Mr. Whaley\u2019s representation, indicating that upon review of the information and any questions arising, she would reach out. The March 20, 2024 communication from Sarena reiterates that no compensability decision had yet been provided and notes again the need for confirmation regarding dash cam footage; it also confirms that the Employee's Statement Questionnaire was sent as requested and reiterates that the firm is available to discuss the matter further.\n\nAdditionally, the thread contains standard email footers reflecting a recent merger and the associated changes of domain, and includes confidentiality notices typical of such communications. It also contains a cautionary note within one message about an external email and an automatic notice indicating the email\u2019s origin outside the organization.\n\nIn summary, after an initial representation acknowledgment, the parties discussed dash cam footage and the identity of the vehicle driver, with the Whaley firm supplying the Employee's Statement Questionnaire. By early April 2024, ClearPath/ClearPath-mutual records indicated the claim was accepted as compensable, but medical records to establish off-work status were still outstanding, with Debbie Smith requesting medical records from specified providers and copies of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician, while also confirming the absence of dash cam footage in the employer\u2019s records.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. In early April 2024, communications between The Whaley Law Firm and ClearPath/Harford Mutual Insurance Group concerned the workers\u2019 compensation claim for Christopher Wilkerson, arising from the motor vehicle incident on February 15, 2024. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, advised Debbie Smith that the executed Form 106 and Form 113 were attached and noted that Chris Wilkerson is still treating with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, Kentucky. The firm also stated that they had requested all medical records to date and were awaiting receipt, and that those records would be forwarded to Debbie as soon as they began arriving.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, Debbie Smith replied to acknowledge that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable. She stated, however, that she had no medical records to verify any off-work status and that she had requested medical information from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical. Debbie indicated she still needed a copy of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician. She asked that any available medical records be forwarded for her review and noted that the employer had confirmed they do not possess a copy of dash cam footage of the accident. Debbie also reminded recipients of the merger between Harford Mutual Insurance Group and ClearPath Mutual Insurance Group, after which all @clearpathmutual.com email addresses had changed to the @hm1842.com extension, and she requested recipients update their contact lists accordingly. Her contact details were provided: Sr. Claims Examiner, Harford Mutual Insurance Group, Phone: 502-315-4280; Main: 800-638-3669.\n\nThe communications prior to April 5, 2024 tracked a different point in the ongoing exchange. On March 20, 2024, Sarena Tuttle informed Debbie Smith that they had not yet received a compensability decision from Debbie\u2019s office, nor an acknowledgement of their earlier request for confirmation from Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s client regarding whether dash cam footage existed. She attached the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire and invited Debbie to request anything else needed to discuss the matter further. Sarena\u2019s message included her contact information and noted the new email address associated with The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nEarlier still, on March 7, 2024, Sarena wrote to Debbie: good morning, and thanks for the acknowledgement. She stated that once the requested questionnaire was returned, they would forward all documents to Debbie. At that time, the driver of the \u201cBlack KIA\u201d had not been identified. Sarena requested that Debbie\u2019s insured advise whether the vehicle Mr. Wilkerson was driving was equipped with a dash cam or any recording device, and that any such recordings be preserved and forwarded to the Whaley Law Firm for review and investigation into the identity of the driver of the Black KIA.\n\n Debbie Smith had previously acknowledged representation on March 6, 2024, stating that she had received the acknowledgement letter of Mr. Whaley\u2019s representation of Mr. Wilkerson, and inviting any questions once the information had been reviewed.\n\nThe communications reflect the ongoing efforts to assemble and review records, confirm compensability, determine the existence and preservation of dash cam footage, and confirm the designated physician. The correspondence also includes multiple confirmations of representation, notices about email domain changes following the merger, and standard confidentiality and error-handling notices embedded in the emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024\nClient: Christopher Wilkerson\n\nIn early 2024, the Christopher Wilkerson case (WC MVA, file 238042) unfolded as a communications exchange between The Whaley Law Firm and Harford Mutual Insurance Group (formerly ClearPath Mutual). The sequence begins with Debbie Smith, a Senior Claims Examiner for Harford Mutual, acknowledging the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s representation of Mr. Wilkerson. In an email dated March 6, 2024, she stated, \u201cPlease find my acknowledgement letter of Mr. Whaley\u2019s representation of Mr. Wilkerson,\u201d and noted the merger with Harford Mutual that had changed all @clearpathmutual.com addresses to @hm1842.com, advising the recipient to update their contact list. Debbie signed with her contact information and included confidentiality language typical of the communications.\n\nThe following day, March 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Debbie\u2019s acknowledgement. She expressed appreciation for the acknowledgement and indicated that once the Whaley firm received the requested questionnaire, they would forward all documents to Harford Mutual. She also noted that the driver of the Black KIA involved in the incident had not yet been identified and asked Debbie\u2019s insured to confirm whether the vehicle operated by Mr. Wilkerson was equipped with a dash cam or any recording device. If such a device existed, the Whaley firm requested preservation of all recordings and that copies be forwarded to their office for review and to aid in identifying the driver of the Black KIA. The message included Sarena\u2019s contact details and reminded recipients of the new email address.\n\nOn March 20, 2024, the thread continued with another communication from The Whaley Law Firm. Sarena Tuttle wrote that, to date, they had not received a compensability decision from Harford Mutual nor an acknowledgment of their earlier request regarding dash cam footage. She attached the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire as requested and invited Debbie to contact them if anything else was needed. The email reiterated the ongoing contact information for Sarena and again included the new email address.\n\nFurther correspondence followed on March 7 and March 20 that focused on the status of the investigation and the documentation needed. By March 20, the Whaley firm had provided the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire, and they reminded Harford Mutual to communicate any additional requirements so that the matter could proceed.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, the timeline shows two significant contributions from Debbie Smith and The Whaley Law Firm. At 9:29 AM, Debbie wrote to Sarena confirming that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable. She noted that she did not yet have medical records to verify any off-work status and that she had requested medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical. Debbie also requested a copy of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician and asked that any available medical records be forwarded for her review. She added that she had confirmed with the employer that they did not possess any dash cam footage of the accident. Debbie closed with thanks.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 9:46 AM, Sarena responded with a message confirming that the claim remained compensable. She attached the executed Form 106 and Form 113 and provided details about Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s current treatment: he was still seeing Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, Kentucky. She stated that all available medical records had been requested and were being sought, and she would forward them to Debbie as they were received. Sarena noted that the firm had already requested all medical records to date and would forward them when obtained. She also reaffirmed the new Harford Mutual contact information and included the standard confidentiality and external-origin notices found in the correspondence.\n\nThroughout the April 5 exchanges, the notices regarding the merger remained prominent, reminding recipients that all @clearpathmutual.com addresses had been migrated to the @hm1842.com extension, and encouraging updating of contact lists for efficient handling. The emails also contained the customary confidential-use notices and warnings about handling confidential information and about false or fraudulent claims.\n\nKey facts preserved from the correspondence:\n- Case: Christopher Wilkerson, WC MVA case, file reference Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024; Client: Christopher Wilkerson; Claim number or internal reference 238042.\n- Parties involved: The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager) and Harford Mutual Insurance Group (formerly ClearPath Mutual) via Debbie Smith (Senior Claims Examiner) and other Harford Mutual communications staff.\n- Timeline of material communications: \n  - March 6, 2024: Debbie Smith acknowledges Whaley\u2019s representation (merger-related email domain change noted).\n  - March 7, 2024: Sarena Tuttle requests the dash cam/recording-device information and preservation of any recordings; driver of Black KIA not identified.\n  - March 20, 2024: Sarena notes no compensability decision received and attaches Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire; reiterates request regarding dash cam footage.\n  - March 20, 2024: (Earlier in the thread) The Whaley firm sent the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire; continued to pursue information.\n  - April 5, 2024: Debbie confirms that ClearPath has accepted the claim as compensable; medical-records status pending; requests medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical; requests medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician; confirms no dash cam footage is in the employer\u2019s possession.\n  - April 5, 2024: Sarena confirms compensable status and forwards Form 106 and Form 113 as executed; notes ongoing treatment with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center; states that medical records have been requested and will be forwarded as they are received.\n- Medical treatment and records: At the time of the April 5 communications, Chris Wilkerson was actively treated by Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, KY. The requesting party sought medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, along with a medical authorization and Form 113 to identify the designated physician.\n- Dash cam/records: Attempts were made to locate dash cam footage from the incident; the employer stated they did not have a copy of any dash cam footage.\n- Documentation shared: Form 106 and Form 113 (executed) were attached in the April 5, 2024 reply from The Whaley Law Firm; an Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire had been provided earlier by the Whaley Firm; copies of these documents were exchanged as part of the case administration.\n- Contact and confidentiality notes: The emails reference the merger\u2013driven domain change to @hm1842.com; there are standard confidentiality notices and cautions about external emails and the illegality of false claims.\n\nIn sum, by early April 2024 the claim was accepted as compensable, Mr. Wilkerson remained under treatment with Grant Chiropractic Center, and the parties were actively pursuing medical records, medical authorization, and confirmation of the designated physician, with Form 106 and Form 113 executed and exchanged. The communications also reflect the ongoing efforts to obtain dash cam footage and to identify the driver of the other vehicle, the Black KIA, involved in the incident.",

He also stated that Nathan Bennett is not properly registered with Safety Clearinghouse and does not drug test their employees prior to putting them behind the wheel. I advised that I would update AW/BK on this for consideration of a wrongful termination (WFT) suit, and I explained that Kentucky is an at-will state, which allows employers to terminate with little or no reason, making WFT claims difficult.

The client states he is still experiencing pain in his hip and ribs nearly 90 days post-accident. We discussed the possibility of a tear or a pinched nerve in the hip and advised the client to discuss this with Dr. Grant further and to see if additional imaging should be requested. The client expressed understanding and will discuss at his next appointment on May 11.\n\nAdditionally, we discussed how workers\u2019 compensation claims are valued and that it is impossible to begin discussing dollar amounts due to impairment weight in the formula.

In that message, Debbie stated that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable, but there were no medical records to verify any off-work status; she had requested medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, and she still needed a copy of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician. Debbie asked that any medical records be forwarded for her review.\n\nThat same day, April 5, 2024, at 9:46 a.m., Sarena Tuttle replied with the executed Form 106 and Form 113 attached and noted that Mr. Wilkerson was still treating with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, Kentucky. The Whaley Law Firm had requested all medical records to date and was awaiting receipt; once records were received, they would be forwarded to Debbie Smith. The message included Sarena Tuttle\u2019s contact information and repeated the new email address notice.\n\nEarlier in the process, on April 5, 2024 at 9:29 a.m., Debbie Smith confirmed that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable but again emphasized that there were no medical records to verify off-work status and reiterated the need for medical records from specific providers and for a medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician. She also confirmed that she had requested medical records for review and noted that the employer did not have dash cam footage of the accident.\n\nOn March 20, 2024, Sarena Tuttle sent Debbie Smith a message noting that, to date, the Whaley Law Firm had not received a compensability decision from Debbie\u2019s office, nor an acknowledgement of their prior email requesting confirmation about dash cam footage for the incident. The message stated that the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire was attached and ready for return, and that if Debbie needed anything else, she should contact them directly to discuss the matter.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Debbie Smith in good morning form, thanking her for the acknowledgment and indicating that once the requested questionnaire was returned, all documents would be forwarded. At that time, the driver of the \u201cBlack KIA\u201d had not been identified. The Whaley Law Firm requested that Debbie\u2019s insured inform whether the vehicle Mr. Wilkerson was driving was equipped with any dash cam or recording device, and if so, that any recordings\u2014video, audio, written, verbal, or otherwise\u2014be preserved and forwarded as relevant.\n\nThe communications reflect a continuing process to confirm compensability, gather medical records and designations, and manage Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s ongoing medical treatment as part of the workers\u2019 compensation matter arising from the MVA on February 15, 2024, with the case caption and client details noted at the top. The thread also documents the administrative transition caused by Harford Mutual\u2019s merger, including the new hm1842.com email addresses and the accompanying confidentiality and disclosure notices embedded in the messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nThis narrative covers the communications regarding Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim (Claim No. 238042) as handled by The Whaley Law Firm and the claims administrator, Harford Mutual Insurance Group (domain hm1842.com), from March 2024 through August 2024. The Whaley Law Firm represented Mr. Wilkerson in the matter, with Sarena M. Tuttle serving as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager. The firm\u2019s contact details were: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address change to the new domain).\n\nOn March 20, 2024, Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Debbie Smith indicating that, to date, they had not received a compensability decision from Harford Mutual nor an acknowledgement of their prior email requesting confirmation from Mr. Wilkerson about whether there was dash cam footage of the incident. She attached the Employee\u2019s Statement Questionnaire and invited Debbie to contact them directly if anything else was needed.\n\nIn early April 2024, the communications continued as follows: Debbie Smith responded on April 5, 2024, confirming that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable, but noting that there were no medical records to verify any off-work status. Debbie stated that medical records were being requested from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, and that a copy of the medical authorization and KY DWC Form 113 was needed to confirm the designated physician. She asked that any medical records be forwarded for review and noted that the employer did not have dash cam footage of the accident. In the same thread, Debbie\u2019s message included a reminder about the merger that had changed all @clearpathmutual.com addresses to the @hm1842.com extension and urged updating contact lists accordingly. Earlier in the day, Sarena had informed Debbie that Form 106 and Form 113 had been executed, and that Chris was still receiving treatment with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, KY. They were awaiting receipt of medical records to date and planned to forward them as soon as they were received.\n\nThroughout April 2024, the exchange continued with regard to medical records and treating providers. Debe\u2019s notes reiterate the need for medical records and the Form 113 to confirm the designated physician; the team also confirmed that they were seeking medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, and they requested any available records be forwarded for review. There is also mention of continued discussion about whether dash cam footage existed, with the employer specifically stating they did not have any dash cam footage of the accident.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, Sarena Tuttle provided an updated status. She advised Debbie that Mr. Wilkerson was unhappy with the treatment at Grant Chiropractic and that Dr. Grant had told him that after exhausting his initial 20 visits, his claim had ended. Mr. Wilkerson had scheduled an appointment with Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation on Greenbriar Drive in Campbellsville, KY for July 29, 2024. The message noted the attachment of an updated KY DWC Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation and invited any questions or further discussion.\n\nFinally, on August 12, 2024, Sarena Tuttle sent another update. She reported that Mr. Wilkerson had called that morning to say he had been terminated from his job due to his medical treatment and ongoing appointments. The Whaley Law Firm requested the initiation of his temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and asked Debbie Smith to contact them if there were any questions or issues with the request.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a series of communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Harford Mutual (HM) regarding Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, covering March through August 2024. Key elements include ongoing medical treatment with Grant Chiropractic (and later Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation), a claim acceptance as compensable, the need for medical records and Form 113 to designate the physician, dash cam footage status, and finally the request to commence TTD benefits after Mr. Wilkerson reported termination from employment due to medical treatment. Attachments mentioned in the exchanges include the executed Form 106 and Form 113 (as of April 5, 2024) and an updated KY DWC Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiropractic (as of July 24, 2024).",

      "natural_language": "The case Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024 involves client Christopher Wilkerson. The communications center on April 2024, when Debbie Smith, Sr. Claims Examiner for ClearPath Specialty Insurance (later referred to after the merger as Harford Mutual Insurance Group, with email addresses transitioning to the hm1842.com domain), advised The Whaley Law Firm that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable but that there were no medical records yet to verify any off-work status. Debbie noted that she had requested medical records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, and she needed a copy of the medical authorization and the KY Department of Workers\u2019 Claims Form 113 to confirm the designated physician. She also asked that any medical records be forwarded for review and added that the employer did not have a copy of dash cam footage of the accident. She supplied her direct and main contact numbers and included confidential\u2011communication notices customary for the insurer.\n\nShortly after, on the same thread, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, responded on April 5, 2024. She advised that she was attaching the executed Form 106 and Form 113, and she stated that Mr. Wilkerson was still currently treating with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, Kentucky. She noted that they had requested all medical records to date and were awaiting receipt of those records, and that once they began receiving them, they would forward them to Debbie for review.\n\nAlso on April 5, 2024, Debbie\u2019s message confirmed that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable but reiterated the lack of medical records to verify off-work status and the need for medical authorizations and Form 113. She indicated she had requested records from Ephraim McDowell, Grant Chiropractic, and Adair Family Medical, and she again asked for a copy of the medical authorization and Form 113 to confirm the designated physician, adding that if any medical records were available, they should be forwarded. Debbie also confirmed with The Whaley Law Firm that the employer did not possess dash cam footage of the accident. In the same thread, Debbie reminded that, due to the merger with Harford Mutual Insurance Group, all ClearPath email addresses had transitioned to the hm1842.com extension.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on April 5, 2024 (with timestamps in the exchanged emails), Sarena had also sent a separate note to Debbie noting that Chris was still treating with Dr. Grant and that Form 106 and Form 113 had been attached. She stated that they had requested all medical records to date and would forward them as soon as they were received.\n\nBy July 24, 2024, the communications indicate a shift in Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s treatment experience. In an email from Sarena, she reported that Mr. Wilkerson was not happy with the treatment at Grant Chiropractic, and Dr. Grant advised that since Mr. Wilkerson had exhausted his initial 20 visits, the claim had ended. Mr. Wilkerson had made an appointment with Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation on Greenbriar Drive in Campbellsville, Kentucky for July 29, 2024. The email also notes that the updated Kentucky DWC Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation was attached, and Sarena invited Debbie to contact them directly if there were questions for further discussion.\n\nOn August 12, 2024 at 1:38 PM, Sarena notified Debbie that Mr. Wilkerson had been terminated from his job due to his medical treatment and ongoing appointments, and she requested initiation of his Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits, asking The Whaley Law Firm to contact their office if there were any questions or issues regarding the request.\n\nBy August 23, 2024, the thread shows ongoing concerns about therapy approval. At 2:23 PM, Sarena wrote that Mr. Wilkerson had contacted them again, advising that his physical therapy had not yet been approved. She asked Debbie to update them on what was required to obtain approval for his physical therapy and indicated that they were awaiting medical records for his TTD benefits.\n\nThat same day, at 9:16 PM, Debbie replied to Sarena. She stated that she had faxed approval for 12 therapy visits and requested updated notes for off-work status so she could review the file for lost time. Debbie closed with thanks and included the standard confidentiality and privacy disclaimers associated with her communications.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondence also carried standard headers and notices. The messages emphasized confidentiality and the restricted distribution of attachments, reminded recipients that the communications were intended solely for the named addressees, and advised that the merger had caused the @clearpathmutual.com addresses to become @hm1842.com addresses. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and Dr. Grant\u2019s and Taylor Co. Chiropractic\u2019s involvement were repeatedly referenced, along with status updates on medical records, Form 106, Form 113, and the designation of the physician, as well as the ongoing issue of off-work status and lost-time review.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher Wilkerson, WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This matter concerns a workers\u2019 compensation claim (Christopher Wilkerson, 238042) arising from a motor vehicle accident on February 15, 2024. The Whaley Law Firm represents Mr. Wilkerson, with Sarena M. Tuttle serving as the litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager. The correspondence in this file involves Debbie Smith, a Senior Claims Examiner for ClearPath Specialty Insurance, later operating under Harford Mutual Insurance Group after a merger, and members of the Whaley team including Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon. The case file contains multiple communications spanning April through August 2024.\n\nOn April 5, 2024, Debbie Smith advised that ClearPath had accepted the claim as compensable, but there were no medical records to verify any off-work status, and she indicated that those records had been requested. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle responded with attachments: the executed Form 106 and Form 113. She noted that Mr. Wilkerson was still receiving treatment with Dr. Anthony Grant at Grant Chiropractic Center in Columbia, Kentucky, and that all medical records to date had been requested and were awaited; as soon as records began arriving, they would be forwarded.\n\nThe thread continued with additional updates over the ensuing months. On July 24, 2024, Sarena reported that Mr. Wilkerson was not happy with the treatment at Grant Chiropractic, and that Dr. Grant had advised that since Mr. Wilkerson had exhausted his initial 20 visit allowance, his claim had ended. Mr. Wilkerson subsequently scheduled an appointment with Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation on Greenbriar Drive in Campbellsville, Kentucky for July 29, 2024. An updated KY Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiropractic was attached.\n\nBy August 12, 2024, Sarena informed Debbie that Mr. Wilkerson had called to report he had been terminated from his position due to his medical treatment and ongoing appointments, and that initiation of his Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits was requested.\n\nOn August 23, 2024, Debbie indicated that she had faxed approval for 12 therapy visits and requested updated notes on the off-work status so she could review the file for lost time. Later that day, at 2:23 PM, Sarena responded that Mr. Wilkerson had again contacted them, stating that his physical therapy had not yet been approved and asking what was needed to obtain PT approval; she also noted that they were awaiting medical records for TTD benefits.\n\nThat same day, Debbie reiterated the status of the PT approval by stating that 12 therapy visits had been approved by the insurer. The thread included standard reminders about confidentiality and the external origin of some emails, and also contained the insurer\u2019s new contact information following the merger with Harford Mutual Insurance Group: Debbie\u2019s message reminded that, due to the merger, all ClearPath email addresses had changed to the hm1842.com domain. In the Whaley firm signature blocks, Sarena noted the new email address and included her contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nOn August 26, 2024, Sarena sent a brief closing note: \u201cGood morning Debbie, That is awesome. Thank you so much.\u201d Her message was followed by the standard firm signature block, including a reminder of her new email address.\n\nThroughout these communications, the case remained identified as Christopher Wilkerson, 238042, with the overarching matter being a workers\u2019 compensation claim associated with a motor vehicle incident dated February 15, 2024. The communications document ongoing efforts to obtain therapeutic approvals (initial therapy visits and later therapy approval), medical records to support off-work status and TTD benefits, changes in treating providers (Grant Chiropractic to Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation), and the associated administrative actions required by both the insurer and the law firm to move the claim forward.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This narrative covers the communications surrounding Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation matter (Christopher Wilkerson 238042) from spring through late summer 2024, including treatment updates, employment status, and requests for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits.\n\nIn the sequence of communications, Debbie Smith at ClearPath Specialty Insurance (now operating under Harford Mutual Insurance Group, with the newer hm1842.com domain) received an update from The Whaley Law Firm on April 5, 2024 noting the domain change and instructing others to update contact lists accordingly. Debbie\u2019s message explained that all ClearPath emails had transitioned to the hm1842.com extension due to the merger with Harford Mutual; recipients were asked to update their contact lists to ensure efficient handling of email correspondence.\n\nOn July 24, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm informed Debbie that Mr. Wilkerson was not satisfied with treatment at Grant Chiropractic. Dr. Grant advised that because Mr. Wilkerson had exhausted his initial 20 visits, the claim had ended. Mr. Wilkerson had scheduled an appointment with Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation on Greenbriar Drive in Campbellsville, KY for July 29, 2024. Sarena noted that the updated Kentucky Department of Workers\u2019 Claims Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiro was attached to that communication.\n\nBy August 12, 2024, Sarena Tuttle reported that Mr. Wilkerson had called earlier that morning to say he had been terminated from his position due to his medical treatment and ongoing appointments. At that time, she reiterated the request for initiation of TTD Benefits and asked Debbie to contact their office if there were questions or issues with the request.\n\nOn August 23, 2024 at 2:23 PM, Sarena again wrote to Debbie (with Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon cc\u2019d) that Mr. Wilkerson had contacted them again, this time indicating that his Physical Therapy had not yet been approved. She requested an update on what was needed to obtain PT approval and noted that they were awaiting medical records for his TTD benefits.\n\nThat same day, August 23, 2024, Debbie Smith replied at 5:16 PM, stating that she had faxed approval for 12 therapy visits. Debbie asked that The Whaley Law Firm provide updated notes for Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s off-work status so she could review the file for lost time. Debbie\u2019s signature identified her as Senior Claims Examiner for ClearPath Specialty Insurance, with Direct and Main phone numbers listed, and she included the standard confidentiality and external-email notices that accompany such communications. The message also contained the customary reminder to reference the claim number when faxing claim documents and to be aware of the newly updated hm1842.com email addresses.\n\nLater on August 26, 2024 at 9:34 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Debbie with a brief, courteous note: \u201cThat is awesome. Thank you so much.\u201d This acknowledged the earlier step of PT approval and related documentation.\n\nThe latest substantive update came on August 27, 2024. In that message, Sarena Tuttle advised Debbie that Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s last day of work had been August 2, 2024. She attached certified medical records from Taylor Co. Chiro & Rehab, which stated that Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s seated occupation was contributing to limited and delayed progress/response to care. The communication noted that Mr. Wilkerson had been terminated from employment due to missing too many days for treatment, and he was requesting TTD benefits to support his treatment and recovery until he could return to full-time work. Sarena requested an update on the initiation of his TTD benefits and invited Debbie to contact her directly to discuss any further needs.\n\nContact details for ongoing communications remained with Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line was (502) 357-9971, and her office line was (502) 583-4022 ext 104, with the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address). Debbie Smith\u2019s role as Sr. Claims Examiner for ClearPath Specialty Insurance (now hm1842 domain) continued with Direct: 502-315-4280 and Main: 800-638-3669, and included similar confidentiality notices in correspondence.\n\nIn summary, the case details reflect Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s termination from employment on August 2, 2024 due to attendance issues related to his medical treatment, the attachment of Taylor Co. chiropractic records indicating a seated occupation contributing to slow progress, and a request for TTD benefits to support treatment and recovery until he can return to full-time work. There were approvals for 12 therapy visits, requests for updated off-work notes to support lost-time review, and ongoing dialogue between The Whaley Law Firm and ClearPath/Harford Mutual representatives to address PT approval and TTD initiation.",

      "natural_language": "The following is a narrative summary of the communications about Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim (238042) arising from the motor vehicle incident dated February 15, 2024 (WC-MVA-02-15-2024). The client is Christopher Wilkerson, with The Whaley Law Firm handling the case and Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, coordinating the communications with Debbie Smith of ClearPath Specialty Insurance (later noted to be under Harford Mutual Insurance Group).\n\nOn August 12, 2024, Sarena Tuttle advised Debbie Smith that she had spoken with Mr. Wilkerson earlier that morning and learned he had been terminated from his position due to medical treatment and ongoing appointments. She reiterated the request to initiate Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits and asked Debbie to contact The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office if there were any questions or issues with the request.\n\nOn August 23, 2024, at 2:23 PM, Sarena wrote again to Debbie, reporting that Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s PT had not yet been approved and asking what was needed to obtain PT approval. She also stated that the team was awaiting medical records for his TTD benefits.\n\nLater on August 23, 2024, at 5:16 PM, Debbie Smith replied that she had faxed approval for 12 therapy visits and requested updated notes for the off-work status so she could review the file for lost time.\n\nOn August 26, 2024, at 9:34 AM, Sarena responded, \u201cGood morning Debbie, That is awesome. Thank you so much.\u201d indicating appreciation for Debbie\u2019s earlier action.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, at 1:29 PM, Sarena provided a more substantive update: Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s last day working was August 2, 2024. She attached certified medical records from Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehab, which indicate that the seated occupation is causing limited or delayed progress/response to care. She noted that Mr. Wilkerson had been terminated from employment due to missing too many days for treatment, and, at this time, would like to receive TTD benefits to aid his treatment and recovery until he is able to return to full-time work. She requested an update on the initiation of his TTD benefits and asked Debbie to let them know if anything else was needed.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, at 1:56 PM (13:56:46 in the timestamp), Sarena stated that she and Mr. Wilkerson had recently spoken with his treating physician. They were updated that Mr. Wilkerson had been given the opportunity to see how his injuries would fare under normal working conditions, but his condition had not improved and he had returned to treatment. The Whaley Law Firm and the provider would continue to pursue treatment intended to reduce his pain while working and to achieve maximum medical improvement.

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nIn October 2024, the Whaley Law Firm sent a forward of communications regarding Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation matter, titled \u201cFwd: Christopher Wilkerson 238042.\u201d The message, dated October 8, 2024, was from Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, to Mrs. Woods, with CCs to Bryce Koon and others. It requested treatment updates and \u201cany and all documents related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages,\u201d noting that Mrs. Smith would be out of the office for the remainder of the week but that the documents were needed as soon as possible. The email signature identified Sarena M. Tuttle and included her contact information and a notification to note the new email address.\n\nThe forwarded thread contains a subsequent message from Sarena Tuttle, dated October 8, 2024 at 1:56 PM, addressed to Debbie Smith with CCs to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon. In this message, they reported having spoken with Mr. Wilkerson and his treating physician. They updated that Mr. Wilkerson had been given the opportunity to see how his injuries would respond under normal working conditions, but his condition has not improved and he has returned to treatment. The team stated they were working with his provider to ensure he receives the necessary treatment to reduce pain while working and to move toward a maximum medical improvement (MMI) standpoint. They also requested a copy of any and all documents used to calculate his average weekly wages for the incident.\n\nThis October thread followed earlier communications from August 2024. On August 27, 2024 at 1:29 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Debbie Smith (with CCs to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon) that Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s last day of work was August 2, 2024. She attached certified medical records from Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation, which indicated that Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s seated occupation was causing limited or delayed progress/response to care. The message stated that Mr. Wilkerson had been terminated from employment due to missing too many days for treatment and that, at this time, he would like to receive temporary total disability (TTD) benefits to assist with treatment and recovery until he could return to full-time work. They asked Debbie Smith to update them on whether TTD initiation had begun and to contact them if anything else was needed to discuss the matter.\n\nThe August 27 message was preceded by an August 26, 2024 note in which Sarena Tuttle replied, \u201cGood morning Debbie, That is awesome. Thank you so much,\u201d expressing thanks.\n\nEarlier, on August 23, 2024 at 5:16 PM, Debbie Smith replied that she had faxed approval for 12 therapy visits and requested updated notes for the off-work status so she could review the file for lost time. The reply included standard confidentiality and contact disclaimers and references to claiming documents going by fax to 410-420-3002 with the instruction to reference the claim number. Debbie Smith identified her role as Sr. Claims Examiner at Clearpath Specialty Insurance, with direct and main contact numbers provided.\n\nAlso on August 23, 2024 at 2:23 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent another message (labeled as external in the chain) to Debbie Smith, noting that Mr. Wilkerson had reached out again, indicating that his physical therapy had not yet been approved. They requested clarification on what was needed to get his PT approved and stated they were awaiting medical records for his TTD benefits at that time.\n\nThe chronology also includes an August 12, 2024 message from Sarena Tuttle at 1:38 PM to Debbie Smith. In this message, they reported receiving a call from Mr. Wilkerson stating that he had been terminated from his position due to his medical treatment and continued appointments. They again requested initiation of his TTD benefits and invited further discussion if there were questions or issues.\n\nAdditionally, on July 24, 2024, at 12:06 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Debbie Smith (and CC\u2019d Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon) reporting that Mr. Wilkerson was unhappy with the treatment at Grant Chiropractic. Dr. Grant had advised that because Mr. Wilkerson had exhausted his initial 20 visits, the claim had ended. Mr. Wilkerson had scheduled an appointment with Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation on Greenbriar Drive in Campbellsville, KY for July 29, 2024. The email included attachment of the updated Kentucky Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation Form 113 for Taylor Co. Chiro and invited any questions.\n\nIn summary, between July and October 2024, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s case involved: termination from employment on account of medical treatment and attendance, initiation and pursuit of TTD benefits, scheduling and switching between chiropractors (Grant Chiropractic to Taylor Co. Chiropractic & Rehabilitation), approval and scheduling of therapy visits (12 therapy visits approved), ongoing requests for documentation to calculate average weekly wages, updates on treatment status and progress toward maximum medical improvement, and repeated requests for medical records to support disability and wage calculations. The communications were exchanged primarily between The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena Tuttle, including contact details and the note about a new email address) and Debbie Smith at Clearpath Specialty Insurance, with CCs to Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon. The claim number referenced in the correspondence is 238042. The firm\u2019s address is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s direct and office lines, and Sarena\u2019s email address was noted as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.",

The message was addressed to Sarena Tuttle and Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm, with Debbie Smith (DSmith@hm1842.com) also on the To line; no one was listed in CC. The email was sent from Kristi Woods (notifications@hm1842.com). In her note, Kristi stated that, in review of Debbie\u2019s prior file notes on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim dated August 13, 2024, Debbie had approved PT X12 and mentioned she was waiting on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s medical records to review any mention of Temporary Total Disability (TTD) or medical status. Kristi added that once those medical records are received, they will have a better idea of how to move forward. The message includes a reminder: if faxing claim documents, please fax to 410-420-3002 and reference the claim number. Kristi\u2019s signature identifies her as a Claims Examiner for CLEARPATH SPECIALTY INSURANCE, with Direct line 502-315-4284 and Main line 800-638-3669.\n\nThis email also contains the confidentiality and security notices typical of the insurer\u2019s communications, including a general warning about the confidentiality of the message and attached files, and a disclaimer that any review or distribution by unintended recipients is prohibited.

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nRe: Christopher Wilkerson 238042. The following narrative summarizes the email communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Harford Mutual Insurance Group regarding Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, at 10:07 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Kristi Woods of Harford Mutual Insurance Group. In the message, which also included Bryce Koon on CC and Debbie Smith on CC, Sarena thanked Kristi for the quick response earlier that morning. She stated that, while she understood Harford\u2019s position on temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, The Whaley Law Firm was requesting the documents related to the calculations of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages (AWW). She clarified that they were not asking Harford to initiate TTD at that time; that would be addressed with Mrs. Smith separately. Regardless of the status of TTD, Sarena asserted that the law firm was entitled to a copy of the documents used to calculate the AWW benefits, noting that this request had been made since the initiation of the claim and the documents had not yet been received. The message closed with Sarena\u2019s professional signature, which included her title, the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, direct and office phone numbers, and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a parenthetical note stating \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nIn the same thread, Kristi Woods replied on October 10, 2024, at approximately 10:02 a.m. (the record shows \u201c10:02?AM,\u201d indicating an uncertain timestamp). Her response referenced Debbie\u2019s prior file notes on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim dated August 13, 2024. Kristi indicated that Debbie had approved physical therapy (PT X12) and that Debbie was waiting on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s medical records to review any mention of TTD or medical status. Kristi stated that once those medical records were received, Harford would have a clearer idea of how to proceed. Kristi\u2019s reply also included a note instructing the recipient to fax claim documents to 410-420-3002 and to reference the claim number. Her signature identified her as Claims Examiner for CLEARPATH SPECIALTY INSURANCE, with direct line 502-315-4284 and main line 800-638-3669, and a reminder of the company\u2019s social media presence.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Sarena had forwarded a message from herself to Kristi Woods on October 10, 2024, at 9:39 a.m. In that forwarded note, Sarena requested \u201cour treatment update & request for any and all documents related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages.\u201d She noted that Mrs. Smith would be out of the office for the remainder of that week but stressed the need to obtain the documents as soon as possible. Sarena also asked Kristi to inform Mrs. Smith that Kristi\u2019s auto-reply email address was incorrect. The forward included Sarena\u2019s full signature details and Kristi Woods\u2019 contact information again, along with a reminder that replies to the email would be saved in the records.\n\nThe messages also contained standard confidentiality and organizational notices typical of the correspondence, including Harford Mutual\u2019s confidentiality language and disclosures intended to restrict access to the information to the named recipients. The thread consistently referenced the case and claim number (Christopher Wilkerson 238042) and noted the ongoing needs surrounding Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s AWW calculations, medical records, and the status of potential TTD discussions.",

Kristi indicated that Debbie had approved PT X12 and mentioned she was waiting on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s medical records to review any mention of temporary total disability (TTD) or medical status. Kristi stated that once those medical records were received, ClearPath would have a clearer path forward for handling the claim.\n\nEarlier the same day, Sarena sent a forwarded message reiterating the request for treatment updates and the documents related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages, reiterating that the request was not to initiate TTD at that time but to obtain the documentation used to calculate potential benefits. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details were included, and the message again noted Mrs. Smith\u2019s anticipated absence.\n\nIn addition to these October 2024 exchanges, Debbie Smith, Sr. Claims Examiner at ClearPath Specialty Insurance, subsequently addressed the matter on November 9, 2024. In a message to Sarena Tuttle, Debbie confirmed that she would be sending a request to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s employer for a copy of his wages. Debbie explained that, because this was a medical-only claim, she had not previously requested wages. She stated that the wages appear on the First Report of Injury (FROI) as $10.00 per hour for 40 hours, totaling $400.00. Debbie planned to follow up with the employer for a response and asked to be notified if any additional information was needed. Debbie provided the contact details for her office (Direct: 502-315-4280; Main: 800-638-3669) and reminded recipients of the fax reference process for claim documents (to fax to 410-420-3002 and reference the claim number). The November 9, 2024 message also included Debbie\u2019s signature block and the confidentiality notice typical of these communications.\n\nThroughout these interactions, the communications referenced the confidential and restricted nature of the information, the need to limit distribution to the addressee(s) named, and the penalties for presenting fraudulent information. It is also noted in the communications that The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s staff included Sarena M. Tuttle (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext. 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; new email address indicated) and Kristi Woods (Claims Examiner at ClearPath Specialty Insurance; Direct: 502-315-4284; Main: 800-638-3669). ClearPath Specialty Insurance\u2019s notice sections reiterate that misrepresentation or fraudulent claims are crimes and that confidential communications must be treated accordingly.\n\nIn summary, the record shows that from October 10, 2024, through November 9, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm sought the documents used to calculate Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages and a treatment update, while ClearPath, represented by Debbie Smith, prepared to obtain wage information from the employer for a medical-only claim, with the wages documented on the FROI as $10.00/hour for 40 hours ($400.00). Debbie also noted that she would follow up with the employer and kept the other parties apprised of the steps being taken.\n\nEnd of note.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This narrative covers the communications in late 2024 and early 2025 related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim (case number 238042) and the request for documents used to calculate his Average Weekly Wages (AWW).\n\nOn October 10, 2024, a thread began with Sarena Tuttle forwarding a message regarding Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim to Kristi Woods (and cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon). In the forwarded message, Sarena noted that their treatment update and a request for any and all documents related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages were being supplied. She explained that they understood Mrs. Smith would be out of the office for the remainder of the week but emphasized the desire to obtain these documents as soon as possible. She also asked Kristi Woods to inform Mrs. Smith that her auto-reply email address was incorrect. The forwarding included Sarena\u2019s standard contact details and signature.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 9:39 AM, Sarena had sent the same forward to Kristi Woods with a public-facing disclaimer indicating the external origin of the email. The content of the forwarding stated that the Whaley Law Firm was providing the treatment update and reiterating the request for any and all documents related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wages and noted the willingness to proceed even though Mrs. Smith would be unavailable for the week. It also included Sarena\u2019s confidentiality notice and her contact information.\n\nKristi Woods replied to Sarena on October 10, 2024 at 10:02 AM. In her response, she indicated she had reviewed the prior file notes from Debbie regarding Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim, dated August 13, 2024. Kristi stated that Debbie had approved PT X12 and that she was waiting on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s medical records to review any mention of temporary total disability (TTD) or medical status. Kristi added that once the medical records were received, the team would have a clearer idea of how to move forward. The reply also contained the standard note advising recipients on faxing claim documents and included confidentiality language typical of the insurer\u2019s communications.\n\nAt 10:07 AM on October 10, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded. She opened with gratitude for Kristi Woods\u2019s quick response that morning and then reiterated the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s position. Specifically, she acknowledged the insurer\u2019s stance on TTD benefits but emphasized that the documents related to the calculations of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s Average Weekly Wages were being requested. She clarified that they were not asking the insurer to initiate TTD at this time; that would be addressed with Mrs. Smith. Regardless of the TTD status, she maintained that the Whaley Law Firm was entitled to a copy of the documents used to calculate such benefits, a request that had been outstanding since the initiation of the claim. Sarena closed with her standard sign-off and contact information.\n\nOn November 9, 2024, Debbie Smith, Sr. Claims Examiner for ClearPath Specialty Insurance, replied to Sarena. Debbie confirmed that she was sending a request to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s employer for a copy of his wages. She explained that, because this was a medical-only claim, she had not previously requested wages. Debbie noted that the wages listed on the FROI were $10.00 per hour for 40 hours per week, equating to $400.00, and she said she would follow up with the employer for a response. She invited Sarena to let her know if anything else was needed. Debbie attached her contact details, including direct line (502) 315-4280 and main line (800) 638-3669, and included her email signature. The message also contained the standard confidentiality notice and the insurer\u2019s social media icons, along with a customary warning about making fraudulent claims and the confidentiality restrictions for recipients.\n\nSeveral related communications from 2024 also appear in the record. A prior message from Kristi Woods, dated October 10, 2024 at 10:02 AM, referenced Debbie\u2019s file notes and ongoing work on PT X12, and again noted the need to obtain medical records to assess TTD and overall medical status before moving forward. The record also shows Debbie\u2019s earlier note that the wage calculation on the FROI had already been captured as $10.00 per hour for 40 hours, totaling $400, and that additional wage records would be pursued if needed.\n\nFinally, the document includes the initial email from January 20, 2025, in which Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Debbie Smith and cc\u2019d Bryce Koon. In this message, Sarena referenced Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s AWW documents from his employer and reiterated that the wage structure on the FROI did not reflect typical CDL driver pay. She noted that CDL drivers are usually paid more than $10.00 per hour and often receive some form of per-mile pay on top of their hourly rate. Therefore, she requested that Nathan Bennett Trucking\u2019s payroll records be forwarded as soon as possible. Sarena signaled that the new email address should be used for future correspondence and provided her direct line (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, along with her email address.\n\nIn sum, the communications trace a concerted effort from The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena Tuttle) to obtain employer wage records and the calculations used to determine Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s Average Weekly Wages, in the context of a medical-only workers\u2019 compensation claim arising from a motor vehicle accident (case MVA-02-15-2024) involving Christopher Wilkerson (claim number 238042). The involved insurer representatives ( Debbie Smith and Kristi Woods) discussed the status of medical records, PT authorization, and the potential impact of TTD, while repeatedly reaffirming the need for the employer\u2019s wage data and payroll records from Nathan Bennett Trucking.",

The claim appears to be medical-only at this point, with ongoing treatment and potential disability considerations.\nThe most recent activity involves attempts to obtain Mr. Wilkerson's wage information from his employer. The insurance company reported that Mr. Wilkerson was paid $7,597.11 for 2024, which is significantly different from the initially reported $10/hour wage. (See details)\nA potential red flag is the discrepancy in Mr. Wilkerson's reported wages. The employer initially reported $10/hour for 40 hours/week, but later indicated a 1099 payment of $7,597.11 for 2024, which calculates to a much higher weekly rate. This inconsistency, along with the use of a 1099 form for a seemingly W-2 employee, raises concerns about the accuracy of wage reporting. (See details)\nThe next steps should include following up on the chiropractic treatment narrative from Dr. Leonard at Taylor County Chiropractic. Dr. Leonard anticipates providing a partial disability rating and recommending future treatment twice a month indefinitely. A follow-up call was requested if the narrative is not received within a week. (See details)",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024\nClient: Christopher Wilkerson\n\nRE: Christopher Wilkerson 238042\n\nIn a chain of communications regarding Mr. Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim (238042), Debbie Smith, Senior Claims Examiner for Clearpath Specialty Insurance, sent a message on January 20, 2025, to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with Bryce Koon copied. Debbie reported that she had sent out several wage requests and had been able to call the employer\u2019s office. She advised that she would email the wage request to the employer and asked that it be completed. Debbie noted that the employer indicated she had sent Mr. Wilkerson his 1099 form, which showed he was paid $7,597.11 for 2024. Debbie stated that once she received the wages, she would email a copy to the recipients. She signed the message and included a standard notice about faxing claim documents to 410-420-3002 and referencing the claim number. Her contact details were provided, including direct and main line numbers, and the message carried the confidentiality disclaimer typical of such communications.\n\nSarena Tuttle, in response later that same day, acknowledged the note and addressed the wage documentation issue. In her reply dated January 20, 2025 at 1:42 PM, she referenced the holiday season and circled back to the matter of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s AWW (Average Weekly Wages) documents from his employer. Sarena explained that the FROI (First Report of Injury) shows $10.00 per hour for 40 hours per week, which is not typical for a CDL driver pay type. She remarked that CDL drivers are usually paid more than $10.00 per hour and often have a per-mile or other additional rate on top of their hourly pay. She requested that Nathan Bennett Trucking\u2019s payroll records be forwarded as soon as possible. Sarena provided her contact details and noted the newly updated email address for her correspondence.\n\nEarlier in the chronology, Debbie Smith had written to Sarena on Saturday, November 9, 2024, to confirm that she was sending a request to the employer for a copy of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s wages. Debbie explained that, since this claim was medical-only, she had not requested wages initially. She stated that she had Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s wages on the FROI as $10.00 per hour times 40 hours, equating to $400.00, and she would follow up with the employer for a response. Debbie offered to assist further if needed and again included the fax instruction and her signature block with confidential-disclaimer language.\n\nAlso in the earlier communications, there is a thread on October 10, 2024. At 10:07 AM, Sarena Tuttle forwarded a message to an external address, clarifying that while she understood the employer\u2019s position on TTD (Temporary Total Disability) benefits, they were requesting documents related to the calculations of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s Average Weekly Wages. She stated that they were not currently asking the employer to initiate TTD, a matter to be addressed with Mrs. Smith. Regardless of the TTD status, she asserted that they were entitled to a copy of the documents obtained to calculate such benefits and that this request had been outstanding since the initiation of the claim.\n\nEarlier on October 10, 2024, Kristi Woods (Claims Examiner for Clearpath Specialty Insurance) replied at 10:02 AM. In her message, she referred to Debbie\u2019s file notes from August 13, 2024, noting that Debbie had approved physical therapy (PT X12) and was waiting on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s medical records to review any mention of TTD or medical status. Kristi indicated that once those records were received, they would have a better idea of how to move forward.\n\nThe Oct. 10, 2024 correspondence also includes a prior exchange in which Kristi Woods, in a separate message, acknowledged the ongoing exchange of documents and the need to obtain Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s average weekly wage information for the claim. The record shows additional notes and a printed \u201cPlease Note\u201d about faxing documents to 410-420-3002 and referencing the claim number, consistent with the standard practice in this file, though some elements appeared as placeholders or were not fully rendered in the excerpt.\n\nThere is also a forward from Sarena Tuttle dated October 10, 2024, which begins with a light, system-generated header about the sender\u2019s email address. In the body, Sarena addressed Mrs. Woods and requested \u201cour treatment update & request for any and all documents related to Mr. Wilkerson's average weekly wages.\u201d She explained that Mrs. Smith would be out for the remainder of the week but emphasized the desire to obtain these documents promptly. The note ended with an unfinished sentence, \u201cAlso, please let Mrs. Smith know that your email o\u2026,\u201d suggesting the message was truncated in the record.\n\nThe record also includes an email from Debbie Smith to Sarena dated earlier in 2024, confirming the pattern of wage request activity and the ongoing exchange of wage-related documents, though the specifics beyond what is already summarized above are not fully captured in the excerpt.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly emphasized the confidentiality and privacy of the communications, attached files, and the fact that review of wages and calculations of Average Weekly Wages would inform the determination of benefits. The dialogue reflects efforts to obtain employer wage records (including 1099 forms and payroll data) to reconcile the FROI wage figures ($400 per week based on $10/hour for 40 hours) with any other reported compensation (notably the $7,597.11 shown on the 1099 for 2024) for Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim. The aim was to verify AWW, evaluate potential TTD implications, and ensure all calculations and documents were properly exchanged between the insurer and the employer, with the law firm representing the claimant seeking timely production of these records.",

On March 19, 2025, with the client\u2019s permission, Mr. Koon advised Ms. Smith that they were prepared to resolve the claim against the insured and to submit a confidential settlement demand for consideration. The demand totaled $42,703.85 and was itemized as follows: first, PPD benefits calculated in accordance with statutory calculations based on an Average Weekly Wage of $1,051.35 (as previously provided by Ms. Smith) and an 8% functional impairment rating determined by Dr. Jessica Leonard, Wilkerson\u2019s treating physician, resulting in a lump-sum PPD value of $17,703.35; a printout of this calculation was attached. Second, future medical expenses for physical therapy and pain management as indicated by Dr. Leonard\u2019s report, estimated at approximately $15,000.00, conservatively projected at $1,000.00 annually for the next 15 years. Third, $10,000.00 for all additional waivers related to Wilkerson\u2019s claim, including the right to reopen. Mr. Koon closed by thanking Ms. Smith for her consideration and expressing a hope to hear from her soon. The message concluded with the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nFollowing that, on April 3, 2025 at 10:48 AM, Mr. Koon again reached out to Debbie Smith with a brief follow-up: \u201cGood morning Debbie, Just wanted to follow up on this one. Any update appreciated.\u201d This message likewise carried the Whaley Law Firm signature block and the same attorney-client privilege notice.\n\nMost recently, on April 9, 2025, at 4:09:41 PM Eastern Time, Mr. Koon reiterated the approach with a short note: \u201cGood afternoon Debbie, Circling around on this one again.\u201d The message again was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and included the same contact details (phone: 502-365-5043; fax: 502-237-3207) and the same confidentiality disclaimer. The email was addressed to Debbie Smith, with cc to notifications@hm1842.com, Sarena Tuttle, and Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s Filevine project email address, and bore the subject line \u201cRe: Christopher Wilkerson (AFC 230577703).\u201d The thread also references the earlier content by virtue of the included signatures and standard privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This matter concerns Christopher Wilkerson (AFC 230577703). The correspondence thread centers on settlement discussions and was led by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with the following contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207. The initial and subsequent messages were addressed to Debbie Smith at DSmith@hm1842.com, with CC copies to notifications@hm1842.com, Sarena Tuttle at sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, and Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s Filevine project email address ChristopherWilkersonWCMVAZ4472082@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The messages were dated April 9, 2025; April 3, 2025; and March 19, 2025.\n\nOn March 19, 2025 at 11:51 AM, Bryce Koon wrote to Ms. Debbie Smith with our client\u2019s permission to resolve the claim against your insured and to submit a confidential settlement demand for review. The proposed settlement demand totaled $42,703.85 and was itemized as follows: (1) PPD benefits calculated under the statutory method, based on an Average Weekly Wage of $1,051.35 (as provided in the AWW calculation you previously supplied) and an 8% functional impairment rating as provided by Dr. Jessica Leonard, Wilkerson\u2019s treating physician, yielding a lump-sum PPD value of $17,703.35; a printout of this calculation was attached. (2) Future medical expenses for physical therapy and pain management, as indicated by Dr. Leonard\u2019s report, approximately $15,000 (conservatively estimated at $1,000 per year for the next 15 years). (3) $10,000 for all additional waivers related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim, including the right to reopen. The email conveyed thanks for consideration and indicated a desire to hear back.\n\nOn April 3, 2025 at 10:48 AM, Bryce Koon followed up with Debbie Smith to request an update on the matter, again referencing the confidential nature of the communications and including the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and, if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or forward the information.\n\nOn April 9, 2025 at 4:09 PM, Bryce Koon, Esq., again addressed Debbie Smith. The subject line reflected the ongoing Re: Christopher Wilkerson discussion. The message stated, \u201cGood afternoon Debbie, Circling around on this one again. Thanks,\u201d and included the same firm signature and confidentiality disclaimer that such electronic communications are intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not use or forward the information to any third person not intended to receive it.\n\nThroughout these messages, the correspondence consistently referenced the client\u2019s agreement to consider settlement of the claim against the insured, the proposed settlement amount of $42,703.85 with its three-part breakdown, and the attached documentation supporting the PPD calculation. The communications also provided the firm\u2019s standard contact information and reiterated the privileged nature of the emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. The matter concerns Christopher Wilkerson, represented by The Whaley Law Firm, with file notes and communications spanning March and April 2025.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Debbie Smith, Sr. Claims Examiner at ClearPath Specialty Insurance, with the permission of their client, stating that they were in a position to resolve the claim of Christopher Wilkerson against the insurer and that they were submitting a confidential settlement demand for review. The demand totaled $42,703.85 and was itemized as follows: (1) PPD benefits calculated under statutory rules based on an average weekly wage of $1,051.35 and an 8% functional impairment rating as provided by Dr. Jessica Leonard, with the lump-sum value of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s PPD claim listed as $17,703.35 (a printout of this calculation was attached). (2) Future medical expenses for physical therapy and pain management, as indicated by Dr. Leonard\u2019s report, estimated at approximately $15,000.00 (conservatively estimated at $1,000.00 annually for the next 15 years). (3) $10,000.00 for all additional waivers related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim, including the right to reopen. The message concluded with thanks and the firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nThis March 19 communication appears to have been accompanied by a standard confidentiality notice and other boilerplate language typical of attorney-to-insurer correspondence, noting that the message was intended only for the named recipient and outlining confidentiality and privilege considerations. The contact details for The Whaley Law Firm were provided: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207.\n\nSubsequently, on April 3, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up with Debbie Smith, requesting any update and indicating appreciation for any progress. He again referenced the ongoing effort to resolve the claim and maintain contact regarding the confidential settlement demand.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Koon sent another note to Debbie Smith, circiling back to the matter and indicating ongoing attention to the issue. The correspondence included standard attorney-to-insurer formatting and boilerplate notices, with the email subject reflecting Re: Christopher Wilkerson (AFC 230577703). An explicit external-origin warning was included in this message, cautioning recipients about recognizing the sender and the safety of links or attachments.\n\nEarlier in the sequence, on April 10, 2025, Debbie Smith had replied. She stated that she had reviewed the IME report and had forwarded the report for further review. She indicated some disagreement with the IME, expected to complete the internal review by the end of the following week, and she asked for confirmation of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s current employment status and, if applicable, where he is employed.\n\nFinally, on April 29, 2025, Bryce Koon replied to Debbie Smith with a direct confirmation: Mr. Wilkerson is presently employed with H&O Transport, Inc., located at 350 Industrial Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718. The correspondence reaffirmed the client\u2019s ongoing employment status, and the email included Koon\u2019s standard firm signature block and contact information.\n\nThroughout this exchange, the messages contained customary confidentiality and privilege notices, with ongoing references to the IME review process and requests for further information about Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s current employment status. There were also notes within the April 10 message about a faxing instruction: if claim documents are faxed, they should be sent to 410-420-3002 with the claim number referenced.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson. This note is a compilation of email communications between counsel, claims personnel, and related parties concerning the motor vehicle accident/workers\u2019 compensation matter for Christopher Wilkerson (AFC 230577703). The messages include the settlement discussions and updates on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s employment status, as well as follow-up inquiries about the independent medical examination (IME) and the review of the claim.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a confidential settlement demand to Debbie Smith on behalf of Mr. Wilkerson. The demand totaled $42,703.85 and was itemized as follows: 1) PPD (permanent partial disability) benefits in accordance with statutory calculations, based on an Average Weekly Wage (AWW) of $1,051.35 (as previously provided) and an 8% functional impairment rating per Dr. Jessica Leonard, Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s treating physician, yielding a lump-sum PPD claim value of $17,703.35, with a printout of this calculation attached; 2) future medical expenses for physical therapy and pain management as indicated by Dr. Leonard\u2019s report, estimated at approximately $15,000.00 (conservatively projected at $1,000.00 annually for the next 15 years); and 3) $10,000.00 for all additional waivers related to Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s claim, including the right to reopen. The message closed with thanks for consideration and a note that the settlement demand was being submitted for the other side\u2019s review.\n\nOn April 3, 2025 at 10:48 AM, Bryce Koon followed up with Debbie Smith, writing: Good morning Debbie, just wanted to follow up on this one again. Any update appreciated. He included the standard confidentiality language within his message.\n\nOn April 9, 2025 at 4:10 PM, Bryce Koon again wrote to Debbie Smith: Good afternoon Debbie, circling around on this one again. The message contained the same confidentiality language as prior messages.\n\nOn April 10, 2025 at 12:09 PM, Debbie Smith replied to Bryce. She stated that she had reviewed the IME report, sent the report out for a separate review, and expressed that she did not necessarily agree with the IME report. She anticipated completing her own review by the end of the following week and asked Bryce to confirm whether Mr. Wilkerson is currently working, and if so, where.\n\nOn April 29, 2025 at 2:58 PM, Bryce Koon responded to Debbie Smith with a direct confirmation: Yes. Mr. Wilkerson is presently employed with H&O Transport, Inc., located at 350 Industrial Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718. He included the Whaley Law Firm contact information and maintained the standard confidentiality language found in the firm\u2019s emails.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Debbie Smith sent a reply at approximately 9:47 AM stating: Thank you. Still waiting on my review to come back. I have the claim to review for report Monday. I will keep you posted. Happy Derby! This message was transmitted within the usual confidentiality and privilege notice framework.\n\nThe May 1, 2025 message thread was forwarded with the subject Christopher Wilkerson (AFC 230577703). In this forward, Debbie Smith\u2019s May 1 note is included, along with the earlier communications noted above. The forward also contains the prior exchange in which Bryce Koon had confirmed Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s employment with H&O Transport, Inc. at 350 Industrial Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718. The forwarded chain contains external-origin warnings and numerous standard confidentiality, privilege, and receiving-in-error instructions typical of the firm\u2019s correspondence.\n\nThroughout these communications, the case name and number (Christopher Wilkerson, AFC 230577703) are repeatedly referenced, and the discussions focus on (1) whether to pursue or review the confidential settlement demand previously issued in the March 19, 2025 email, (2) the accuracy and review of the IME report, and (3) the status of Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s current employment to assess ongoing lost wage components and related matters. The claim file also contains the fact that Mr. Wilkerson was working for H&O Transport, Inc. at 350 Industrial Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718 at the time of these communications. The participants in these discussions include Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s counsel (The Whaley Law Firm, Bryce Koon, Esq.), Debbie Smith (Sr. Claims Examiner at Clearpath Specialty Insurance) and the CC\u2019d recipients in the thread (including the Christopher Wilkerson Filevine project address and other internal stakeholders).\n\nIn sum, the record documents a confidential settlement demand issued March 19, 2025 in the amount of $42,703.85 with a detailed breakdown (PPD $17,703.35 based on AWW $1,051.35 and 8% impairment per Dr. Leonard; future medical expenses approximately $15,000 ($1,000/year for 15 years); and waivers including the right to reopen $10,000), subsequent follow-up inquiries by counsel on April 3, April 9, and April 10, confirmation on Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s employment with H&O Transport on April 29, and a May 1, 2025 update from Debbie Smith indicating that her review was still pending with a note about an expected Monday report, accompanied by the Derby greeting. The May 1 forward also reiterates the prior communications and attachments referenced in the March settlement demand.",

Client: Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nIn the email thread concerning Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation motor vehicle accident claim (238042CS), dated communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Harford Mutual Insurance Group from late October to mid-November 2025. On October 27, 2025, Debbie Smith, Senior Claims Examiner for Harford Mutual, wrote that she had reviewed the file and noted that Mr. Wilkerson was last seen by the chiropractor in July 2025. She acknowledged the prior lump-sum settlement offer of $42,000 and stated that she had settlement authority to resolve the claim for a lump-sum amount of $7,500. She asked to know whether the claim could be resolved on that basis.\n\nOn October 29, 2025 at 2:02 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Ms. Smith. He thanked her for the update and indicated that there were records from August and September floating around that he would send over as soon as possible. He then stated that, in the meantime, Harford Mutual\u2019s offer would be respectfully declined. Nevertheless, in an effort to reach an amicable settlement, his office was prepared to decrease their demand to $38,000 for full and final closure of the claim.\n\nLater on October 29, 2025 at 4:46 PM, Debbie Smith responded, thanking Mr. Koon and saying she would watch for the updated records. She commented that she felt the parties were very far apart and indicated she may consider scheduling the claimant for an independent medical examination (IME).\n\nFinally, on November 18, 2025, at 01:52:39 GMT-05:00, Bryce Koon again addressed Debbie Smith. He forwarded updated records he had received from Taylor County Chiropractic and invited any questions or discussion about the claim, offering to be reached at the number listed below in his signature.\n\nThroughout this correspondence, the parties referenced ongoing settlement discussions and the potential for updating medical records (specifically from August and September) as the negotiations proceeded. Each electronic message included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be shared or used if received in error.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Christopher Wilkerson, WC-MVA-02-15-2024. Client: Christopher Wilkerson.\n\nThis narrative summarizes a series of email exchanges in late 2025 between The Whaley Law Firm, representing Christopher Wilkerson, and Harford Mutual Insurance Group, regarding the Christopher Wilkerson claim (238042CS). The emails, sent between October 27 and November 20, 2025, focus on settlement discussions and the exchange of medical records, with the usual attorney-client confidentiality notices included in each message. The May 2024 case involved a motor vehicle accident in the workers\u2019 compensation context.\n\nOn October 27, 2025, Debbie Smith, Senior Claims Examiner at Harford Mutual Insurance Group, wrote to W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm. She noted that Mr. Wilkerson was last seen by a chiropractor in July 2025 and reminded that there had been a prior lump-sum settlement offer of $42,000. She also stated that she had settlement authority to resolve the claim for a lump-sum amount of $7,500 and asked Mr. Koon to indicate whether the claim could be resolved. The message included Debbie Smith\u2019s contact information and the Harford Mutual disclaimer, and was cc\u2019d to Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s Filevine project email address.\n\nOn October 29, 2025, at 2:02 PM, Bryce Koon replied to Debbie Smith. He acknowledged that there were records from August and September that needed to be located and stated he would send them over ASAP. He also conveyed, on behalf of his client, that they must respectfully decline Harford Mutual\u2019s offer. However, in an effort to reach an amicable settlement, he said they were prepared to decrease their demand to $38,000 for full and final closure of the claim. He signed the message as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact information, and attached the customary confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, at 4:46 PM, Debbie Smith replied that she would watch for the updated records. She commented that she felt the parties were very far apart and indicated she might consider scheduling Mr. Wilkerson for an independent medical examination (IME). The message included Debbie Smith\u2019s contact details and the standard confidentiality disclaimer. The thread also shows that the correspondence continued to reference the same case and subject, Re: Christopher Wilkerson 238042CS.\n\nOn November 18, 2025, at 1:52 PM, Bryce Koon sent another message to Debbie Smith with the subject line Re: Christopher Wilkerson 238042CS. He stated that he was providing updated records he had received from Taylor County Chiropractic and invited Debbie to call him if she had questions or wished to discuss the claim. The message again included Bryce Koon\u2019s signature block and the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on November 20, 2025, at 5:01 PM, Bryce Koon wrote to Debbie Smith asking whether she had received the records he had sent. This message also carried the same confidentiality disclaimer and reflected the continuing exchange of records between the firm and the insurer as they pursued resolution of the claim.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the file references Mr. Wilkerson\u2019s July 2025 chiropractic visit, August and September records that were being gathered, the parties\u2019 ongoing settlement discussions (including a prior offer of $42,000 and an authority to settle for $7,500, with contemporaneous consideration of offers closer to $38,000 for full and final closure), and the potential for an IME as part of the resolution process. The communications were between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, Louisville, KY, and Debbie Smith, Senior Claims Examiner, Harford Mutual Insurance Group, with copy to Christopher Wilkerson\u2019s Filevine project address.",

      "natural_language": "The case Christopher-Wilkerson-WC-MVA-02-15-2024 for client Christopher Wilkerson has completed comprehensive file organization using an eight-bucket structure. Phase 1, Inventory, is complete: a total file inventory of 197 files was generated, .md filenames were scrambled to eliminate naming bias, and a PDF-to-MD mapping was created to aid reunification.\n\nPhase 2, Analysis & Mapping, is complete as well. Eleven parallel sub-agents were deployed to process the 197 files (approximately 40 per agent), and work proceeded in three batches: 4, 4, and 3 sub-agents. A comprehensive reorganization map was created for 170 files, with the proper naming convention applied: YYYY-MM-DD - Client Name - Category - Originator - Description. Additionally, 11 duplicate files were identified for deletion.\n\nPhase 3, Quality Review, is finished with an error rate of 2.35% (4 errors out of 170 files). The main agent corrected those 4 errors: 3 category errors were fixed (Litigation revised to Insurance/Client/Case Information), 1 date error was corrected (injury date changed to form completion date), and a multi-case document was approved for split (a PIP worksheet that included unrelated lien letters).\n\nPhase 4, Execution, is complete as well. There were 164 file operations, and 217 files were moved into the proper eight-bucket structure. The distribution was as follows: Case Information: 2 files (PPD Calculator); Client: 57 files (intake forms, WC forms, health insurance cards); Investigation: 13 files (police report, accident photos, driver license); Medical Records: 64 files (treatment notes, MMI reports, HIPAA authorizations); Insurance: 76 files (WC/PIP correspondence, policy documents); Expenses: 1 file (LexisNexis receipt); Negotiation Settlement: 2 files (settlement demand); Litigation: 2 files (employment history form). Eleven duplicate files were deleted, and PDFs were reunified with their .md companions.\n\nPhase 5, Verification, is complete. All eight bucket directories were created successfully, and all moved files follow the proper naming convention with no loose files remaining in the root directory. Minor cleanup remains: 49 EML files require .md companions, and 4 orphaned hash files require review.\n\nCase context: this is a Workers\u2019 Compensation plus motor vehicle accident case involving a dump truck rollover on 02/15/2024. The client reached maximum medical improvement on 01/07/2025 with a 5\u20138% functional impairment rating. The workers\u2019 compensation carrier is Hartford Mutual (Clearpath), Claim #238042. The PIP carrier is Kentucky Farm Bureau, Claim #04943051.\n\nResult: the case file is now organized with the proper eight-bucket structure and a standardized naming convention. Files are properly categorized and easily retrievable. Quality metrics show 97.65% accuracy in categorization and 100% accuracy in duplicate detection.",
