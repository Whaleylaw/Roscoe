Networks USA XIV, Inc., et al., with the client identified as Kimberly Brasher and the file labeled Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. The communications revolve around whether Walgreens should be added as a defendant in the matter and how to handle potential liability of the previously named defendants.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Lee E. Sitlinger of Sitlinger & Theiler and to Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine project email address. In the body of the message, Whaley said, \u201cLee, see the attached letter I received from Sedgwick regarding Walgreens. It seems as if they are maintaining that they are not responsible. I think the Agreed Order would just be to add Walgreen's as a defendant.\u201d The message was dated Thursday, May 16, 2024, at 12:39:36 -0400. The note includes Whaley\u2019s contact information at the Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; 502-583-4022) and the various recipients\u2019 contact details.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on April 24, 2024, Lee Sitlinger replied to the matter, writing, \u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll send over a proposed order for your review and approval.\u201d This response is recorded in the email thread with the header showing Sitlinger\u2019s law firm at 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, KY 40222, and his contact information (lsitlinger@sitlingerlaw.com; 502-589-2627 x 703; 502-583-3415 fax).\n\nAlso on April 24, 2024, at 1:11 PM, Aaron Whaley sent an email to Sharon Archer with copies to Lee Sitlinger, Bryce Koon, and Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine project address regarding the same case. In his message, Whaley stated that he was \u201cfine with doing an Agreed Order substituting in Walgreens so long as if evidence comes out showing the removed defendants have liability we can add them back. I just want to make sure Walgreens does not point the finger against an empty chair. Thanks.\u201d\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 12:59 PM, Sharon Archer, Legal Assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger, wrote to counsel: \u201cDear Counsel: Attached is a copy of Attorney Lee Sitlinger\u2019s correspondence regarding the above-referenced matter.

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co., et al., McClean Circuit Court, No. 24-CI-00012, the client Kimberly Brasher is represented by The Whaley Law Firm. On July 16, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, conveyed a scheduling question to Sharon K. Archer, the Legal Assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger at Sitlinger Law. Tuttle noted that, although they would prefer not to push the claim far into the future, they would likely want to schedule deposition of the Walgreens Representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance for the same day as Kimberly Brasher\u2019s deposition, and asked for dates when both offices would be available. Tuttle\u2019s signature included her contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note that this is her new email address.\n\nEarlier that morning, at 9:57 AM, Sharon Archer informed Sarena that her firm represents Walgreens Co. in the above-referenced matter and that Mr. Sitlinger would like to schedule Kimberly Brasher\u2019s deposition sometime in October at Walgreens\u2019 office, requesting as soon as possible to provide Mr. Whaley\u2019s or Mr. Koon\u2019s availability in October 2024, with the exception of October 16\u201325. Archer provided Sitlinger Law\u2019s contact details: 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, KY 40222; sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com; Telephone (502) 589-2627 x 708; Facsimile (502) 583-3415.\n\nEarlier still, in Archer\u2019s note, there is a response indicating a preference for October dates, with a clarification that Sitlinger would like to begin with October rather than September. At 10:53 AM, Archer wrote back: \u201cNo, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Sitlinger wants to start with October dates. Thank you.\u201d This was followed by Archer reiterating Walgreens\u2019 position that the deposition of Ms. Brasher be scheduled in October in Walgreens\u2019 office, and asking for the availability of Whaley\u2019s or Koon\u2019s schedules in October 2024 to take Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition, specifically excluding October 16\u201325.\n\nFinally, at 11:51:10 AM on July 16, 2024, Sarena responded with a plan: while they would prefer not to push the claim too far into the future, they would likely want to schedule the Walgreens Representatives\u2019 deposition for the same day as Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition. She requested that Archer provide dates on which both Sitlinger Law and Walgreens\u2019 Representative would be available. This message also reiterated Sarena\u2019s contact details and noted her new email address.",

Walgreen Co., et al., McClean Circuit Court No. 24-CI-00012, a July 16, 2024 email chain among counsel documents scheduling discussions for depositions related to the case.\n\nThe sequence begins with Sharon Archer, Legal Assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger of Sitlinger Law, writing from sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com to Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com). In her message, Sharon notes that she has forwarded Sarena\u2019s email to Mr. Sitlinger, who is currently out of the office, and states that they will have to get back to Sarena regarding her email. The message is dated July 16, 2024 at 16:10:30 +0000. Sharon\u2019s signature indicates she is with Sitlinger Law, located at 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, and provides her contact details: sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com, telephone (502) 589-2627 x 708, and facsimile (502) 583-3415.\n\nEarlier in the day, Sarena Tuttle had sent a message (dated July 16, 2024) in which she stated that, while they would prefer not to push the claim far into the future, they would likely want to schedule the deposition of Walgreens Representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance for the same day as the deposition of Kimberly Brasher. She requested dates on which both Sharon\u2019s office and the Walgreens Representative would be available.\n\nThe chain shows an earlier reply from Sharon Archer, sent at 9:57? AM, in which she confirms that Walgreens Co. represents the defendant in the matter and states that Mr. Sitlinger would like to schedule the deposition of Kimberly Brasher for some time in October in Sitlinger\u2019s office. Sharon asks for availability in October 2024 for Mr. Whaley or Mr. Koon to take Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition, with the exception of October 16\u201325. Her message includes her full signature with contact information and the firm\u2019s address: SITLINGER LAW, 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com; telephone (502) 589-2627 x 708; facsimile (502) 583-3415.\n\nA follow-up from Sarena at 10:15 AM asks Sharon if there are any dates in September, expressing openness to scheduling in that month.\n\nSharon replies at 10:53? AM, clarifying that Mr. Sitlinger prefers to start with October dates.\n\nThe thread then returns to Sarena at 11:51 AM, noting that although they would rather not push the claim far into the future, they will likely want to schedule the deposition of the Walgreens Representatives (who oversaw the property and its maintenance) for the same day as Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition, and asking Sharon to provide dates on which both The Whaley Law Firm and the Walgreens Representative would be available.\n\nIn sum, the parties are coordinating deposition dates for Kimberly Brasher and for Walgreens Representatives (the representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance), with October 2024 identified by Mr. Sitlinger as the starting window, subject to availability and an exception for October 16\u201325. The record captures multiple rolling attempts to align schedules, including requests for September options, and a note that Sharon forwarded Sarena\u2019s email to Mr. Sitlinger, who is temporarily out of the office and would respond when available.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co., et al. (McLean Circuit Court, No. 24-CI-00012). The client is Kimberly Brasher.\n\nOn July 16, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Sharon Archer of Sitlinger Law regarding scheduling for the Brasher case. In her message, Tuttle thanked Archer and noted her new email address, providing her contact information and role (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext. 104; Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com). The subject referenced the case and court.\n\nThe email thread shows a sequence of back-and-forth on July 16, 2024. At 9:57 a.m., Archer informed Tuttle that Sitlinger would like to schedule the deposition of Kimberly Brasher for October 2024 at Walgreens\u2019 office and asked for the availability of Whaley\u2019s attorney (Mr. Whaley) or Mr. Koon in October, excluding October 16 through October 25, and to provide dates when both offices would be available. At 10:15 a.m., Tuttle replied that she would be interested in September dates if available. At 10:53 a.m., Archer responded that Sitlinger\u2019s preference was to start with October dates. At 11:51 a.m., Tuttle replied that although the claim would be preferable to push out less, they would likely want to schedule the deposition of the Walgreens representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance on the same day as Brasher\u2019s deposition, and she requested dates when both offices and the Walgreens representative could be available. After that, at 12:10 p.m., Archer wrote that she had forwarded Tuttle\u2019s email to Mr. Sitlinger, who was out of the office, and that they would have to respond later. Finally, at 12:11 p.m., Tuttle responded, \u201cAwesome. Thank you so much Sharon.\u201d\n\nArcher\u2019s signature identified her as the Legal Assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger at Sitlinger Law, including the firm\u2019s address at 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, KY 40222, and contact details: sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com, (502) 589-2627 x 708, and fax (502) 583-3415.

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher. This matter concerns Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co., et al., in McLean Circuit Court, No. 24-CI-00012.\n\nIn a July 22, 2024 email, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, addressed Sharon Archer and Curt Sitlinger (with Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon copied) regarding depositions in the Walgreens litigation. She thanked them for locating the best person to represent Walgreens for a deposition and requested an update once that representation is identified. She advised that Mr. Koon is available to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Brasher and noted that their October calendar is fairly open; she asked Walgreens to provide dates their office is available so they could discuss those dates with Ms. Brasher promptly. Her signature included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information, including the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe email chain also shows the ongoing scheduling discussion from July 16, 2024. Early that morning, Sharon Archer of Sitlinger Law informed Sarena that Walgreens represents Walgreens in the matter and that Mr. Sitlinger would like to schedule the deposition of Kimberly Brasher for sometime in October at Sitlinger\u2019s office, requesting availability in October 2024 for Brasher\u2019s deposition, with the exclusion of October 16\u201325. Sarena replied that, while they preferred not to push the claim far into the future, they would likely want to schedule the Walgreens representatives\u2014who oversaw the property and its maintenance\u2014to be deposed on the same day as Brasher, and she asked for dates when both offices could be available.\n\nSharon then clarified that Sitlinger wished to begin with October dates, rather than September. She asked for Mr. Whaley\u2019s or Mr. Koon\u2019s availability in October 2024 to depose Ms. Brasher, with the exception of Oct. 16\u201325. In response, Sarena reiterated the request for October dates and, when appropriate, September dates as well. She provided her contact details and reiterated the preference to schedule the deposition on October dates.\n\nThe thread continued with a brief exchange indicating Sharon would forward the message to Mr. Sitlinger, who was out of the office, and that they would have to get back to Whaley Law regarding the email. Sarena thanked Sharon for the update. The correspondence reflects the parties\u2019 efforts to coordinate the deposition of Kimberly Brasher and the Walgreens representatives on the same day, with October 2024 identified as the initial target window and October 16\u201325 excluding, along with a request for mutual availability.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co., et al. (McLean Circuit Court, No. 24-CI-00012), the scheduling of Ms. Kimberly Brasher\u2019s deposition became the subject of a series of emails between counsel for Walgreens and counsel for the plaintiff, starting in mid-July 2024. On July 16, 2024, Sharon K. Archer, the legal assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger at Sitlinger Law, informed Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm that Walgreens\u2019 litigation team would like to schedule Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition for October in their office, requesting availability for any October dates other than October 16\u201325. Archer identified the matter as representing Walgreen Co. and provided contact details for her firm: Sitlinger Law, 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com; telephone 502-589-2627 x708; fax 502-583-3415.\n\nAlso on July 16, Sarena Tuttle replied seeking dates in September as a possibility and noting Walgreens\u2019 preference to schedule for October, with the understanding that Sitlinger\u2019s firm would provide availability for October 2024 to take Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition at their office, excluding Oct. 16\u201325. In the interim, she suggested coordinating with Walgreens\u2019 representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance to possibly appear on the same deposition date. Sharon Archer responded that she had forwarded the email to Mr. Sitlinger, who was currently out of the office, and that they would respond when he returned.\n\nLater that same day, July 16, Sarena acknowledged Sharon\u2019s update with a brief \u201cAwesome. Thank you so much.\u201d The email correspondence continued over the next several days, with Sharon explaining that Mr. Sitlinger would prefer to begin with October dates, and Sarena asking for the availability of Mr. Whaley or Mr. Koon in October 2024 to take Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition, noting the dates to avoid were October 16\u201325. The thread shows ongoing back-and-forth while Sitlinger was out of the office, and Sarena indicating a desire to align dates for Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition along with any Walgreens representatives\u2019 deposition on the same day, if possible.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, Sarena sent a message reiterating appreciation for locating the appropriate Walgreens representative to handle the deposition and requesting an update once the information was obtained. She indicated that Mr. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm was happy to schedule the deposition of Ms. Brasher, and pointed out that October calendars were fairly open. She asked that Walgreens\u2019 office provide dates they were available so she could discuss them with Ms. Brasher as soon as possible. The message was copied to relevant parties, including Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon.\n\nFinally, on July 23, 2024, Sharon Archer responded with a list of October dates that were available for Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition: October 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16. Archer asked to advise whether any of those dates would work for Walgreens\u2019 office. Archer signed as the Legal Assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger of Sitlinger Law, providing her office\u2019s contact information and address: SITLINGER LAW, 320 Whittington Parkway, Suite 304, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; sarcher@sitlingerlaw.com; telephone 502-589-2627 x708; fax 502-583-3415. The message also lists the case details and indicates that the matter involves Walgreens Co., with depositions to be scheduled at the Sitlinger Law office, and references the deposition of the Walgreens representatives who oversaw the property and its maintenance. The exchange reflects ongoing coordination among The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena Tuttle, Curt Sitlinger, Greg Whaley, Bryce Koon) and Sitlinger Law (Sharon Archer) regarding timing and participants for the depositions in October.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co., McLean Circuit Court No. 24-CI-00012, the parties began coordinating the deposition schedule for Ms. Kimberly Brasher and, if needed, Walgreens\u2019 representative who oversaw the property and its maintenance. The exchange involved Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, and Sharon K. Archer, legal assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger at Sitlinger Law, with Curt Sitlinger and Greg Whaley also copied on the thread.\n\nThe planning kicked off on July 16, 2024, when Sharon Archer informed Sarena that Walgreens would like to schedule the deposition for October, to be held in Walgreens\u2019 office, and asked for Whaley\u2019s availability in October, noting that availability should exclude October 16 through 25. A few minutes later, Sarena requested dates in September as well, but Sharon clarified that the start should be in October and thanked her. Sarena then asked for both offices\u2019 availability in October so they could coordinate with Ms. Brasher and, later that day, Sharon acknowledged she would forward the request to Mr. Sitlinger, who was out of the office at the time, and said they would need to get back with a response. Sarena wrapped up that exchange by simply noting she appreciated the update.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, Sarena wrote again to Sharon and Curt Sitlinger, expressing appreciation for locating the best Walgreens representative for a deposition and noting that Mr. Koon was happy to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Brasher. With October fairly open in their calendar, she asked that Walgreens provide dates your office was available so those dates could be discussed with Mrs. Brasher.\n\nThe following day, July 23, 2024, Sharon provided Walgreens\u2019 available dates for Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition: October 1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 16. She asked for confirmation on which of those dates would work. Later that day, Sarena responded: October 1 at 10:00 a.m. sounded good. She added that if a Walgreens representative could be determined, they could be added in the afternoon if needed, and she asked whether a Zoom deposition would be preferable given that Mrs. Brasher lives about 2.5 hours away and the Walgreens representative\u2019s location was still undetermined.\n\nThroughout, the correspondence circulated among the following participants and roles:\n- Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, Louisville, KY.\n- Sharon K. Archer, legal assistant to Lee E. Sitlinger at Sitlinger Law, Louisville, KY.\n- Curt Sitlinger, attorney at Sitlinger Law.\n- Greg Whaley, attorney at The Whaley Law Firm.\n- Bryce Koon, associated with The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nAll communications reference the case\u2019s procedural posture and the practical considerations of scheduling: confirming October as the target month, identifying available dates for Ms. Brasher\u2019s deposition at Walgreens\u2019 office (and possibly coordinating with a Walgreens representative), and evaluating the option of conducting the deposition by Zoom due to distance and the yet-undetermined location of the Walgreens representative.",

      "natural_language": "Chronology of communications regarding Kimberly Brasher\u2019s lien (case reference 20240514-001078) documents a short, three-message exchange between The Phia Group and The Whaley Law Firm in early October 2024.\n\nOn October 4, 2024, at approximately 10:06 AM, Sarah Bracken of The Phia Group emailed Sarena Tuttle regarding Kimberly Brasher. Sarah noted that it appeared dates of service were missing from the latest lien list because some items had been coded for \u201cjoint disorder\u201d rather than being specific to the hip. She asked whether these dates should be added from Commonwealth Pain Associates and asked for confirmation on whether all such records should be included.\n\nOn October 9, 2024, at 1:38 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied. She apologized for the delayed response, explaining she had been out of the office at the end of the previous week. She confirmed that Sarah should include any and all records. She invited further questions or concerns to be discussed directly. Sarena provided her contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting it as her new email address.\n\nThat same message contains the standard informational and confidentiality disclaimers typical of the correspondence. The notices make clear that the information is informational only, not a substitute for legal counsel, does not create an attorney-client relationship, and is confidential and intended only for the addressed entity. The Phia Group emphasizes that it is not a law firm and is not responsible for any claims coverage decisions or payment. The notices reiterate the need to seek licensed legal counsel and advise deletion if received in error. Similar language appears again in later notes.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, at 17:43:24 UTC, Sarah Bracken sent a follow-up email to Sarena. She stated that it may be easier to include the dates of service missing from the lien. Her closing included her full signature information: Senior Recovery Specialist, The Phia Group, LLC; Phone/Fax: 502-213-5734; LinkedIn follow prompt. The email also provided two payment addresses that appeared in the thread, and a request to include the case number with payments: \"PAYMENTS SHOULD BE MAILED TO, P.O. BOX 499, CANTON, MA 02021\" (in this message) along with the case number. The message again referenced her manager, Jamie Johnson (JJohnson@phiagroup.com), and stated that both she and Jamie value the recipient\u2019s feedback. Her signature line also included the standard business disclaimers that accompany the correspondence.\n\nAdditionally, the thread contains several embedded image references (cid:image001.png, cid:image002.png, cid:image003.png) associated with the October 10 message, indicating the presence of attached visuals in that email.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, references appear to the same subject line: \"Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078\" and/or \"Re: Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078.\" The communication trail also includes an earlier note about where payments should be mailed (P.O. Box 390, Canton, MA 02021) in the October 4 message, contrasted with the later instruction to mail payments to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021. The Phia Group\u2019s branding elements, including \u201cFollow Us On LinkedIn!\u201d and the manager contact, Jamie Johnson, recur in the signatures.\n\nIn summary, the exchange shows a collaborative effort to ensure all relevant dates of service are captured for the lien, with The Whaley Law Firm requesting that all records be included, and The Phia Group seeking confirmation and offering guidance on where to send payment and whom to contact for feedback. The chain also includes multiple standard confidentiality and informational-use disclaimers and indicates a change in Sarena Tuttle\u2019s listed email address to Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher. The matter titled \u201cRe: Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078)\u201d centers on communications between The Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group regarding Kimberly Brasher\u2019s claim. The exchange includes the following participants and details.\n\nOn October 4, 2024, Sarah Bracken of The Phia Group wrote in a message beginning Good morning. She stated that she had received a voicemail about Kimberly Brasher and indicated that some dates of service were not included in the latest lien list because they had been coded for joint disorder rather than hip-specific. She asked whether those dates should all be added from Commonwealth Pain Associates and closed with her signature, which included her title as Senior Recovery Specialist, The Phia Group, LLC, payment mailing address (P.O. Box 390, Canton, MA 02021), and a note that her manager Jamie Johnson (JJohnson@phiagroup.com) and she valued feedback. \n\nOn October 9, 2024 at 1:38 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; please note the new email address), responded with an apology for the delayed reply due to being out of the office at the end of the prior week. She confirmed that the recipient should include any and all records they may have and invited them to contact Whaley Law Firm directly to discuss any questions or concerns. \n\nThe next message, sent October 10, 2024 at approximately 1:43 PM by Sarah Bracken, reiterated her earlier point and suggested it would be easier to include the dates of service missing from the lien. Her signature noted her role as Senior Recovery Specialist at The Phia Group, LLC, with the same contact and payment mailing details as before, and she added that her manager Jamie Johnson (JJohnson@phiagroup.com) valued the recipient\u2019s feedback.\n\nLater that same day, October 10, 2024 at 1:57 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent another message to Sarah Bracken. In this note, she asked Sarah to refer to their original correspondence dated October 1, 2024 (which was attached) in which Whaley outlined in detail what they believed was missing and provided a complete treatment summary for reference and comparison. She again provided her contact information and emphasized the new email address for future correspondence.\n\nThe thread also contains the standard informational and confidentiality disclaimers typically included by The Phia Group. These placeholders indicate that the information is for informational purposes only, not a substitute for legal counsel, does not create an attorney\u2013client relationship, and is confidential or privileged. They remind recipients to contact the sender if the message is received in error and to delete it. The notices appear repeatedly in the chain, alongside the line stating that The Phia Group is not a law firm and is not responsible for claims decisions or payment unless explicitly stated.\n\nIn summary, the exchange documents a back-and-forth about missing dates of service and the need to augment the lien with hip-specific records, references to records from Commonwealth Pain Associates, and the inclusion of a complete treatment summary. It also notes the existence of an attached October 1, 2024 correspondence detailing what was missing and a complete treatment summary, and it confirms the communications and contact details among Kimberly Brasher\u2019s representatives, The Whaley Law Firm, and The Phia Group, including the updated email address for Sarena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023, concerning client Kimberly Brasher (case reference Kimberly Brasher, 20240514-001078), a sequence of email exchanges occurred in October 2024 between The Phia Group, LLC, represented by Senior Recovery Specialist Sarah Bracken, and The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager Sarena M. Tuttle.\n\nOn October 4, 2024 at 10:06 AM, Sarah Bracken asked Sarena whether there were dates of service missing from the lien, noting that some dates were not included because they had been coded for joint disorder rather than hip pathology. She asked whether all such dates should be added from Commonwealth Pain Associates. Bracken also provided payment instructions stating that payments should be mailed to P.O. Box 390, Canton, MA 02021. She included standard Phia Group contact details and reiterated that payments should include the case number, along with the manager\u2019s name, Jamie Johnson, and her own contact information.\n\nOn October 9, 2024 at 1:38 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied, apologizing for the delayed response due to being out of the office at the end of the previous week. She asked that Sarah Bracken include any and all records she might have, and she invited them to contact Whaley Law Firm directly to discuss any questions or concerns in further detail. Tuttle included her own and her firm\u2019s contact details and noted a new email address for herself.\n\nLater on October 9, 2024 at 1:43 PM, Sarah Bracken responded, suggesting that it may be easier to include the dates of service that are missing from the lien.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, at about 1:43\u20131:58 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied, informing Sarah Bracken that they should reference their original correspondence from October 1, 2024 (attached in the thread), which detailed what Whaley Law Firm believed to be missing as well as a complete treatment summary for reference and comparison. Tuttle reiterated her willingness to include any and all records and to discuss any questions or concerns further. She provided her contact details again, including her new Whaley Law Firm email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky office information.\n\nAlso on October 10, 2024, Sarah Bracken sent a follow-up noting that it might be easier to identify the missing dates of service from the lien and stating her intention to work with the claims department to add all the claims. She mentioned that she would discuss the matter after the claims were received and advised that she would be out of the office for the following week. Bracken again provided the payment instructions, reiterating that payments should be mailed to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021 and must include the case number, and she closed with her manager Jamie Johnson\u2019s contact information and a note that both she and Johnson value feedback.\n\nOn October 11, 2024 at 13:41:17 UTC, Sarah Bracken sent a final note stating that she would have the Phia Group claims department review to add all the claims and would discuss the matter once those were received. She noted she would be out of the office for the entire next week and would follow up upon her return. She again provided payment instructions (mail to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021, including the case number) and reiterated that her manager Jamie Johnson and she valued feedback. The email signature identified her as Senior Recovery Specialist for The Phia Group, LLC, with the phone/fax number 502-213-5734, and included standard branding and LinkedIn follow prompts.\n\nThroughout the thread, multiple confidentiality and informational-use boilerplate notices appeared, repeatedly stating that the information is for informational purposes only, not a substitute for legal counsel, does not create an attorney-client relationship, and is confidential. Several of these notices were included in the messages at various points in the correspondence.\n\nIn sum, the communications between The Phia Group and The Whaley Law Firm regarding Kimberly Brasher\u2019s case (20240514-001078) centered on identifying and adding missing dates of service to the lien (potentially involving Commonwealth Pain Associates), sharing and referencing the original October 1, 2024 correspondence and a complete treatment summary, and planning for the Phia Group\u2019s claims department to review and add all claimed items, with ongoing coordination and standard payment procedures and contact details maintained throughout.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023; Client: Kimberly Brasher. The matter at hand concerns the file identified as Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078). The exchange takes place in October 2024 between The Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group, with the subject line referencing the Kimberly Brasher case.\n\nOn October 11, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Sarah Bracken of The Phia Group. In her message, Tuttle said, \u201cGood morning Sarah, this is perfectly fine. Enjoy your vacation next week!\u201d and she signed with her full contact information, noting a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a direct line of 502-357-9971 and the office line 502-583-4022 ext 104. The message included the standard confidentiality notice and other routine email footers, and it referenced that the new email address should be noted.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarah Bracken replied from The Phia Group. She stated that she would have their claims department review to add all the claims and would discuss the matter once those claims were received; she would be out of the office the following week and would respond after returning. Bracken\u2019s signature identified her as Senior Recovery Specialist at The Phia Group, with the same phone and fax number (502-213-5734) and a note to follow The Phia Group on LinkedIn. The email also contained a line instructing that payments should be mailed to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021 and should include the case number, and it included a reminder that her manager, Jamie Johnson (JJohnson@phiagroup.com), and Bracken value feedback. The same message contained the long standard disclaimers about the informational nature of the communication and the absence of an attorney-client relationship.\n\nThe thread shows earlier correspondence from October 10, 2024, in which Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Sarah Bracken (cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon) stating, \u201cPlease see our original correspondence to you on 10.01.2024 (attached) where we outlined in detail what we believe to be missing as well as a complete treatment summary for you to reference & compare.\u201d Tuttle again provided her contact information and reiterated the new email address. The message also included the familiar confidentiality and legal disclaimers.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, earlier in the day, Bracken had written: \u201cHello, It may be easier if you include the dates of service you are missing from the lien.\u201d This note was followed by Bracken\u2019s standard signature block and the reminder about mailing payments to Canton, MA, with the case number included.\n\nOn October 9, 2024, at 1:38 PM, Tuttle replied to Bracken. In that message, she apologized for the delayed response due to being out of the office at the end of the prior week. She asked Bracken to include any and all records Bracken might have and invited further questions or concerns, offering to discuss them in more detail. This message carried Tuttle\u2019s full Whaley Law Firm signature and the same confidentiality disclaimers.\n\nOn October 4, 2024, Bracken had written: Good morning. She reported receiving Tuttle\u2019s voicemail regarding Kimberly Brasher and explained that there were dates of service not included in the latest list because they were coded for a joint disorder rather than being specific to the hip. Bracken asked whether these dates should be added from Commonwealth Pain Associates. Her message again included her standard signature and the usual disclaimers.\n\nThroughout the chain, the Emails included the Phia Group\u2019s and Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard disclaimers about confidentiality, the informational nature of the communication, and the absence of an attorney-client relationship. Notably, the chain shows two different mailing addresses for payments: P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021 (as stated by Sarah Bracken on October 11) and P.O. Box 390, Canton, MA 02021 (as stated by Bracken in Bracken\u2019s October 4 message). It also shows a cc\u2019d party, Bryce Koon, in the October 10 exchange. The case number consistently tied to the thread is 20240514-001078. The communications reflect that there were missing records and a complete treatment summary provided by The Whaley Law Firm in their October 1, 2024 correspondence (referenced in the October 10 message as attached). The thread also notes that the claims department at The Phia Group would review to add all the claims and that the parties would reconvene on the matter after those records were received, with Bracken out of the office for the following week.",

Thank you.\n\nReply to Client:\nGood morning Kim,\n I can definitely understand your frustration with the process, I greatly apologize that you were not better informed as to how long litigation typically takes. On a standard Circuit Court Case can take 2 years easily, without any snags or delays. Your claim however is right on track with that timeline. The Defense did make a speedy change and we do not anticipate a huge delay for the new counsel to catch up. We anticipate scheduling Mediation in the Spring, if the Defense is not open to settlement discussion once they are caught up. If you are being contacted by medical providers related to this claim, please advise them that the bills are in a pending litigation and feel free to provide our contact information to anyone attempting to collect them, please do not let them go into collections or cause any further issues for yourself. We are here to help you with those.

Client: Kimberly Brasher.\n\nInitial client contact on November 26, 2024, with Sarena regarding the ongoing claim for Kimberly Brasher. The client had sent an email explaining that she was not aware of anyone\u2019s retirement, the defense counsel changing, or any other factor that might be delaying the defendant\u2019s response to her claim. She stated that she expects hospitals and other medical providers to place a garnishment on her almost immediately, which created an urgent need to know whether a settlement is closer or no settlement is anticipated. She noted that she is not in regular contact with the office and asked for some leeway if she sounded pushy, since she began her claim more than a year ago and did not anticipate such a lengthy process.\n\nReply to Client: Sarena replied to Kim with empathy and clarity. She acknowledged Kim\u2019s frustration with the process and apologized for not keeping her better informed about how long litigation typically takes. She explained that a standard circuit court case can take about two years easily, absent snags or delays, and that Kim\u2019s claim is currently on track with that general timeline. She noted that the defense had made a rapid change and that they do not anticipate a significant delay for the new counsel to get up to speed. Mediation was anticipated to be scheduled in the spring, provided the defense does not remain closed to settlement discussions once they are caught up. Regarding bills from medical providers, Kim was advised to inform them that the bills are in a pending litigation and to feel free to share the firm\u2019s contact information with anyone attempting to collect them; she was cautioned not to let the bills go into collections or create further issues for herself, and the firm pledged to help with those matters.

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher. The note tracks an email chain about discovery requests from the defense counsel in Kimberly Brasher\u2019s premise liability claim, with the subject line The Defense Counsel's Discovery Requests.\n\nOn November 27, 2024, Kimberly Brasher sent an email to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with Bryce Koon copied, replying, \u201cThank you for the update. That is very helpful.\u201d\n\nIn the prior day\u2019s correspondence, November 26, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Kim explaining that she could understand Kim\u2019s frustration with the process and apologizing for not having been better informed about how long litigation typically takes. She noted that a standard circuit court case can take two years or more, without snags or delays, and that Kim\u2019s claim is on track with that timeline. She also mentioned that the defense had recently changed counsel and that they did not anticipate a significant delay for the new counsel to catch up. Mediation was anticipated in the Spring if the defense was open to settlement after they were caught up. Sarena advised Kim to inform medical providers who contact her that the bills are in pending litigation and to feel free to provide The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information to anyone attempting to collect them, to avoid garnishment or further issues. She reassured Kim that the firm could assist with those matters and invited any further questions. The message included Sarena\u2019s signature block with her title, the firm\u2019s name and address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and contact details: D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\n\nEarlier, on November 25, 2024, at 3:56 PM, Kimberly Brasher wrote expressing that she was not aware of anyone\u2019s retirement or the defense counsel changing, or anything else affecting the defendant\u2019s response to her claim. She stated she expected hospitals and other medical providers to garnish her wages any day and emphasized an urgent interest in finding out whether there was progress toward settlement or not. She apologized for sounding pushy, explaining that she had started her claim over a year ago and was not expecting such a lengthy process.\n\nThat same day, at 8:41 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Kim, asking Kim to explain her previous statement and asking, \u201cWho is suing you?\u201d She noted that Kim\u2019s deposition had been taken on October 1, 2024. She explained that the defense counsel had recently changed due to Mr. Sitlinger\u2019s retirement and that they did not anticipate any significant movement in Kim\u2019s case until after the New Year. She emphasized the need to allow the new counsel time to review the case and that, once they were caught up, they hoped to schedule mediation. However, she added that whether mediation could occur would depend on the new counsel\u2019s position, and that The Whaley Law Firm would reach out to discuss the next steps once they heard back from the new counsel.\n\nOn Saturday, November 23, 2024, at 11:59 AM, Kimberly Brasher wrote, \u201cHi Serena. This is my second attempt to reach out for any information on my case before I just let all of WKy and southern IN sue me. Thanks.\u201d She signed, \u201cKimberly K Brasher.\u201d\n\nPrior messages include Kim\u2019s earlier notes: on Friday, November 8, 2024, at 9:17 AM, she asked if there had been any update or recent movement regarding her Walgreens case. On Monday, September 16, 2024, at 10:24 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent a message attaching the Discovery Requests from the Defense Counsel in Kim\u2019s premise liability claim. She urged Kim to review the packet and call to discuss. Sarena acknowledged the packet could seem overwhelming but offered assistance in completing the task. She noted that several questions would not require answers because they were outside Kim\u2019s scope of information (such as which experts would be called at trial) and that there were requests for document production. She added that most documents would already be in Kim\u2019s file and she would not need to produce them a second time. The message concluded with Sarena\u2019s signature block, including her role, the firm\u2019s address, and contact information, and a note reiterating the \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nThe communications consistently reference a Walgreens-related premise liability claim, with discussions about discovery requests, anticipated timelines, changes in defense counsel due to retirement, and expectations regarding mediation and settlement, as well as guidance for managing medical bills during pending litigation. The email chain also notes The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and a new email address for Sarena.",

      "natural_language": "The matter concerns client Kimberly Brasher, referenced as Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023, with the case file designation 20240514-001078. On December 4, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Sarah Ingle Hobbs of The Phia Group (cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon) confirming receipt of information and noting that the two charges dated March 10 and March 12, both labeled \u201cUnknown Provider,\u201d for the amount of $17,270.50 each, appeared related. She asked for clarification on whether these charges are duplicative or if they reflect the same procedure performed at the beginning and again at the end of Mrs. Brasher\u2019s inpatient treatment, given that she was hospitalized from March 10 through March 12. Tuttle also provided her contact details and indicated a new email address.\n\nThe email chain shows prior correspondence beginning November 26, 2024, when Sarah Ingle indicated she had taken over the handling of the file. She stated that she had removed all claims marked \u201cclaim watcher LLC\u201d from the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s listing and had requested additional information from her claims department for claims marked \u201cProvider Unknown.\u201d She promised to forward the updated lien as soon as she received a response. In a reply dated November 27, 2024, Sarena Tuttle thanked Sarah for the update, said she would update their contact information, and looked forward to hearing from her.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarah Ingle emailed again, attaching the claim forms with additional provider information and asking Sarena to let her know if anything else was needed. Her message included her standard signature block with her role as Sr. Claim Recovery Specialist at The Phia Group, along with contact information (Phone: 502-213-5717; Fax: 502-213-5717) and a reminder to mail checks to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021.\n\nIn the December 4, 2024 message, Sarena acknowledged receipt and clarified the current issue: the two $17,270.50 charges on March 10 and March 12 from an \u201cUnknown Provider\u201d appeared related, but it remained to be determined whether they were duplicates or whether the same procedure occurred at the start and end of the inpatient stay for Mrs. Brasher, who was hospitalized March 10 through March 12. She reiterated that the charges were related information to be confirmed and included her contact details and new email address for future communications.\n\nThe correspondence thread also included the standard confidentiality and informational notices typical of Phia Group communications, which were repeated across the emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. The client is Kimberly Brasher. The correspondence centers on the file referenced as Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078) and a lien related to Claim #22303927700, with an invoice described as an adjustment or repricing of one of her claims on a specific date of service (DOS).\n\n chronology of the emails:\n\n- November 26, 2024. Sarah Ingle Hobbs of The Phia Group took over the handling of this file. She advised that she had removed all claims marked \u201cclaim watcher LLC\u201d from The Phia Group\u2019s listing and had requested additional information from the claims department for claims marked \u201cProvider Unknown.\u201d She stated that once responses were received she would forward the updated lien. She signed as a Senior Claim Recovery Specialist and included the standard check-mailing address for payments: Please mail all checks to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021.\n\n- November 27, 2024. Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, thanking Sarah for the update and noting that she would update their contact information and look forward to further communication.\n\n- December 3, 2024. Sarah Ingle sent an update with claim forms and additional provider information attached, asking Sarena to let her know if anything further was needed.\n\n- December 4, 2024. Sarena responded that she had received the forms and that the information would be considered related. She noted, however, that there are two charges for 03/10 and 03/12 labeled \u201cUnknown Provider\u201d for the same amount, $17,270.50. She asked for confirmation whether these are duplicative or if they represent the same procedure performed at the beginning and again at the end of Mrs. Brasher\u2019s inpatient treatment, given that she was hospitalized from 03/10 through 03/12.\n\n- December 12, 2024. Sarah Ingle forwarded the client\u2019s response regarding Claim #22303927700. She stated that 22303927700 is an invoice for repricing one of her claims on that DOS. The message notes the same check-mailing address (P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021) and the standard closing from The Phia Group. The email includes the typical confidentiality and non-attorney relationship disclaimers that accompany these communications, indicating the information is for informational purposes only and not legal advice, and that The Phia Group is not a law firm.\n\nOther details embedded in the thread:\n\n- The Whaley Law Firm contact person is Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line is (502) 357-9971, and the office line is (502) 583-4022 ext. 104. Her email, updated in the thread, is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\n- The Phia Group contact is Sarah Ingle Hobbs, Senior Claim Recovery Specialist, The Phia Group, LLC, with a phone and fax number of (502) 213-5717. The mailing address for checks is the same P.O. Box in Canton, MA.\n\n- The emails reference two specific claims: the internal file 20240514-001078 and Claim #22303927700. The DOS referenced in the December 12 correspondence is tied to the repricing invoice for that claim.\n\n- The communications note ongoing work on provider information and lien status, including the handling of claims marked \u201cProvider Unknown\u201d and the removal of certain claims from listing, as well as the need to determine whether certain charges are duplicates.\n\n- Throughout the thread, the standard disclosures accompany every message, reiterating that the information is informational only, not legal counsel, and that the Phia Group is not a law firm; any inadvertent use should be avoided and the information is confidential and limited to the intended recipient.\n\nIn summary, from late November to mid-December 2024, the Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group coordinated on Kimberly Brasher\u2019s file related to lien and claim 22303927700 (within the broader 20240514-001078 and the 2023 case Kimberly Brasher Premise). They addressed provider information, questioned two unknown-provider charges of $17,270.50 for 03/10 and 03/12 to determine if they were duplicates or a single procedure performed twice during Mrs. Brasher\u2019s inpatient stay, and they exchanged invoices and updates regarding repricing on the date of service.",

      "natural_language": "In the Kimberly Brasher matter (Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023) for client Kimberly Brasher, the December 2024 email correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group centers on lien accounting for claim 22303927700 and related charges tied to Kimberly Brasher\u2019s inpatient treatment in March.\n\nThe exchange began with Sarah Ingle of The Phia Group noting, on November 26\u201327, 2024, that she had taken over the handling of the file and had removed all claims marked \u201cclaim watcher LLC\u201d from the listing. She said she had requested additional information from her claims department for claims marked Provider Unknown and would forward the updated lien as soon as she received a response.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarah sent the claim forms with additional provider information and asked Sarena Tuttle to let her know if anything else was needed. Sarena replied on December 4 that the received items would be considered related. However, she flagged that there were two charges dated 03/10 and 03/12 attributed to an \u201cUnknown Provider\u201d for the same amount of $17,270.50. She asked the Phia Group to confirm whether these charges are duplicative or whether they represent the same procedure performed at the beginning and end of Kimberly Brasher\u2019s inpatient hospitalization, which lasted from March 10 through March 12.\n\nLater on December 12, 2024, Sarah Ingle wrote back with the client\u2019s response regarding Claim #22303927700, noting that 22303927700 is an invoice for repricing one of Brasher\u2019s claims on that date. In a follow-up message, Sarena Tuttle confirmed her review of the figures: she saw 22303927700 billed at $17,270.50 with $1,727.50 paid, and 22302277800 also billed at $17,270.50 with $5,921.08 paid. Since the billed amounts match for both invoices, she asked for clarification on which provider ultimately paid and exactly how much was paid, or whether both invoices were paid, totaling $7,648.58. Sarena concluded by providing her contact details and requesting that the provider information be clarified to determine the total paid amount.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012), the client is Kimberly Brasher. The case file notes the parties and the matter title, with the client\u2019s name explicitly identified as Kimberly Brasher.\n\nOn November 12, 2024, counsel began exchanging emails regarding discovery in this case. At 11:10 a.m., Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Matthew B. Steinberg, Co-Managing Partner at Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. The email was cc\u2019d to Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine project email address (KimberlyBrasherSFZ3954564@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and bore the subject Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012). The message included a security notice: \u201cThis is the first time you received an email from this sender (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com). Exercise caution when clicking links, opening attachments or taking further action, before validating its authenticity. Secured by Check Point.\u201d In the body, Koon stated that he had learned Kimberly Brasher had been substituted as counsel in the matter and asked for any progress made on the discovery requests previously served on August 28, and when responses might be expected. He requested any available update and closed with his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email also included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nLater on November 12, 2024, at approximately 1:40 p.m., Matthew B. Steinberg replied to Bryce Koon. Steinberg thanked Koon for the email and stated that he had just received the file and would likely need a few days to figure out what was going on. He asked if he could get back to Koon first thing next week, apologizing for the wait and promising to work as quickly as possible. Steinberg\u2019s signature identified him as Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., located at 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507. His phone number was listed as (859) 226-0057, with fax (859) 226-0059, and his email address matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com; the firm\u2019s website and the section listing various U.S. jurisdictions appeared in the signature as well.\n\nThe email chain also includes the initial \u201cFrom\u201d line showing Bryce Koon\u2019s November 12, 2024 message, which was sent from bryce@whaleylawfirm.com. In that message, Koon reaffirmed that he had been substituted as counsel in Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. and again asked whether there had been progress on the discovery requests previously served on August 28 or when responses could be expected. The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and it listed the firm\u2019s contact information: phone 502-365-5043, fax 502-237-3207. The email again carried the same standard privilege disclaimer, including the advisory about not forwarding the information to third parties and the instruction to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message had been received in error.\n\nFinally, on December 12, 2024, at 2:57:55 a.m. (GMT-05:00), Bryce Koon sent a follow-up to counsel regarding discovery in this matter. The subject line mirrored the case title, Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012). In the body, Koon wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on the discovery requests in this one. Any update appreciated.\u201d The message was again cc\u2019d to Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine project email address (KimberlyBrasherSFZ3954564@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The email continued with the standard privilege disclaimer, reiterating that the electronic communication was intended only for the named recipient and cautioning recipients who might have received the message in error not to use or forward the information. The signature block identified W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with the same Louisville contact details previously listed.\n\nIn summary, the record shows three substantive communications among the parties in November and December 2024 concerning discovery in Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co.: (1) an initial November 12 email from Bryce Koon asking for progress on discovery requests previously served on August 28 and when responses would be expected; (2) a November 12 reply from Matthew B. Steinberg indicating he had just received the file, would need a few days to assess the situation, and would follow up the following week; and (3) a December 12 follow-up from Bryce Koon requesting any update on the discovery requests. The communications include standard privilege notices and firm signatures, and the messages were cc\u2019d to Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine project email address.",

      "natural_language": "This note covers communications on November 12, 2024, regarding the matter Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co., McLean County, case number 24-CI-00012, in which the client is Kimberly Brasher. The email thread concerns substitution of counsel and requests for progress on discovery.\n\nFirst, at 11:10 a.m. on November 12, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Matthew B. Steinberg, Esq., the Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., with the subject Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012). Koon noted that counsel had been substituted on the case and asked whether there had been any progress on the discovery requests that had been served on August 28, or when responses might be expected. He requested any update in this regard. His message included his firm\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365-5043; fax (502) 237-3207. The CC field also included Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address (KimberlyBrasherSFZ3954564@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The email carried the standard attorney\u2011client privileged disclaimer stating it is intended only for the named recipient and advising that, if received in error, the sender should be contacted and that no privilege is waived by disclosure to the recipient. It also displayed a security notice indicating this was the first time the recipient had received an email from this sender and that the message was secured by Check Point.\n\nLater that day, around 1:40 p.m., Matt Steinberg replied: \u201cThanks for the email and nice to meet you. I have just received the file and probably need a few days to figure out what is going on. Would you be okay if I got back to you first of next week. I see you have been waiting a bit and am sorry for that. I promise to work as quickly as possible.\u201d Steinberg\u2019s signature lists his title as Co-Managing Partner \u2013 Lexington Office, Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., at 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507. His phone is (859) 226-0057, fax (859) 226-0059, and his email is matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com, with a web address of www.qpwblaw.com. The signature also includes the firm\u2019s practice locations across numerous states, listed in full. The email, like the prior message, contained the standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer. The chain shows that the prior message from Bryce included the line \u201cThis is the first time you received an email from this sender,\u201d along with the \u201cSecured by Check Point\u201d notice and the usual confidentiality notice.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher.\n\nIn the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012), the communications begin with an email chain involving counsel for the parties. On November 12, 2024, at 11:10 a.m., Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Matthew B. Steinberg of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., with Kimberly Brasher\u2019s Filevine Project email address copied in the CC line. The message, which included a warning that this was the recipient\u2019s first email from bryce@whaleylawfirm.com and a note that the message was secured by Check Point, stated that Bryce had been substituted as counsel in the case and asked whether there had been any progress on discovery requests previously served on August 28, and when responses might be expected. The email concluded with Bryce\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207, and a standard attorney-client privileged notice.\n\nAt 1:40 p.m. on the same day, November 12, 2024, Matthew B. Steinberg replied. He thanked Bryce, said it was nice to meet him, and explained that he had just received the file and would likely need a few days to understand the situation. He asked Bryce whether it would be alright to respond by the first part of the next week, acknowledged that Bryce had been waiting, apologized for the delay, and pledged to work as quickly as possible. Steinberg\u2019s signature identified him as Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., located at 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507, with phone 859-226-0057 and fax 859-226-0059. His email was matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com, and the firm\u2019s website was www.qpwblaw.com.\n\nEarlier in the thread, a previous message from Bryce Koon dated November 12, 2024 at 11:10 a.m. had informed Matthew Steinberg that he had been substituted as counsel in the matter and inquired about the status of discovery requests previously served on August 28 and the timing of any responses. This message also included Bryce\u2019s firm\u2019s contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer. The email bore the header \u201cKimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012).\u201d\n\nOn December 12, 2024, at 2:58 p.m., Bryce Koon sent another follow-up email to Matthew Steinberg regarding the discovery requests in this case, asking for any update and reiterating the request for a status. Bryce again provided his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe following day, December 13, 2024 at 9:05 a.m., Matthew Steinberg replied. He thanked Bryce for the message and stated that they were working on the requests. He added that he could not recall whether a demand had been sent in this matter, and if Bryce had sent one, he asked that Bryce forward it because he could not locate it in the file he had received.\n\nLater that same day, December 13, 2024 at 10:13 a.m., Bryce Koon responded with a message that included an attachment reference. He stated that he was sending documents and provided a Dropbox link to the relevant materials: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tqrnzqyt94qf1ergchw4f/Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf?rlkey=8lfk22d08o4z59ublt1q3ax6e&st=z9tiqqfc&dl=0. Bryce closed with thanks and reaffirmed his contact details for The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207). The message included the standard confidentiality notice common to attorney communications, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information, and instructing the recipient to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message or any attachment was received in error, with a reminder that no privilege waiver applies and that the information should not be used or forwarded to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nConfidentiality notices and standard formalities accompanied each of these messages, including the closing lines from the Whaley Law Firm and the Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer firm, with their respective contact information. In summary, the record reflects ongoing discovery discussions between The Whaley Law Firm, representing Kimberly Brasher, and Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., representing Walgreens Co., with multiple exchanges between November and December 2024, culminating in Bryce providing a Dropbox link to demand-related exhibits on December 13, 2024.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher. This record covers discovery communications in the case Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012).\n\nOverview of the matter and parties\u2019 counsel\nThe matter involves Kimberly Brasher as the client, with litigation against Walgreen Co. The correspondence spans several weeks in November and December 2024. The principal participants in these exchanges are W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, representing Kimberly Brasher, and Matthew B. Steinberg, Esq., Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., representing Walgreen Co. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details are 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-365-5043, fax 502-237-3207. Quintairos\u2019 Lexington Office is listed as 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507, with phone 859-226-0057 and fax 859-226-0059. Email addresses and a web presence for the firms are also noted in the correspondence. The messages include standard attorney-client privilege disclosures typical to electronic communications, stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and that any inadvertent receipt should be reported to the sending firm and not used or forwarded to others.\n\nChronology of discovery communications\n\n- November 12, 2024. The first recorded email in the thread from this date shows Matthew B. Steinberg writing to Bryce Koon regarding progress on discovery. Steinberg notes that he has just received the file and will likely need a few days to understand what is happening, and asks if Bryce is okay with him responding by early next week, apologizing for any delay. The message contains Steinberg\u2019s formal signature block and a standard privilege disclaimer.\n\n- December 12, 2024. Bryce Koon follows up with Steinberg about the discovery requests in the case, asking for any updates. Bryce provides his firm\u2019s contact details and reiterates the inquiry about the discovery progress. A standard privilege disclaimer is included in this and the other communications.\n\n- December 13, 2024 (morning). Steinberg replies that they are working on the discovery and asks Bryce to forward any demand if one had been sent, as he cannot locate a demand in the file he received. His signature block is included with his contact information and firm branding. A prior header line shows a partial \u201cFrom\u201d and an \u201cError! Filename not specified.\u201d note from the system.\n\n- December 13, 2024 (later that morning). Bryce responds with a greeting, \u201cGood morning Matthew,\u201d and says, \u201cPlease see attached.\u201d He provides a Dropbox link to relevant documents for the case: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tqrnzqyt94qf1ergchw4f/Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf?rlkey=8lfk22d08o4z59ublt1q3ax6e&st=z9tiqqfc&dl=0. Bryce states that if there is trouble with the link or questions arise, he should be contacted. He includes his signature block and the standard privilege disclaimer. An image placeholder is noted as \u201cImage removed by sender.\u201d in the body of the message.\n\n- December 23, 2024. Steinberg responds to the ongoing exchange, thanking the others and reporting that he has now gone through the file. He notes that \u201cLee had discovery complete and verified just before he transferred the file to me\u201d and asks whether Lee ever served these responses on the other side. His message includes his signature block and the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\n- December 27, 2024. Bryce Koon replies to Matthew Steinberg: \u201cGood afternoon Matthew, We have not received any discovery responses that I am aware of.\u201d He signs as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s full address and contact numbers. The message includes the firm\u2019s standard privilege disclaimer. The CC line for this message shows the ongoing referral of the Kimberly Brasher matter within the Filevine project and related project email address.\n\nAdditional case and submission context\nThe communications repeatedly reference discovery requests and the status of responses in the case. The subject line across the emails identifies the matter as \u201cKimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012).\u201d The case is tracked under the header \u201cCase: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023\u201d with the client listed as Kimberly Brasher. Several emails include or reference the Filevine project email address associated with Kimberly Brasher\u2019s premise, which appears in the CC lines of multiple messages. The messages also show an ongoing exchange about whether a discovery demand had been sent previously, and whether any discovery responses had been served, as well as links to supporting documents and exhibits intended to support the discovery process.\n\nIn sum\nBetween November 12 and December 27, 2024, counsel for Kimberly Brasher and counsel for Walgreen Co. exchanged questions and updates about the progress, service, and provision of discovery responses in the case Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012). The record shows attempts to locate a demand for discovery, the sharing of documents via a Dropbox link to relevant exhibits, and ongoing inquiries about whether discovery responses had been served. The participants\u2014Bryce Koon for Kimberly Brasher and Matthew Steinberg for Walgreen Co.\u2014provided their contact details and included privilege disclosures in each message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023. Client: Kimberly Brasher. This matter concerns the claim of Kimberly Brasher against Walgreens Co. (McLean County 24-CI-00012). The exchange below reflects late-2024 counsel communications regarding discovery in the case, with Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, corresponding with Matthew B. Steinberg, Esq., Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. The electronic messages were sent with standard attorney-client privilege notices and were addressed to the named recipients, with copies to the Filevine project email for Kimberly Brasher.\n\nThe earliest dated communication in this thread occurs on November 12, 2024, when Matthew B. Steinberg wrote to Bryce Koon: \u201cThanks for the email and nice to meet you. I have just received the file and probably need a few days to figure out what is going on. Would you be okay if I got back to you first of next week. I see you have been waiting a bit and am sorry for that. I promise to work as quickly as possible.\u201d This message marked the initial acknowledgement of receipt of the file and a plan to follow up after a short period of review.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, Bryce Koon followed up with Matthew Steinberg regarding the discovery requests in the case, asking, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on the discovery requests in this one. Any update appreciated.\u201d He included his Whaley Law Firm contact details and again noted the standard privilege language in the email footer.\n\nTwo days later, on December 13, 2024, Bryce sent another message to Matthew with additional documents and access to relevant materials. He began, \u201cGood morning Matthew, Please see attached. Below is a Dropbox link to relevant documents. If you have any trouble with the link or have any questions in this regard, please let me know.\u201d He provided a Dropbox link to a PDF titled Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf and closed with thanks and his contact information, including the firm\u2019s privilege notice.\n\nThat same day, December 13, 2024, at 9:05 AM, Matthew Steinberg replied: \u201cThank you. We are working on these. I can\u2019t recall if you all have sent a demand on this one or not. If so, would you please forward as I can\u2019t locate one in the file I received.\u201d He again included his signature block with his title, office location in Lexington, and the firm\u2019s multi-state presence.\n\nEarlier in the day, December 13, 2024 at 10:13 AM, Bryce Koon sent a separate message confirming the formal delivery of documents and attaching the same Dropbox link for convenience. His message reiterated the Dropbox link and invited any questions, ending with the customary privilege notice.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, at 10:30 AM, Matthew Steinberg wrote: \u201cThank you all. I have now gone through the file. I see that Lee had discovery complete and verified just before he transferred the file to me. Did he ever serve these responses on you all?\u201d He described the prior attorney (Lee) as having completed and verified the discovery before transfer and asked whether those responses had been served on the opposing side.\n\nThe chronology continued on December 27, 2024, when Bryce Koon emailed Matthew Steinberg: \u201cGood afternoon Matthew, We have not received any discovery responses that I am aware of.\u201d This message confirmed there had been no discovery responses in hand at that time. It also contained the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard privilege disclaimer, as with prior communications.\n\nOn December 30, 2024, there were two brief exchanges. First, at 8:34 AM, Matthew Steinberg replied to Bryce: \u201cThanks. You will have those this week.\u201d He again included his office\u2019s full signature block and the multi-state firm listing. Then, at 12:33 PM, Bryce Koon responded: \u201cSounds good, thank you.\u201d This final note, like the others, carried the standard attorney-client privilege language.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondence circulated among the involved attorneys regarding discovery in Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012), with documented efforts to obtain discovery responses, reference to prior counsel\u2019s completion and verification of discovery, and ongoing coordination about delivering and serving those responses. The communications also show that the Filevine project email for Kimberly Brasher was CC\u2019d in the thread, and each email contained the customary privilege notices indicating that the messages were intended only for the named recipients and should not be forwarded if received in error. The parties\u2019 representatives\u2014W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, and Matthew B. Steinberg, Esq., Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A.\u2014exchanged these updates within the weeks leading up to December 30, 2024, with the expectation that discovery responses would be exchanged within that week.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012), counsel communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. over discovery in late 2024 and early 2025. The subject line for these exchanges consistently referenced the case, with the latest note identifying the case as Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. and listing the parties involved.\n\nThe first substantive thread began on December 12, 2024, when W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, sent a message to Matthew B. Steinberg, Co-Managing Partner of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., in Lexington, Kentucky, with Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 as a cc\u2019d recipient through the Filevine Project Email Address. The content of that initial message is not fully shown in the record, but it sets the stage for subsequent communications about discovery.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, Bryce followed up with Matthew, stating that he had attached documents and providing a Dropbox link to relevant materials for the case. He wrote: Good morning Matthew, Please see attached. Below is a Dropbox link to relevant documents. If you have any trouble with the link or have any questions in this regard, please let me know. The message included the link to Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf and carried the standard attorney-client disclaimers.\n\nLater that same day, December 13, 2024 at 9:05 a.m., Matthew replied that they were working on the materials. He asked Bryce to forward any discovery demand if one had already been sent, noting that he could not locate a demand in the file he had received. He also included his signature and firm information.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, at approximately 10:30 a.m., Matthew wrote again, thanking the recipients and reporting that he had gone through the file and observed that Lee had discovery complete and verified just before transferring the file to him. He asked whether Lee had ever served those responses on their side.\n\nA few days later, on December 27, 2024, Bryce responded that they had not received any discovery responses to his knowledge. He reiterated the lack of receipt of those materials.\n\nOn December 30, 2024, at 8:34 a.m., Matthew replied that they would have the discovery responses that week. Bryce replied later that day at 12:33 p.m. with a brief, \u201cSounds good, thank you,\u201d confirming the plan to receive the responses shortly.\n\nThe timeline continued into the new year. On January 3, 2025, at 11:30:45 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryce sent a follow-up email to counsel, stating: Good morning counsel, I may have missed an email or something, but I cannot seem to find your client\u2019s discovery responses anywhere. I see that you filed a notice of service on 12/30/24 \u2013 is there any chance you could resend those to me? If they were mailed, there is always the chance they have not arrived yet. Any update appreciated. He concluded with his standard contact information and the firm\u2019s attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications consistently referenced the discovery responses and the status of service, including the observation that a notice of service had allegedly been filed on December 30, 2024, and the concern that mailed responses may not have arrived yet. The thread includes the typical attorney disclaimers and signatures, with Koon representing The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville and Steinberg representing Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. in Lexington, as well as the cc\u2019d Filevine Project email address for Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023.\n\nIn summary, from December 2024 through early January 2025, counsel pursued the status and delivery of the client\u2019s discovery responses, noting that prior counsel had completed discovery before transferring the file, and coordinating expectations about receiving and resending those discovery materials to ensure they were properly served and received. The most recent request, dated January 3, 2025, sought a resend of the discovery responses due to difficulty locating them, alongside acknowledgment of a notice of service filed on December 30, 2024.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012), the client is Kimberly Brasher. The case file shows a sequence of discovery-related communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., concerning production of discovery responses and potential mediation. The communications span mid-December 2024 to early January 2025 and include multiple exchanges between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, and Matthew B. Steinberg, Co-Managing Partner of the Lexington office at Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A.\n\nOn December 13, 2024, at 10:13 a.m., Bryce Koon sent Matthew Steinberg an email with attached materials and a Dropbox link to relevant documents for the Brasher case. The message stated that Bryce had attached documents and provided a Dropbox link to Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf, with the link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tqrnzqyt94qf1ergchw4f/Brasher-Demand-Exhibits.pdf?rlkey=8lfk22d08o4z59ublt1q3ax6e&st=z9tiqqfc&dl=0. Bryce included his firm\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365-5043; fax (502) 237-3207. He also included the standard attorney-client confidentiality disclaimer on the message. The email was copied to Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address, with the address KimberlyBrasherSFZ3954564@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and bore the subject line referring to Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. (McLean 24-CI-00012).\n\nOn December 23, 2024, at 10:30 a.m., Matthew Steinberg replied. He thanked the recipients and indicated that he had gone through the file, noting that \u201cLee had discovery complete and verified just before he transferred the file to me.\u201d He asked whether those discovery responses had ever been served on the other side.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, at 2:15 p.m., Bryce Koon responded. He stated that, to his knowledge, they had not received any discovery responses. He again referenced the Brasher matter and was sending the update to Matthew Steinberg, with copies to the same Filevine address.\n\nOn December 30, 2024, at 8:34 a.m., Matthew Steinberg replied: \u201cThanks. You will have those this week.\u201d He again provided his firm\u2019s contact information\u2014Co-Managing Partner, Lexington Office, Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507; phone (859) 226-0057; fax (859) 226-0059; email matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com.\n\nShortly after, on December 30, 2024, at 12:33 p.m., Bryce Koon responded: \u201cSounds good, thank you.\u201d His message carried the same standard confidentiality disclaimer found in prior emails from The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThrough January 3, 2025, the email thread continued. On January 3, 2025, at 11:31 a.m., Bryce wrote to Matthew, noting that he may have missed an email and could not locate the client\u2019s discovery responses. He observed that a notice of service had been filed on December 30, 2024, and asked whether those responses could be resent, noting the possibility that mailed responses might not have arrived yet. He requested any update.\n\nAt 11:34 a.m. on January 3, 2025, Matthew responded to Bryce, saying he would check with his paralegal and suggesting they discuss the case at the next opportunity, adding that mediation might be a good idea for this matter. His signature block included the Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A. Lexington office address, phone, fax, and web information.\n\nLastly, at 11:36 a.m. on January 3, 2025, Bryce replied, \u201cSounds good. I can give you a call later this afternoon,\u201d confirming the plan for a follow-up discussion.\n\nThroughout this correspondence, the messages consistently included the standard confidentiality notices typical of each sender\u2019s firm. The exchanges document the parties\u2019 ongoing efforts to obtain and exchange discovery responses in the Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreen Co. case, including references to a service notice dated December 30, 2024, and ongoing discussions about mediation as a potential path forward.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Kimberly Brasher v. Walgreens Co., McLean County, case number 24-CI-00012, mediation scheduling was being arranged for the client, Kimberly Brasher. The involved parties included The Whaley Law Firm, representing Ms. Brasher, and Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., with correspondence between their respective teams. The mediator selected for the matter is Hon. Thomas Knopf.\n\nOn January 9, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Matthew B. Steinberg of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley. She explained that they understood the parties had decided on Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator and provided dates on which he and the client and firm were available. She asked Mr. Steinberg to review the listed dates and indicate which would work best, and she requested confirmation on whether a half day of mediation would be sufficient or if a full day would be preferred. The dates proposed for January 2025 were the 21st through the 31st, and for February 2025 they included the 3rd, 4th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th.

The email was sent with the subject line: Kimberly Brasher v Walgreens CO. - McLean Co - 24-CI-00012 - Mediation Scheduling.\n\nMatt Steinberg replied later on January 9, 2025, indicating that they could do either February 25th or February 28th for mediation. He noted that his adjuster would need to participate via Zoom because the adjuster is in California, and that he would be available to attend in person or by Zoom, whichever worked best. Steinberg signed his message with his full professional details: Co-Managing Partner, Lexington Office, Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A.; 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507; Ph: (859) 226-0057; Fax: (859) 226-0059; Email: matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com; Web: www.qpwblaw.com.

She stated: \u201cAwesome. Let\u2019s do Feb 25th 2025 via Zoom so no one has to travel. Do you prefer a full or half day? If a half day will suffice, we can do a 1:00 p.m. start time.\u201d This message reiterated the mediation logistics and confirmed the preference for a Zoom format for the February 25, 2025 date if feasible, along with the option to proceed with either a half-day starting at 1:00 p.m. or a full-day session if needed.

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly Brasher v Walgreens Co. \u2013 McLean County, 24-CI-00012 \u2013 Mediation Scheduling\n\nIn early January 2025, the matter of Kimberly Brasher v Walgreens Co. in McLean County (case number 24-CI-00012) moved into mediation scheduling with Hon. Thomas Knopf selected as the mediator. The Whaley Law Firm, representing Ms. Brasher, coordinated with Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., whose Lexington office is led by Co-Managing Partner Matthew B. Steinberg, regarding available mediation dates and whether a half-day or full-day session would be appropriate. The parties discussed conducting mediation via Zoom to minimize travel, with the adjuster required to participate remotely due to being in California.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue began on January 9, 2025, when Sarena Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, reached out to Mr. Steinberg to confirm dates that Hon. Knopf and the client could accommodate. Sarena provided January 2025 dates (21, 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31) and February 2025 dates (3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 14, 20, 21, 25, 26, 27, 28) and asked whether a half-day would suffice or if a full day was preferable.\n\nIn response on January 9, 2025 at 3:49 PM, Mr. Steinberg indicated that mediation could be held on February 25th or 28th, noting that his adjuster would need to participate via Zoom due to being in California, while he could attend in person or via Zoom.\n\nLater that day, and again on January 9, 2025 at 2:46 PM, Sarena reiterated to Mr. Steinberg that the team preferred February 25th, 2025, and suggested conducting the mediation via Zoom to avoid travel. She asked whether a full-day or half-day format was preferred and proposed a 1:00 PM start time if a half-day would be sufficient.\n\nOn January 10, 2025, Mr. Steinberg replied that a half-day would be more than sufficient. In a follow-up that same day, Sarena confirmed, \u201cAwesome. Let\u2019s do Feb 25th 2025 via Zoom so no one has to travel. Do you prefer a full or half day? If a half day will suffice, we can do a 1:00 PM start time.\u201d\n\nSarena then concluded with, \u201cSounds good. I will get everything lined out with Hon. Knopf\u2019s office. Thank you so much. Stay safe & warm.\u201d Her signature indicated her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), main line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and her new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nFor reference, Mr. Steinberg\u2019s credentials were listed as Co-Managing Partner \u2013 Lexington Office of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., located at 444 East Main Street, Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507, with Ph: (859) 226-0057 and Fax: (859) 226-0059, and email matthew.steinberg@qpwblaw.com (Web: www.qpwblaw.com). The communications also included cc\u2019d colleagues Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley from The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn sum, the parties agreed to proceed with a mediation on February 25, 2025, conducted via Zoom, with a half-day format (starting at 1:00 PM if a half-day is chosen) to accommodate the California-based adjuster, and to have Hon. Thomas Knopf oversee the mediation. The Whaley Law Firm confirmed the plan and continued to coordinate with Knopf\u2019s office.",

      "natural_language": "The case labeled Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023 concerns client Kimberly Brasher. On February 25, 2025, at 09:42:43 in the morning, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Sarena Tuttle with a CC to Sarah Ingle. The subject line read: Re: Kimberly Brasher (20240514-001078). In the email, Koon stated that they were actively attempting to resolve Ms. Brasher\u2019s claim and asked Sarena to provide a final lien amount related to Ms. Brasher\u2019s treatment. He included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer typical of attorney communications.\n\nEarlier in the timeline, on December 4, 2024 at about 12:15 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied to the prior communications. She acknowledged receipt and stated that the items would be considered related. However, she noted that there are two charges dated 03/10 and 03/12 listed as \u201cUnknown Provider\u201d for the same amount of $17,270.50. She asked for confirmation on whether these charges are duplicative or if they represent the same procedure performed twice\u2014once at the beginning and once at the end of Ms. Brasher\u2019s inpatient treatment, since Mrs. Brasher was hospitalized from 03/10 through 03/12. Sarena included her professional title as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with contact details and a note indicating the \u201cnew email address.\u201d\n\nThe prior message from December 3, 2024 at 3:43 PM came from Sarah Ingle Hobbs of The Phia Group, LLC. She wrote to Sarena that the attached claim forms contained additional provider information and asked to be notified if anything further was needed. The email was signed by Sarah Ingle Hobbs, Sr. Claim Recovery Specialist at The Phia Group, who provided the group\u2019s phone and fax numbers (both listed as 502-213-5717) and instructed that checks be mailed to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021.\n\nEarlier still, on November 27, 2024 at 9:40 AM, Sarena emailed Sarah Ingle. Sarena thanked Sarah for the update, said she would update their contact information, and expressed that she looked forward to hearing from them. The message included Sarena\u2019s contact information and signatures indicating her role as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the Louisville, KY address and phone numbers.\n\nOn November 26, 2024 at 4:10 PM, Sarah Ingle wrote that she had taken over the handling of the file. She noted that she had removed all claims marked \u201cclaim watcher LLC\u201d from their listing and had requested additional information from her claims department for claims marked Provider Unknown. She promised to forward the updated lien as soon as she received a response. This message was signed by Sarah Ingle Hobbs, Sr. Claim Recovery Specialist at The Phia Group, LLC, with the same contact details and a reminder to mail checks to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021.\n\nThroughout the email chain, several boilerplate confidentiality and privilege notices from The Phia Group appeared, underscoring that the information is intended for the addressed recipient and that any unintended receipt should be reported and deleted. The communications also carried standard statements clarifying that the Phia Group is not a law firm and that the information provided is informational and not a substitute for legal counsel. Additionally, there were multiple reiterations of similar confidentiality and privilege notices in the footer blocks of the messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly Brasher (Premise 2-25-2023). Client: Kimberly Brasher. This case concerns the claim identified as 20240514-001078 and involves The Phia Group, LLC, The Whaley Law Firm, and Ms. Brasher.\n\nIn late November 2024, The Phia Group\u2019s Sarah Ingle took over the handling of Ms. Brasher\u2019s file. On November 26, 2024, she advised that she had removed all claims marked \u201cclaim watcher LLC\u201d from the listing and had requested additional information from the claims department for claims marked \u201cProvider Unknown.\u201d She stated that, as soon as she received a response, she would forward an updated lien. On November 27, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, thanking Sarah for the update and saying she would update their contact information and look forward to further communication.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, Sarah Ingle sent the claim forms with additional provider information to Sarena Tuttle and indicated that she could provide anything else needed. She also included a note to mail all checks to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021. Sarena\u2019s reply on December 4, 2024 acknowledged receipt and stated that the information would be treated as related. However, she noted two charges dated March 10 and March 12 from an \u201cUnknown Provider\u201d for the same amount of $17,270.50. She asked whether these charges were duplicative or whether the same procedure had been performed twice\u2014once at the beginning and again at the end of Ms. Brasher\u2019s inpatient hospitalization from March 10 through March 12. Sarena signed with her updated contact information, noting a new email address.\n\nThroughout this period, standard confidentiality and privilege notices accompanied the communications. The emails and their attachments contained numerous disclaimers indicating that the information was confidential, intended only for the named recipient, not a substitute for legal advice, and not creating an attorney-client relationship unless expressly stated.\n\nMoving forward to early 2025, on February 25, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Sarena Tuttle (with Sarah Ingle copied) stating that they were actively trying to resolve Ms. Brasher\u2019s claim and requesting a final lien amount related to Ms. Brasher\u2019s treatment. Bryce provided his contact details and asked for the final lien amount.\n\nOn February 27, 2025, Cheyenne Lopes, a Sr. Contested Liability Specialist at The Phia Group, sent an updated listing of claims paid on behalf of the plan participant for which the Plan seeks reimbursement. She asked for notification if there were any other claims not included on the list and stated that, as long as Ms. Brasher is no longer treating, there would be no missing claims and everything should match the client\u2019s records, allowing the matter to be treated as final. She also instructed that any outstanding balances should be rectified directly with the providers. The message included Cheyenne\u2019s direct line and email, and represented that this could finalize the matter if there were no further discrepancies. Sarah Ingle subsequently forwarded this message in a reply to Cheyenne, continuing the discussion regarding the final lien and related claims.\n\nIn sum, the case progressed through late 2024 with internal reviews of claims lists, removal of certain claims, and questions about two duplicate/unknown-provider charges totaling $17,270.50 tied to the inpatient hospitalization period. By February 27, 2025, the parties were working toward a final lien amount and a final accounting of paid claims, with the understanding that the matter could be treated as final if no additional claims were missing and all records matched, provided outstanding balances were resolved with providers.",

      "natural_language": "In the Brasher v. Walgreens matter (McLean 24-CI-00012), pertaining to client Kimberly Brasher, a sequence of email correspondences took place in early July 2025 concerning discovery and a corporate representative deposition. The top message in the thread, dated July 3, 2025 at 11:28:44 a.m. Eastern Time, was from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, addressed to Matthew B. Steinberg, Esq., with copies to Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address, Steven P. Stadler, Inga A. Fonov, and others. In this email, counsel thanked the recipient for the follow-up and stated that the discovery responses would be provided in the coming days. Regarding the Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, Koon outlined that the topics would address control and maintenance of the property after closure, any inspections or upkeep performed, the presence or absence of signage or warnings, and Walgreens\u2019 general policies for closed locations. The email also indicated that the parties would cover whether any steps were taken to evaluate or document the condition of the premises before or after the incident. Koon acknowledged the opposing position but argued that these topics are appropriate for corporate testimony under the circumstances. He offered to share the finalized topic list and to discuss any concerns before proceeding with notice of the deposition. The email closed with Koon\u2019s signature, including his title, The Whaley Law Firm, and contact details (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207), followed by a standard privilege disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and warning against disclosure if received in error; a note about no waiver of privilege, and instructions not to forward the information to unintended recipients. An image note stating \u201cImage removed by sender\u201d appeared in the message.\n\nEarlier that same day, July 1, 2025, at 11:05 a.m., Bryce Koon had sent another email in the same thread to Matthew B. Steinberg with Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address copied on the distribution list. In that message, Koon asked for potential dates in August to depose the corporate representative, stating that he would follow up with a notice and a list of topics once dates were proposed. He invited any questions in this regard and again signed with his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThat evening, at 4:31 p.m. on July 1, 2025, Matthew B. Steinberg replied to Bryce Koon. Steinberg noted that he had sent several emails to Aaron that had gone unanswered. He recounted that he had asked in April whether the parties would be open to negotiating an agreed scheduling order governing discovery, experts, motions, pretrial matters, and trial dates, and that he had sent a second request on June 12 seeking responses to discovery served in September. Steinberg stated that he did not see those responses and asked that they be produced within the next seven days. Regarding the proposed corporate representative deposition, he indicated that the topics would need to be appropriate for such a deposition given that Walgreens\u2019 store was closed at the time the client fell in the vacant parking lot; depending on the topics, the matter might require discussion with the Court. He expressed willingness to discuss the matter over a call. He concluded by noting that if the parties preferred not to enter into a scheduling order, he would proceed with filing a Motion for a Status Conference with the Court to obtain dates on the calendar. The message closed with his signature block, listing his title as Co-Managing Partner \u2013 Lexington Office, Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., along with the firm\u2019s Lexington address (444 East Main Street Suite 201, Lexington, KY 40507), phone, fax, and web address, and a broad list of jurisdictions where the firm operates. The message also included the firm\u2019s standard client-support note and the same attorney-client privilege disclaimer that preceded the earlier communications.\n\nIn sum, the parties were coordinating discovery and a potential corporate deposition in the Brasher v. Walgreens case, with Koon proposing August deposition dates and outlining a 30(b)(6) topic list focused on post-closure property control and maintenance, inspections, signage or warnings, and Walgreens\u2019 policies for closed locations, while Steinberg pressed for production of outstanding discovery responses and signaled possible Court involvement if scheduling could not be agreed. The exchange also reflected ongoing concerns about whether a corporate representative deposition would be appropriate given Walgreens\u2019 store status at the time of the incident, and it included the customary disclaimers and contact details typical of the parties\u2019 communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023\nClient: Kimberly Brasher\n\nRe: Brasher v. Walgreens (McLean 24-CI-00012)\n\nOn July 1, 2025, at approximately 11:05 AM, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm emailed Matthew B. Steinberg of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., regarding Brasher v. Walgreens (McLean 24-CI-00012). In the message, Bryce stated that counsel would like to take the deposition of the corporate representative and asked Matthew to provide potential dates in August, promising to respond with a notice and a list of topics. The message was sent to Matthew with Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address in the cc line, along with Steven P. Stadler and Inga A. Fonov. The email included Bryce\u2019s phone number and firm address, and ended with the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be forwarded; if received in error, recipients were instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and to preserve privilege.\n\nLater on July 1, 2025, at about 4:32 PM, Matthew B. Steinberg replied to Bryce. He acknowledged the need to submit to the Court an Agreed Scheduling Order and indicated that he was attaching a draft scheduling order, expressing willingness to adjust any dates as needed. He asked Bryce to advise of any changes or whether he had Bryce\u2019s permission to file the order with the Court and sign Bryce\u2019s name on it. Matthew\u2019s signature block followed, including his title as Co-Managing Partner of the Lexington Office of Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., and his contact information. The message also carried the standard advisory about the firm\u2019s commitment to client service.\n\nOn July 25, 2025, at 2:51 PM, Matthew B. Steinberg sent another message to Bryce, with Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address, Steven P. Stadler, and Inga A. Fonov in copy. He attached a draft Agreed Scheduling Order and invited Bryce to advise of any changes. The email included Matthew\u2019s firm signature block and the firm\u2019s boilerplate about client experience and availability of client support.\n\nFinally, on July 29, 2025, at 10:27 AM, Bryce Koon responded to Matthew. Bryce stated that he was agreeable to the structure of the agreed order but requested that the dates be moved back by 30 days. He indicated that if those changes were acceptable, Matthew had his permission to file the order; if not, Bryce asked to be informed. The message concluded with Bryce\u2019s signature, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information, and the same standard confidentiality disclaimer as the prior messages, noting that the email is intended for the named recipient and should not be used or forwarded to others if received in error.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Brasher v. Walgreens (McLean 24-CI-00012), the case caption shows Case: Kimberly-Brasher-Premise-2-25-2023 with client Kimberly Brasher. The record reflects a sequence of email communications between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Matthew B. Steinberg, Co-Managing Partner at Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer, P.A., concerning scheduling and discovery in the Brasher v. Walgreens matter. The communication was dated July 29, 2025, 03:59:50 GMT-04:00, and included a line from the client: \u201cThat is fine thank you.\u201d The note also lists the sending and receiving parties, with Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information and firm address, and the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of the firm\u2019s electronic communications. CC\u2019d on the exchanges were Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address, Steven P. Stadler, and Inga A. Fonov, among others.\n\nThe first substantive exchange within the thread occurs on July 1, 2025, when Bryce Koon writes to Matt Steinberg asking, \u201cCounsel, We would like to take the deposition of your corporate representative. Please provide me with potential dates in August and I will get back to you with a notice and list of topics. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.\u201d This message is followed by Bryce\u2019s closing and his firm\u2019s signature block.\n\nEarlier that same day, July 1, 2025 at 4:32 PM, Matt Steinberg replies to Bryce, with copies to the same recipients, explaining that they are required to submit to the Court an Agreed Scheduling Order and asking for any changes or authorization to file the attached draft with the Court and sign on the other party\u2019s behalf. He notes his willingness to adjust dates as needed and asks for confirmation to proceed.\n\nIn a prior July 1, 2025 message (11:05 AM), Bryce had requested potential August deposition dates for the corporate representative and invited Matt to propose topics. The thread shows continued coordination on whether to pursue a corporate representative deposition and how that would fit with the case\u2019s circumstances, including the store being closed at the time the client fell in the vacant parking lot.\n\nOn July 25, 2025, at 2:51 PM, Matt Steinberg sent another message to Bryce with a draft Agreed Scheduling Order and invited any changes. The email was again cc\u2019d to Kimberly Brasher Premise 2/25/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address, Steven P. Stadler, and Inga A. Fonov, and included Matt\u2019s firm signature and standard firm contact information. He signaled that he was sending the draft for review and alignment on discovery, experts, motions, pretrials, and trial dates.\n\nSubsequently, on July 29, 2025, at 7:56 AM, Matt Steinberg sent a follow-up email reiterating the draft Agreed Scheduling Order and asking for any changes. At 3:34 PM the same day, Matt sent another message beginning with, \u201cHow does this work?\u201d and stated that he was following up on the attached scheduling order draft, offering to adjust any dates, and requesting permission to file the document with the Court and sign the other party\u2019s name if there were no changes. He again included his professional signature and firm information. The thread also preserves the broader firm boilerplate and client-support language, emphasizing the firm\u2019s commitment to client service, and reiterates the confidentiality notice common to electronic communications.\n\nThe chain\u2019s closing reflects the ongoing process: Bryce had solicited August deposition dates for a corporate representative and topics; Matt had proposed an Agreed Scheduling Order and offered to file it with the Court if the other side agreed or consented to signing on their behalf; and the parties remained engaged in discussions about discovery responses (noting that Matt had emailed Aaron with no response) and about whether a corporate representative deposition was appropriate given the store\u2019s closure at the time of the incident, potentially requiring Court involvement. The record captures multiple drafts and correspondence aimed at establishing a scheduling order and moving the case forward through discovery, experts, motions, pretrials, and trial planning.",
