The Front Desk signaled that these were attached as part of the response.\n\nSeparately, on September 12, 2024 at 11:01 AM, Jessa Galosmo forwarded the entire thread, including the above exchanges, to Greg Whaley.\n\nIn the forwarded content, the thread shows the initial request for medical records (dated September 11, 2024) and the subsequent communication indicating the need for a different format for treatment notes (due to an inability to open a PRNX file) as well as the PDF attachment noted by the Front Desk on September 12, 2024.\n\nThe emails also included the Whaley Law Firm signature for Jessa Galosmo, with the same phone and fax numbers, and the Aiken Family Dentistry signature block with the practice\u2019s address and contact details, reinforcing the exchange between Whaley Law Firm and the dental provider.\n\nOverall, the record shows a coordinated effort in September 2024 to obtain James Sadler\u2019s dental and medical records dating back at least ten years, including a request for older treatment notes in an accessible format, a substantial set of attached dental records and images from Aiken Family Dentistry, and a subsequent forwarding of the full correspondence to a member of the Whaley firm.",

They had previously offered $5,500 without dental records and bills, and their offer rose to $7,688 once those records and bills were provided.

A settlement statement has been prepared based on this $7,688 figure, but they have not yet obtained the potential Delta Dental lien for the dentist\u2019s payments.

      "natural_language": "The case is James-Sadler-MVA-4-07-2023, with client James Sadler. On January 7, 2025, at 1:59 PM, a new voice message from James Sadler was recorded (the caller listed as 502-417-5186) and routed to Aaron Whaley. The note documenting this message is part of an email thread that includes communications among Aaron Whaley, Bryce Koon, and the James Sadler MVA file. The message indicates that Sadler is in Louisville and had a wreck almost 22 months prior; he believes Whaley is handling a case for him but says he has not heard back and asks what he should do next. The voicemail preview states: \u201cHey, Mr. Whaley, this is James Sadler. I am in Louisville and I had a wreck almost 22 months ago and I think you are working on a case for me, but I have not heard anything from Nobody answers my call, so thought to touch base with you and see, what do you think I should do 502-417-5186.\u201d The message was received at 1:59 PM on Tuesday, January 7, 2025, and can be listened to via RingCentral or the main account with the provided extension and password.\n\nIn the surrounding email thread, Bryce Koon responds at 3:14 PM the same day, noting that this is \u201cactually one on my list to talk to you about.\u201d He explains that the opposing party\u2019s top offer is $7,688, and it is unclear why they are sticking at this amount. The opposing party initially offered $5,500 without dental records and bills, and increased to $7,688 once those records and bills were obtained. Bryce states he countered at $35,000, but they have remained at $7,688. He mentions that he prepared a settlement statement based on the $7,688 figure, but they have not yet received the potential lien from Delta Dental for the dentist\u2019s payments. He notes that he believes the claim may be worth more than the current offer, though he is not certain how much more, particularly with the dental-related items. Bryce asks for Aaron\u2019s thoughts before he speaks with Sadler and asks which direction Aaron thinks they should steer the client\u2014litigation or settlement.\n\nEarlier, at 2:59 PM, Aaron Whaley replies with a brief, \u201cPlease call.\u201d The message then includes a forwarded RingCentral notice, dated the same day, announcing the new voice message from James Sadler (502) 417-5186. The RingCentral notification indicates the message was received on Tuesday, January 7, 2025, at 1:59 PM, with a duration of 28 seconds, and directed to the number ending in 4022 for Aaron Whaley. The voicemail preview is quoted as: \u201cHey, Mr. Whaley, this is James Sadler. I am in Louisville and I had a wreck almost 22 months ago and I think you are working on a case for me, but I have not heard anything from Nobody answers my call, so thought to touch base with you and see, what do you think I should do 502-417-5186.\u201d The notification advises listening to the message on the phone or logging into RingCentral to manage voicemails, reinforcing that Sadler is seeking guidance on the status of his case.",

There is also uncertainty about the full extent of the dental injuries and their impact on the value of the case.\n\nNext steps should include following up on the dental lien from Delta Dental, maintaining regular communication with the client, and preparing for litigation proceedings.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Sadler v. Tafesse, the case James-Sadler-MVA-4-07-2023 lists James Sadler as the client. The correspondence shown is an email chain between counsel regarding discovery requests, with the subject line Re: Sadler v. Tafesse. The June 3, 2025 communication came from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Allison L. Rief, Attorney at Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, with Jennifer Styles and the James Sadler MVA 4/07/2023 Filevine project address copied on the message. The June 3, 2025 email, dated 11:44:39 a.m. Eastern Time, includes the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s physical address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and contact numbers: phone 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. It also repeats the standard confidentiality disclaimer stating the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information, with instructions to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error and a warning not to disclose or forward the information.\n\nThe June 3 message followed an April 11, 2025 exchange in which Allison L. Rief, an attorney with Dilbeck and Myers, indicated she had met with Mr. Tafesse that morning to answer discovery requests and requested that the sending party provide a Word document copy of their requests so she could draft them. Bryce Koon replied later that day, at about 12:16 p.m., stating, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Please see attached. Thank you,\u201d and signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information. The email was sent to Allison Rief and cc\u2019d to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Jennifer Styles (jennifer@dilbeckandmyers.com), and the James Sadler MVA 4/07/2023 Filevine project address JamesSadlerMVAZ3759369@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 12:14 p.m., Allison Rief had written to Bryce Koon asking if they could provide a Word document copy of the requests so she could draft responses. Bryce\u2019s 12:16 p.m. reply indicated that attachments would be sent, and he again included the same parties in the CC field. Allison\u2019s response around 12:18 p.m. that day was, \u201cAppreciated \u2013 thank you,\u201d followed by her professional signature with the Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC contact details and a confidentiality notice similar to the one included in the later messages. Allison\u2019s signature lists the Dilbeck and Myers address as 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with telephone 502.595.6500 and fax 502.595.6504.\n\nIn summary, the record shows ongoing discovery communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck and Myers related to the Sadler v. Tafesse case, including requests for Word-document copies of discovery requests, a meeting with Mr. Tafesse to discuss those requests, and subsequent collaborative follow-up emails on April 11, 2025, culminating in Bryce Koon\u2019s follow-up on June 3, 2025, requesting status on the outstanding requests. The correspondence consistently includes the case reference, relevant participants, and standard confidentiality disclosures typical of attorney communications.",

Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel Allison L. Rief, Esq., of Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC. The message, titled \u201cRe: Sadler v.

It asked for guidance on when the parties may expect responses to outstanding discovery requests. The email included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and a standard attorney\u2011client privilege notice stating that the communication is intended only for the named recipient, with instructions to contact the firm if it was received in error and not to disclose or forward the contents.\n\nEarlier, on June 3, 2025 at approximately 11:44 a.m., Bryce Koon sent a follow-up to counsel: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on these requests.\u201d The message again included the firm\u2019s contact details and the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe record also shows an extensive April 11, 2025 thread. At 12:14 p.m., Allison Rief wrote that she had met with Mr. Tafesse that morning to answer discovery requests and requested that the opposing side send a Word document copy of their requests so she could draft them. At 12:16 p.m., Bryce Koon replied, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Please see attached,\u201d followed by The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and the usual privilege disclaimer. At 12:18 p.m., Allison responded, \u201cAppreciated \u2013 thank you.\u201d Earlier in that same correspondence, Bryce had sent documents as attachments, and the thread again carried the standard attorney\u2011client privilege notices. The communications throughout this period involved the parties coordinating the discovery requests and drafts, with the Filevine project email address listed in the June 11 message and the Whaley and Dilbeck agencies repeatedly documenting their standard confidentiality warnings.",

      "natural_language": "This case note pertains to James Sadler in the matter captioned Sadler v. Tafesse (an April 7, 2023 motor vehicle accident), with the client identified as James Sadler. The document lines up a sequence of written discovery activities and deposition scheduling communications between counsel, culminating in a request for deposition dates for Mr. Tafesse and an invitation to revisit informal negotiations before further depositions.\n\nOn June 20, 2025, at 11:25:48 AM Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Allison Rief, attorney for the defense at Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC. He noted that written discovery appeared to be complete and asked for potential dates for Mr. Tafesse\u2019s deposition at the earliest convenience. He also indicated that Mr. Sadler is widely available over the next two months if the defense wished to coordinate his deposition as well. Koon asked to be advised whether the parties would like to revisit informal negotiations before committing additional time and resources to depositions. He provided his firm\u2019s contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone 502-365-5043; Fax 502-237-3207.\n\nEarlier communications in the chain reflect ongoing discovery-related activity. On June 16, 2025, at 4:28 PM (noted as \u201c4:28?PM\u201d in the record), Allison L. Rief, attorney for Dilbeck and Myers, reported that a storm on Friday had delayed Mr. Tafesse, but he was able to come by the office that day to verify his discovery responses, which were attached to the message. Rief\u2019s notice included firm contact details: Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone 502-595-6500; Fax 502-595-6504. The message also included standard confidentiality language.\n\nOn June 13, 2025, at 11:04 AM, Allison Rief had previously indicated that Mr. Tafesse would be coming in that afternoon to verify discovery, with the expectation that she would be able to forward the verified discovery soon afterwards. Her contact details and the firm\u2019s information were included in that email as well.\n\nOn June 11, 2025, at 11:29 AM, Bryce Koon asked Allison Rief to advise when the parties might expect responses to outstanding discovery requests.\n\nOn June 3, 2025, at 11:44 AM, Bryce Koon followed up again, requesting an update on the discovery requests.\n\nEarlier in the year, on April 11, 2025, there was a sequence concerning the drafting of discovery requests. Allison Rief wrote at 12:14 PM to indicate she had met with Mr. Tafesse that morning to answer discovery requests and requested that the opposing side send a Word document copy of their requests so she could draft responses. Bryce Koon replied at 12:16 PM, stating, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, please see attached.\u201d The message also noted that it had been cc\u2019d to relevant recipients and included the dedicated Filevine project address for the Sadler MVA file. At 12:18 PM, Allison Rief replied, \u201cAppreciated \u2013 thank you.\u201d\n\nAlso on April 11, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a message at 12:16 PM stating, \u201cPlease see attached,\u201d in reference to the discovery requests. This was followed by Allison\u2019s 12:18 PM reply expressing appreciation.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a coordinated effort across multiple weeks to complete discovery, verify discovery responses (including handling weather-related delays), and schedule depositions, with a current emphasis on identifying deposition dates for Mr. Tafesse and coordinating Mr. Sadler\u2019s deposition within the next two months, while remaining open to informal settlement discussions before expending additional resources on depositions. The communications identify two law firms (The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC), their respective representatives (Bryce Koon and Allison Rief), as well as the involved parties and project contact points (including the James Sadler MVA Filevine project address).",

      "natural_language": "Case: James-Sadler-MVA-4-07-2023. The client is James Sadler.\n\nBetween April and July 2025, counsel communications unfolded in the James Sadler v. Tafesse matter. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s W. Bryce Koon, Esq., wrote to Allison L. Rief, Attorney at Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, with copies to Brooke Gallagher and the James Sadler MVA Filevine project email address (JamesSadlerMVAZ3759369@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The initial excerpt in the record shows a July 23, 2025 message in which Koon followed up with counsel, requesting any update on the matter and signing off with his firm\u2019s contact information and a standard confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on June 20, 2025, Allison Rief responded to a request to coordinate Mr. Sadler\u2019s deposition, indicating she would confer with Mr. Tafesse and review calendars to find a workable time and would get back to the sender. In the same exchange, Bryce Koon replied (in a message dated June 20, 2025 at 11:26 AM) noting that, with written discovery apparently complete, they should provide potential deposition dates for Mr. Tafesse as soon as possible. He added that Mr. Sadler was widely available over the next two months if their calendars could accommodate coordinating his deposition as well, and he asked whether the parties would like to revisit informal negotiations before investing more time and resources in depositions. The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number as 502-365-5043 and fax as 502-237-3207, and it included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nOn June 16, 2025, Allison Rief wrote that Mr. Tafesse was delayed by a Friday storm but had been by the office that day to verify his discovery responses; she attached the verification (discovery responses). Her signature block identified Dilbeck and Myers, PLLC, at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222, with a telephone number of 502.595.6500 and fax 502.595.6504, and she included the customary confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier still, on June 13, 2025, Allison Rief had told Bryce that Tafesse would come in that afternoon to verify his discovery, and she expected to be able to send the verified discovery shortly thereafter. This message also carried the Dilbeck and Myers contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nA prior thread shows Bryce Koon\u2019s June 11, 2025 email to Allison Rief (and others, with the James Sadler MVA Filevine address copied) asking when the parties might expect responses to their outstanding discovery requests. The June 11 message was followed by a June 3, 2025 note from Bryce asking counsel to advise when they may expect responses to the outstanding discovery requests, again with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and confidentiality notices.\n\nThere is an earlier exchange dated April 11, 2025 in the chain, in which Allison Rief replied with \u201c Appreciated \u2013 thank you\u201d and Bryce Koon had sent a message to Allison earlier that day (12:16 PM) with copies to the Whaley firm and others; the details of that April 11 thread are partially captured in the record, confirming ongoing discovery-related communications before the June routine.\n\nIn sum, the record shows a coordinated effort from April through June 2025 to obtain and verify discovery materials, schedule and conduct depositions, and align the calendar for Mr. Tafesse\u2019s deposition while also coordinating Mr. Sadler\u2019s availability for deposition over the ensuing two-month window. The communications repeatedly reference written discovery as the trigger for moving toward depositions, the storm-related delay in Tafesse\u2019s appearance, and the plan to revisit any informal negotiations if desired before expending further resources on depositions. The communications repeatedly carry the parties\u2019 standard confidentiality notices and reference the same filevine project address for James Sadler\u2019s MVA matter, along with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s and Dilbeck & Myers\u2019 contact information.",
