During the call, Mr. Ruhl stated that he previously had an attorney and currently possesses his case file. The prior attorney told him it was a good case, but he does not have staff beyond the attorney and his wife (who is also an attorney), nor does he have funding to continue with the case expenses.\n\nMr. Ruhl described an incident that occurred on September 14, 2023, in the parking lot of his apartment complex, where he was physically assaulted by a delivery truck driver. The driver, employed by Enterprise and delivering on behalf of Menards, blocked Mr. Ruhl’s vehicle and refused to move it. After Mr. Ruhl asked the driver to relocate, the driver called him a racial slur and an insult, then struck Mr. Ruhl’s parked vehicle. Mr. Ruhl asked the driver for a business card; in response, the driver, apparently aggravated, exited the truck and punched him in the face. There was also another person in the truck, a passenger—an older Black man—who got out, approached Mr. Ruhl, punched him, and slammed his head to the ground, an act witnessed by Mr. Ruhl’s girlfriend. As a result, Mr. Ruhl sustained head lacerations and back pain. He stated that he has a PR. He also went to the hospital after the incident and noted that he is a smaller, disabled person.\n\nIntake documents were sent via VineSign.\n\nPerson Making Contact: Justin\nDate & Time: July 22, 2024",

In that message, she stated that they had received an online notification that the Certified Medical Records & Billing Request had been completed, but the downloaded documents did not fulfill the request. Specifically, they had requested Dates of Service from 09/14/2022 through 07/29/2024, but only Dates of Service in 2024 were received; the records did note prior visits in 2023 which were not included. They also had requested Certified Billing, but no billing was provided. She asked HealthMark Group to contact their office to discuss the matter in further detail and noted that they had attached the original request and the provided documents for reference. She also mentioned that they had sent these notes on August 9, 2024 and had been advised that the records and billing would be processed to include any and all visits, including those in 2023. To date, they stated, the complete records and/or billing had not been received, and if there was no billing, a certification page should be sent stating that no billing was available. The message concluded with Sarena’s contact details and a reminder of the new email address.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, Sarena also forwarded the same information in an initial message dated August 9, 2024 at 9:28 AM, reiterating that they had received a notification that the Certified Medical Records & Billing Request had been completed but the request was not fulfilled in full: the Dates of Service requested (09/14/2022 through 07/29/2024) were not fully provided, with 2023 visits missing and no Certified Billing provided. She again requested that HealthMark Group contact their office to discuss the matter and attached the original request and documents for reference. This message likewise included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and noted the firm’s intent to address the matter promptly, including the new email address for Sarena.\n\nOn the same day, HealthMark Group replied to the August 9, 2024 outreach. In a message dated August 9, 2024 (around 3:28 PM), HealthMark Group stated that they had submitted Request ID 13380236 for the reprocessing of the medical records indicated in the email. Regarding Billing, their processor indicated that there are currently no billing records available in the patient’s chart, and they requested that the firm allow some time for reprocessing of the medical records.

      "natural_language": "Timothy Ruhl’s case, filed as Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023, centers on Request 13380236 for certified medical records and billing. The client is Timothy Ruhl. Communications regarding this request were exchanged between HealthMark Group and The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager.\n\nOn August 9, 2024, at 9:28 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent an email to HealthMark Group (HealthMark Group) reporting that their Certified Medical Records & Billing Request had been completed online, but the download did not fulfill the request. She stated that the dates of service requested were 09/14/2022 through 07/29/2024, yet only dates of service in 2024 were received. The provided records did not include prior visits in 2023, and certified billing was not provided. She asked HealthMark to contact their office to discuss the matter in further detail and noted that she had attached the original request and the provided documents for reference. Her message included her contact information and reminded that this is The Whaley Law Firm’s new email address for correspondence.\n\nLater that day, at approximately 3:28 PM, HealthMark Group replied via Cortney Wyatt, stating that they had submitted the request ID 13380236 for reprocessing of the medical records indicated in the email. They noted that, according to the processor, there were currently no billing records available in the patient’s chart and asked for patience while the medical records were reprocessed.\n\nEarlier correspondence from Sarena on August 9, 2024 had reiterated the same concerns: the notification indicated the records and billing had been processed, but the actual delivery was incomplete. She again requested dates of service 09/14/2022 through 07/29/2024, highlighted that only 2024 dates were received, and pointed out that prior visits in 2023 were not included. She reaffirmed that certified billing was not provided and requested contact to discuss the matter further. She attached the original request and the documents for reference and again provided her contact details, including her note that the email address to reach her had changed to Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nFollowing these exchanges, on October 1, 2024 at 10:31 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded to HealthMark Group. She reported that they had received an online notification stating that their Certified Medical Records & Billing Request had been completed; however, upon downloading the available documents, the request remained incomplete. She specified that the Dates of Service requested were 09/14/2022 through 07/29/2024, but only 2024 dates appeared in the records. The records did note prior visits in 2023, which were not included, and Certified Billing was still not provided. She requested a discussion with HealthMark to resolve the matter and stated that they had attached the original request and the provided documents for reference. She also noted that they had sent similar notes on August 9, 2024, and were advised that the records and billing would be processed to include all visits, including those in 2023, but to date they had not received the complete records and/or billing. She added that if there is no billing, the certification page should be sent stating no billing is available.

      "natural_language": "Timothy Ruhl is the client associated with the Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023 case. On February 4, 2025, a new voice message from a wireless caller with the number (901) 376-5489 was received and was forwarded within The Whaley Law Firm’s communications thread. The forwarding originated from Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, who asked, “Does this sound like something we can help with?” The forward was sent on February 4, 2025 at 12:51:58 PM, and the message was addressed to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley.\n\nSarena Tuttle’s signature line appears in the forwarding email, providing her contact details: direct line 502-357-9971, office line 502-583-4022 ext 104, email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and a note in all caps indicating this is a new email address. The physical firm address listed is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.\n\nThe content being forwarded includes a RingCentral message header indicating a new voice message from WIRELESS CALLER (901) 376-5489, received on Tuesday, February 04, 2025 at 12:32 PM, with a length of 00:41, and intended for the number 502-583-4022 ext 104 (Sarena Tuttle). The message header is accompanied by the RingCentral interface elements and the note to listen to the message via phone or by logging into the RingCentral account to manage voicemails.\n\nThe voicemail itself is summarized in the voicemail preview: “Hey, Sarena, is Tim. I am sorry to keep bothering you. However, this is an unrelated matter. Somebody at Moen's work might need an attorney. Apparently the guy's mom was in the hospital. I guess they were trying to help her up, help her out. Whatever they broke her other hip, which she her other hip was broken and now they broke her other hip on top of that. Apparently, her wedding band came up missing and so did her false teeth. Why, somebody wants those? I do not know, but if you call me back, you got my number. Hun, thanks for.” The caller advises that the matter is unrelated to Tim and indicates there may be an attorney need related to someone at Moen’s work whose mother is in the hospital; the caller references multiple hip injuries, the missing wedding band, and missing false teeth, and ends by saying to call back and that the caller has provided a number, ending with “Hun, thanks for.” In addition to the voicemail content, the message notes that listeners can hear the message by logging into RingCentral with the main number, extension, and password, and that voicemails can be managed within the RingCentral account.",

      "natural_language": "In February 2025, the Whispering Oaks project involving Timothy Ruhl progressed through a series of updates between The Whaley Law Firm and Flagship Communities REIT. The note begins with Jody B. Gabel, Flagship’s General Counsel, outlining a plan on February 11, 2025: the home was to be set on the lot the next day, with an email update to follow on Thursday. She noted that her team would provide further information as the situation evolved.\n\nOn February 13, 2025, Gabel reported that home setters were putting the doublewide together, joining the two sections of the structure. The setters would return the following day to finish up any loose ends. The team was waiting on an update for the water and sewer connection, and the Regional Manager had advised that the clients were on site observing the work in progress. Gabel indicated she would provide an update if there was any new information on the water/sewer and electric connections the next day.\n\nAlso on February 13, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, noting she doesn’t often receive email from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, and asking for any updates that could be passed along. She and Jody had discussed keeping Tim and Maureen informed about progress.\n\nA subsequent message from Jody on February 14 confirmed the planned sequence of work: the home setters were at the site that day, joining the two sections of the doublewide, with the setters scheduled to return the next day to finish up remaining tasks. Electric hookup was scheduled for Monday, and water/sewer hookup for Tuesday. The Regional Manager was also to meet with the company constructing the deck on Wednesday to review the plans. Gabel cautioned that the schedule was subject to an incoming weather pattern predicting several inches of rain, and she emphasized that the team remained committed to moving forward with the setup. She promised to provide an update on Thursday, depending on how the weather affected progress.\n\nOn February 18, 2025, Jody Gabel sent the latest update. She stated that the home was set and the siding was completed. Water and sewer were scheduled for hookup that day, but she had not yet received confirmation. She noted that there might be a delay due to weather conditions and that the ETA for electric hookup was also being impacted by the weather. She added that as soon as any update was available, she would pass it along.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the case remained focused on the Whispering Oaks – Ruhl Home Purchase for Timothy Ruhl, with Jody Gabel representing Flagship Communities REIT and Sarena Tuttle handling communications on behalf of The Whaley Law Firm.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023\nClient: Timothy Ruhl\n\nRe: Whispering Oaks - Ruhl Home Purchase\n\nIn February 2025, communications concerning the Whispering Oaks - Ruhl Home Purchase were exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and Flagship Communities REIT regarding client Timothy Ruhl. The messages also reference Tim and Maureen in connection with the purchase and development of the home, and they include standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of corporate email correspondence.\n\nThe first set of messages began on February 11, 2025. At 2:56 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Jody B. Gabel of Flagship Communities REIT to thank her for clarifying the current status of the situation. Sarena noted that it had been a pleasure speaking with Jody and that she and her clients, Tim and Maureen, appreciated the update and stress relief the clarification provided. The email included Sarena’s contact information and a note that her email address is sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, along with the firm’s mailing address and phone numbers.\n\nJody responded later that same day, February 11, 2025, at 2:02 PM. She thanked Sarena for returning the call and explained that the plan was to have the home set on the lot the following day. She stated she would provide an email update on Thursday with the status and urged Sarena to contact her cell or email if there were additional questions.\n\nA further reply from Sarena arrived on February 13, 2025, at 1:42 PM. Her message began with a brief note that “You don’t often get email from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com,” and then she asked Jody for any updates that could be passed along.\n\nThat same day, February 13, 2025, at 2:15 PM, Jody sent another update. He explained that, according to the Regional Manager, the home setters were placing the home together by joining the two sections of the doublewide that day. The setters were expected to return the next day to finish any loose ends. They were waiting on an update for water and sewer connections, and the Regional Manager had observed the clients on site and viewing the progress. Jody also noted that the Regional Manager would provide any new information on water/sewer and electric connections the following day.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, at 3:23 PM, Jody followed up again. He reported that, after checking with the Regional Manager, the home setters were on site finishing the process of assembling the home—specifically joining the two sections of the doublewide. He stated that electric hookup was scheduled for Monday and water/sewer hookup was scheduled for Tuesday. The Regional Manager was also set to meet with the company responsible for constructing the deck on Wednesday to review the plans. Jody added that the schedule was subject to an incoming weather pattern, including the prediction of several inches of rain, and that the team remained committed to moving forward with the setup. He promised to provide an update on Monday to reflect how the weather over the weekend affected the plan.\n\nThe most recent communications occurred on February 18, 2025. At approximately 1:45 PM, Jody informed Sarena that the home was set and the siding had been completed. He stated that water and sewer hookups were scheduled for that day but that he had not yet received confirmation, and there could be a delay due to weather conditions. He also indicated that the ETA for electric hookup had been impacted by the weather, and that he would pass along any updates as they became available.\n\nIn the late afternoon of February 18, 2025, at 1:56 PM (13:56:27 -0500), Sarena replied with appreciation for the update and good wishes. She noted the recent severe flooding in the area around the Park over the weekend and expressed hope that the park itself had not been badly affected. She indicated that they looked forward to further updates as the situation progressed.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the messages from Flagship Communities REIT repeatedly included standard confidentiality and privilege notices, stating that the communication was intended only for the addressees, that the information may be privileged or confidential, and that forwarding or distribution was strictly prohibited. The notices also instructed recipients who were not the intended recipients to return the message and destroy it.",

      "natural_language": "In February 2025, the Whispering Oaks development concerning the Ruhl home purchase was the subject of a series of update emails from Jody B. Gabel, General Counsel for Flagship Communities REIT, to Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal at The Whaley Law Firm, with ongoing notes about the progress of setting the home on the lot and the related utility and construction work.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, Jody advised that the home was being set and the two sections of the doublewide were being joined that day, with setters expected to return the following day to finish up loose ends. The water and sewer hookup had not yet been confirmed, and there was mention that the status could be affected by weather conditions. She noted that our Regional Manager reported that their clients were on site observing the work in progress, and she promised to provide an update if there was any new information on the water/sewer and electric connections.\n\nTwo days later, on February 13, 2025, Jody reported that the home setters were joining the two sections of the doublewide that day, with plans for the setters to return the next day to complete any remaining tasks. She indicated that water and sewer connections were still awaiting an update, and that weather conditions might influence the timeline. She stated that their Regional Manager had observed the clients on site. The schedule was electric hookup on Monday, water/sewer hookup on Tuesday, and a meeting with the deck builder on Wednesday to review plans. She acknowledged that the schedule could be affected by an incoming weather pattern forecast to bring several inches of rain and reaffirmed the team’s commitment to moving forward, with a Monday update anticipated to reflect any weather impacts.\n\nOn February 14, 2025, she again confirmed progress: workers were at the home finishing up the setup, electric hookup was planned for Monday, and water/sewer hookup was planned for Tuesday. The Regional Manager was set to meet with the company constructing the deck on Wednesday to go over the plans. She cautioned that the schedule was subject to the incoming weather and promised another update on Monday to assess weekend weather effects and next steps.\n\nBy February 18, 2025, Jody provided another status update. She stated that the home was set and siding completed, and that water and sewer were scheduled for setup that day, though she had not yet received confirmation. She warned that there could be a delay due to weather conditions and noted that the ETA for electric hookup had also been impacted by the weather. She pledged to pass along any updates as soon as they became available.\n\nFinally, on February 21, 2025, at 18:10:12 UTC, Jody sent a forward indicating that the water/sewer lines were being connected to the main water supply and that the electric hookup was being performed that day. She added that deck installation would begin at the beginning of the next week and that she would provide another update on Monday afternoon.\n\nAcross these communications, the consistent thread was ongoing progress with setting the home, progress on utility hookups, planned deck construction, and weather-related potential delays, all within the context of the Whispering Oaks – Ruhl Home Purchase.",

The update indicates the mobile home is almost ready. Progress includes siding on, water and sewer connected, and electric work in progress on Friday. Deck installation should be completed today, and a possible final inspection by the end of the week.\n\nRegarding the mold issue at the current apartment, the client reported mold concerns and was advised to send in photos; he did not expect the severity to be so bad upon photo review. He called Park Lake s/w Zach and requested a maintenance inspection and that mold be addressed, and he also requested LVM for Park Lake Attorney (John 859-231-0099). The client requested C/B. Maintenance completed the inspection, applied mold treatment, and stated the client should not be worried since they are moving. I advised the client that Louisville Code Enforcement Complaint had been filed on his behalf, and they will send someone out to inspect as well. The client advised several tenants are moving due to the mold issue. We advised the client to mention to the City Inspector when they come out. The client again appreciated the assistance with this matter.",

We contacted the Property Office and they requested we contact you. However, he & Maureen Abrasevic, reached out to us in regard to the housing issue. They provided the attached pictures yesterday and stated that the ceiling fell in, in November and the complex has done nothing about the mold or water damage. They did patch the ceiling, but there seems to still be moisture in the ceiling/walls. From our understanding multiple units are affected and several tenants are being forced to move due to the issue. Our client is in the process of moving out as well and simply requests their February Rent be refunded and not to be charged for March. They will vacate the property by the end of March as they are simply awaiting a final inspection of their new home to be scheduled. They are very concerned that the property office will simply find a new tenant & not address the concerns properly.

I've discussed the matter with Property Management and reviewed the work order history for this rental unit. We respectfully reject your demand for February and March Rent. The photos you've provided seem to involve three separate maintenance requests which occurred over several months and were all addressed in a timely manner: a roof leak, an open window creating condensation and a mold spot discovered behind a piece of furniture. Each matter was addressed within a matter of days after the resident notified Resident Services. Please note that the Resident's lease includes a mold and mildew addendum outlining steps that must be taken in the event the resident suspects a mold issue. Furthermore, the Kentucky Landlord Tenant Act provides a notice and opportunity to cure process that has not been followed by the resident.\n\nIf the attorney representing Mr. Ruhl (who is not a party to the written lease) would like to discuss this further, please have him or her contact me using the information below. Though I am admittedly unclear as to Whaley Law Firm's representation in this matter, I am happy to provide any clarification that may be necessary.\n\nThank you,\n\nD.

They did patch the ceiling, but there seems to still be moisture in the ceiling/walls. From our understanding multiple units are affected and several tenants are being forced to move due to the issue. Our client is in the process of moving out as well and simply requests their February Rent be refunded and not to be charged for March. They will vacate the property by the end of March as they are simply awaiting a final inspection of their new home to be scheduled. They are very concerned that the property office will simply find a new tenant & not address the concerns properly. We look forward to hearing from you once your investigation into the matter is complete.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle\nLitigation Paralegal &\nWorkers' Compensation Case Manager\nThe Whaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Lane\nLouisville, KY 40222\nD: (502) 357-9971\nO: (502) 583-4022 ext 104\nE: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\n(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS)",
      "natural_language": "In the matter of 7343 Leisure Court, Louisville, KY 40229, Timothy Ruhl and Maureen Abrasevic, the client is Timothy Ruhl. The case note dated September 14, 2023, records correspondence between Jon Strom, General Counsel for Anderson Communities, and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding a housing issue at the Leisure Court property. The Re line identifies the property and the tenants, Timothy Ruhl and Maureen Abrasevic.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mr. Strom. She clarified that her office represents Mr. Timothy Ruhl for an unrelated matter, but that Mr. Ruhl and Ms. Abrasevic had reached out regarding the housing issue. They had provided photographs the previous day and stated that a ceiling had fallen in November, that the complex had done nothing about the mold or water damage, and that although the ceiling had been patched, there remains moisture in the ceiling and walls. They alleged that multiple units were affected and that several tenants were being forced to move due to the issue. The clients were in the process of moving out and requested that their February rent be refunded and that they not be charged for March. They planned to vacate the property by the end of March, pending a final inspection of their new home, and they expressed concern that the property office would simply find a new tenant without addressing the concerns. They indicated they looked forward to hearing from Mr. Strom once the investigation into the matter was complete. Tuttle provided her contact details at The Whaley Law Firm, including her new email address.\n\nThe following day, February 26, 2025, Jon Strom responded to Ms. Tuttle. He stated that he had discussed the matter with Property Management and had reviewed the work order history for the rental unit. Anderson Communities respectfully rejected the demand for February and March rent. He explained that the photos provided appeared to reflect three separate maintenance requests that occurred over several months and were all addressed in a timely manner: a roof leak, an open window that created condensation, and a mold spot discovered behind a piece of furniture. Each issue was addressed within a matter of days after the resident notified Resident Services. Strom noted that the lease includes a mold and mildew addendum outlining the steps to be taken if the resident suspects a mold issue. He also pointed out that the Kentucky Landlord-Tenant Act provides a notice and opportunity-to-cure process that, in his view, has not been followed by the resident. Finally, he invited any attorney representing Mr. Ruhl—who is not a party to the written lease—to contact him to discuss the matter further and indicated he was willing to provide any necessary clarification, though he was unclear as to Whaley Law Firm’s representation in the matter. Strom provided his contact information and office details for follow-up.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023. Client: Timothy Ruhl. The following narrative summarizes the email communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Carelon Subrogation concerning Timothy Ruhl (case number 149197622) and the related lien and treatment records.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an external email to Christopher Sullivan of Carelon Subrogation regarding Timothy Ruhl (149197622). The message, which was CC’d to Sarena Tuttle and Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email TimothyRuhlDOIZ4668241@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, addressed the Timothy Ruhl lien statement. Koon stated that after reviewing the previously-provided lien statement, none of the listed charges appeared to be related to the incident at issue in their litigation. He noted that Mr. Ruhl has an extensively documented history of chronic back pain and low back injuries, and he argued that these charges should be removed as they are not related to their claim. He requested that Sullivan review the charges and provide an updated ledger reflecting any related payments at the earliest convenience. The email concluded with Koon’s signature and contained The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message also included a standard attorney-client confidential notice, stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information, and that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or forward the information to others.\n\nOn March 10, 2025, Christopher Sullivan, a Subrogation Analyst for Carelon Subrogation, replied to Bryce Koon. Sullivan asked for confirmation of the injuries being claimed and the last date of treatment to ensure the lien’s accuracy before removing all claims and closing the file. His message provided Carelon’s contact information: P.O. Box 659940, San Antonio, TX 78265-9939; Office phone: (502) 889-2010; fax: (844) 634-2520; email: christopher.sullivan@carelon.com. The reply also contained Carelon’s note that the company is paperless and requested that documentation be submitted in a single format (fax, email, or via website) to expedite a response.\n\nFinally, on April 15, 2025, at 03:22:58 GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon sent a follow-up email to Christopher Sullivan. In this message, Koon stated that the majority of the treatment he had for Timothy Ruhl originated from the week of September 14, 2023, and that this treatment was mostly head and face-related. He added that the only other treatment identified as potentially related involved pain-management procedures, but the last date of service for those was November 10, 2023. The email was signed by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the same firm contact details as before. The message again included The Whaley Law Firm’s confidentiality notice, indicating that the electronic communication is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information, with instructions to contact the firm if received in error and not to use or forward the information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023\nClient: Timothy Ruhl\n\nIn the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896), the following communications occurred concerning deposition scheduling and a global settlement demand. The client in this matter is Timothy Ruhl.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email titled “Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896)” to Charles Walker and tmarak@sonlegal.com, with William Orberson and Allison Wiles also included, and Timothy Ruhl copied via his Filevine project email address TimothyRuhlDOIZ4668241@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The message was addressed to Allison Wiles at PPOA Law and carried the subject line reflecting the case caption. Koon advised that attached was Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and stated that this would be the easiest method for everyone involved. He provided a Dropbox link for the documents: https://www.dropbox.com/t/B0AZo8uqazDxAEEC. The email closed with Koon’s signature, including The Whaley Law Firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and contact information (Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207). A standard confidentiality notice followed, indicating the message was intended only for the named recipient and warning against redistribution or disclosure if received in error.\n\nOn April 16, 2025, at 10:32 AM, Allison Wiles (Allie Orberson-Wiles) replied. She thanked Bryce for the demand and stated that the firm could not formally respond until they had Mr. Ruhl’s deposition. She requested that Bryce inform them when Mr. Ruhl would be available for his deposition. She invited further discussion if there were questions. The reply included her direct line (502-560-9955) and office line (502-583-9900), her email (aorberson-wiles@ppoalaw.com), and the firm’s office address (716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202). The firm’s standard confidentiality disclaimer followed in the signature block, noting the privileged nature of the communication and instructing the recipient to contact the sender to report an error if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier, on April 15, 2025, Bryce Koon had also sent a message to the recipients listed above, with the same case caption and subject. That message reiterated the attachment of Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and again pointed to the Dropbox link for access. The body stated that this method would be the easiest for everyone involved and invited questions or discussion if needed. The same signature block for The Whaley Law Firm and the same confidentiality notice appeared at the end of this email as well.\n\nFinally, on April 29, 2025, at 3:10:47 PM, Bryce Koon sent another email to Allie Wiles regarding the same case. He stated that he had spoken with his client about the deposition and that Thursdays appeared to be the best day for Mr. Ruhl’s availability. He proposed the date 06/05/25 and asked how that date sounded for everyone. The email included Koon’s standard firm signature with The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and address, followed by the same confidentiality disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and advising recipients who received it in error to notify the sender and delete the message.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects three principal communications: (1) April 15, 2025, a demand letter and global settlement demand sent with a Dropbox link; (2) April 16, 2025, a response from Allie Orberson-Wiles indicating deposition scheduling is a prerequisite to formal responses; and (3) April 29, 2025, a scheduling note proposing a Thursday deposition and suggesting June 5, 2025 as a proposed deposition date. The communications repeatedly reference deposition scheduling for Timothy Ruhl in the case against Hoosier Cargo, with formal responses contingent upon timely deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023. Client: Timothy Ruhl. This file covers communications in the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896).\n\nIn this sequence of emails, dated between mid-April and early May 2025, counsel discussed deposition scheduling and a global settlement demand. On April 15, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) sent a message to Charles Walker (cwalker@sonlegal.com) and Allison Wiles (aorberson-wiles@ppoalaw.com) regarding the Timothy Ruhl case. The email—sent with Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project address included in the CC line as TimothyRuhlDOIZ4668241@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com—carried the subject Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896). In the body, Bryce attached Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and provided a Dropbox link for access. The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm’s office address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm’s phone number 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. The email also carried the standard confidentiality/privilege disclaimer typical of correspondence from the firm. The recipients were Allie Orberson-Wiles and Charles Walker, with several others copied: tmarak@sonlegal.com, William Orberson (worberson@ppoalaw.com), Dawn Suter (dsuter@ppoalaw.com), Beth Alexander (balexander@ppoalaw.com), and Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email address.\n\nOn April 16, 2025 at 10:32?AM, Allison Wiles of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC (aorberson-wiles@ppoalaw.com) replied to Bryce. She thanked Bryce for the demand but stated that the firm could not formally respond until they had Mr. Ruhl’s deposition. She asked Bryce to let her know when Mr. Ruhl would be available for his deposition and closed with an invitation to discuss questions by phone if needed. Allie Orberson-Wiles provided her direct line (502-560-9955) and office line (502-583-9900) and repeated the firm’s address at 716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202. The response included the firm’s standard confidentiality disclaimer and privilege notice.\n\nEarlier, on April 15, 2025 at 3:58 PM, Bryce Koon again wrote to the same recipients (Charles Walker, tmarak@sonlegal.com; William Orberson; and Allison Wiles) with Timothy Ruhl’s name in the subject line Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896). In that message he attached Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and provided a Dropbox link for access. The CC line included Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email address as well. The email again echoed the confidentiality disclaimer customary to such communications, and it carried Bryce’s contact information at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nFinally, on April 29, 2025 at 3:10?PM, Bryce Koon sent Good afternoon counsel, stating that he had spoken with his client about deposition availability and noting that Thursdays seemed best for his client. He asked how 06/05/25 would work for everyone. Bryce again signed with The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details and included the standard confidentiality disclaimer in the thread.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, at 9:53:29 AM (GMT-04:00), Bryce followed up with a concise note: Good morning all, just wanted to circle back and see if this date worked for everyone. The May 5 message was sent from Bryce Koon, Esq., at The Whaley Law Firm, with the same Louisville address, phone, and fax, and it bore the same confidentiality disclaimer typical of the firm’s electronic communications. The To field for this latest message included Allison Wiles and Charles Walker, with Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email address again CC’d, along with tmarak, William Orberson, Dawn Suter, Beth Alexander, and Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine address.\n\nIn summary, the record shows a sequence of four key emails in mid-April to early May 2025: (1) April 15, 2025, Bryce Koon transmitted Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and provided a Dropbox link; (2) April 16, 2025, Allie Orberson-Wiles indicated that a deposition of Mr. Ruhl was a prerequisite to a formal response and asked for Mr. Ruhl’s availability; (3) April 29, 2025, Bryce proposed a deposition date window, noting Thursdays as preferable and asking if 06/05/25 would work; and (4) May 5, 2025, Bryce followed up to confirm whether the proposed date was workable for all parties. Throughout, multiple recipients and CCs were involved, and each email included the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "Timothy Ruhl is the client in the matter Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al., Jefferson 24-CI-005896. The attached case notes compile a series of email exchanges between counsel regarding the plaintiff’s deposition scheduling and a settlement demand, spanning mid-April to early May 2025, with the principal participants being W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and counsel for the defense at Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., representing the plaintiff, sent an email to Charles Walker, tmarak, William Orberson, Allison Wiles, and others, including the Timothy Ruhl Filevine project email, with the subject Re: Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896). In that message, he attached Plaintiff’s global settlement demand and noted that it would be the easiest method for everyone involved; he provided a Dropbox link for the documents and offered to discuss any questions.\n\nThe following day, April 16, 2025, Allison Orberson-Wiles of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC replied. She thanked Bryce for the demand and stated that PPOA could not formally respond until they have the deposition of Mr. Ruhl. She asked Bryce to inform them when Mr. Ruhl would be available for deposition and included her direct line (502-560-9943) and the firm’s contact details (716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202; Office Phone 502-583-9900; Fax 502-587-1927).\n\nEarlier, on April 29, 2025 at 3:10 PM, Bryce wrote to counsel again, indicating that he had spoken with his client about deposition availability and that Thursdays appeared to be the best day for Mr. Ruhl. He proposed 06/05/25 and asked how that date sounded for everyone. The message again included the firm’s standard confidentiality notice and Bryce’s contact information (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone 502-365-5043; Fax 502-237-3207).\n\nOn May 5, 2025 at 9:53 AM, Bryce followed up with a further note to the same recipients, asking for confirmation that 06/05/25 would work for everyone and indicating that he was checking everyone’s availability.\n\nOn May 6, 2025 at 2:34 PM, Dawn Suter, a legal assistant for William B. Orberson and Allison Orberson-Wiles at PPOA, replied to Bryce. She advised that the proposed date (06/05/25) would not work for their office and asked if they could consider a later date. She included her direct line (502-560-9943) and PPOA’s main contact details (716 West Main Street, Suite 300, Louisville, KY 40202; Office Phone 502-583-9900; Fax 502-587-1927) and reiterated the confidentiality disclaimer typical of PPOA communications. She also noted that the message was intended for the named recipient and requested that if the message was received in error, Bryce contact the firm and destroy the copies.\n\nThat same day, at 3:15:03 PM GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon replied with a proposed alternative: “How about the following Thursday, 6/12?” He sent the response from The Whaley Law Firm with his standard firm signature and the accompanying confidentiality language.\n\nSignatures and contact details appeared with each email. Bryce Koon’s signature identifies him as Esq. of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of 502-365-5043 and a fax number of 502-237-3207. The messages also consistently include the firm’s attorney-client privilege disclaimer. All communications reference the case caption and the Jefferson County docket number 24-CI-005896, and they repeatedly address scheduling Mr. Ruhl’s deposition and responding to the Plaintiff’s global settlement demand, including the Dropbox link provided in the April 15, 2025 email.\n\nIn summary, beginning with an April 15, 2025 email delivering the plaintiff’s global settlement demand, the parties engaged in a sequence of scheduling discussions about Mr. Ruhl’s deposition, with proposed dates of June 5 and June 12, 2025. PPOA’s Dawn Suter advised that June 5 would not work and requested a later date, and Bryce Koon subsequently proposed June 12, 2025 as an alternative. The communications maintained the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of the firms involved.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896), scheduling discussions regarding Mr. Timothy Ruhl’s deposition circulated among counsel starting with an email on April 29, 2025. W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, asked whether Thursday, June 5, 2025 would work for everyone as a deposition date, noting that Thursdays were the best day for his client. He asked that the matter be confirmed and that the deposition be set, and he added that he would have the necessary signature back to the recipients as soon as possible. His message included his firm’s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365-5043; fax (502) 237-3207, and contained attorney-client privilege language typical of an electronic communication.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up to see whether the proposed date of June 5, 2025 worked for everyone. By May 6, 2025, Dawn Suter, Legal Assistant to William B. Orberson and Allison Orberson-Wiles, replied that the date did not work for their office and asked if they could consider a date a little later. Later on May 6, 2025, Bryce Koon suggested alternative dates, specifically asking whether Thursday, June 12, 2025 would work. Dawn Suter responded earlier that day indicating that the June 12 date would not work for their office and again asking to go further out.\n\nCommunication continued with Dawn Suter replying again on May 8, 2025, at 2:42 PM, stating that June 12 at 10:00 would work for their side and that they would issue a notice if confirmed. In the same thread, at 3:31 PM on May 8, 2025, Taylor L. Marak, Esq., of Sewell & Neal, PLLC, responded that June 12 would not work for their office and that they needed to schedule deposition dates in August. Ms. Marak also attached an SSA Consent form for counsel’s client to complete so they could begin requesting those records, and she invited any questions. Her contact details included Sewell & Neal, PLLC, 220 West Main Street, Suite 1800, LG&E Center, Louisville, KY 40202; main line (502) 582-2030; direct line (502) 315-4682; fax (502) 561-0766; email tmarak@sonlegal.com; and the firm’s website www.sonlegal.com. She also included a legal-privilege notice typical of the firm.\n\nThe email chain also included prior correspondence on May 6 and May 5, illustrating a back-and-forth about the preferred date. Dawn Suter’s May 8 and May 9 exchanges show ongoing coordination among parties and offices regarding deposition timing and the related record requests. Specifically, on May 6, 2025, Dawn Suter had suggested a date further out after Bryce’s initial proposal; on May 6, 2025, Bryce proposed June 12 as an alternative; and on May 8, 2025, the parties discussed the infeasibility of June 12 for some offices and the need to consider August dates, with SSA consent forms to initiate record requests.\n\nFinally, on May 9, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a concluding note: Good afternoon, will August 14, 2025 work for everyone? He added that he would get the necessary documents signed and return them as soon as possible. The May 9 email was sent with the same recipients and CC list as prior messages and carried the same attorney-client privilege cautions. The CC list for these messages included Taylor Marak, Dawn Suter, Allison Wiles, William Orberson, Beth Alexander, Michael Nisbet, Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email address, and Sarena Tuttle, among others. The thread reflects ongoing scheduling efforts, the need to secure complete records before deposition, and the consideration of August dates for Mr. Ruhl’s deposition in the Jefferson County case.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo, et al. (Jefferson County case 24-CI-005896), counsel began a scheduling dialogue in May and June 2025. The file contains multiple back-and-forth emails among the lawyers at The Whaley Law Firm, Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC, and Sewell & Neal, PLLC, concerning the deposition of the Plaintiff, Timothy Ruhl. The client is Timothy Ruhl, and the correspondence includes a Filevine project email address for him in the CC line. The emails also show standard attorney‑client privilege notices accompanying each transmission.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, Taylor L. Marak of Sewell & Neal (addressed to Bryce Koon) apologized for a delayed response and explained that they would not be able to make the June 12 deposition date work. She requested potential dates in August and noted that an SSA Consent form had been attached for use in obtaining the requested records, inviting any questions. The message carried the customary confidentiality notice and signature block for Sewell & Neal. In response, later that same day, Bryce W. Koon of The Whaley Law Firm asked whether August 14 would work for everyone and promised to get the matter signed back as soon as possible.\n\nThe following day, May 9, 2025, Taylor Marak replied that 8/14 works for them. Bryce then followed up with a separate message asking, “Good afternoon, will 8/14 work for you all? In the meantime will get this signed and back to you as soon as I can.” Later that day, May 9, 2025, Taylor Marak again confirmed, “8/14 works for us,” and provided her firm’s contact details and a standard privilege notice.\n\nOn May 28, 2025, Taylor L. Kellebrew of Sewell & Neal (copying Bryce Koon and others) followed up on Plaintiff’s deposition, asking whether they should proceed with 8/14 and requesting confirmation. She also asked for an update on the SSA consent form mentioned previously. The notice in this and subsequent messages reiterated confidentiality and privilege protections.\n\nBy May 8 through May 28, the parties were clearly evaluating August dates for the deposition, with 8/14 initially proposed and 8/18 later appearing in the conversation. In the June 10, 2025 exchanges, Allison Wiles of Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC indicated that there remained a hold for the 18th, and Bryce Koon replied that they were good for the 18th as well. This exchange suggests that both August 14 and August 18 remained on the table, with at least one date being held or tentatively confirmed.\n\nThe chain also reveals the participants involved in the discussion, including Wiles, Allison; Allie Orberson-Wiles (the attorney who signed the reply); Taylor Kellebrew and Taylor Marak from Sewell & Neal; Bryce Koon from The Whaley Law Firm; Dawn Suter; Beth Alexander; Michael Nisbet; the Timothy Ruhl Filevine project email address; and Sarena Tuttle. The message headers include the customary disclosures about privilege, forwarding restrictions, and the intended recipients, along with the contact details for the respective law offices (The Whaley Law Firm, Sewell & Neal, PLC, and Phillips Parker Orberson & Arnett, PLC). The CC line also shows Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project address, underscoring that the deposition scheduling involved multiple parties and their representatives.\n\nIn summary, between May and June 2025, counsel communicated about scheduling Plaintiff Timothy Ruhl’s deposition in this case, considering August 14 and August 18 as potential dates, with a specific note that June 12 was not feasible and that an SSA consent form was to be obtained. As of the June 10 correspondence, there was a hold on the 18th, and all parties indicated viability for the 18th as well, reflecting ongoing negotiation to finalize a deposition date.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo Express, Jefferson 24-CI-005896, the case file labeled Timothy-Ruhl-Premise-09-14-2023 shows that counsel correspondence occurred in mid-2025 concerning discovery. On May 15, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Michael Nisbet and Taylor Marak (cc’d Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project address and Tess Moloney) attaching Plaintiff Timothy Ruhl’s Discovery Requests for Defendants Austin Whitman and Trey Cooper. The attachments included Word copies of the discovery requests, and Koon invited any questions. The message carried The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nShortly afterward, on May 15, 2025 at 1:06 PM, Taylor L. Kellebrew of Sewell & Neal, PLLC replied: “Received. Thank you, Bryce. I’ll start working on these.” Her signature identified Sewell & Neal, PLLC and provided her firm’s Louisville, Kentucky contact details and licensing information.\n\nThe following day, May 16, 2025, at approximately 10:01 AM, Kellebrew sent another message noting a development: Bryce had propounded discovery requests to Austin Whitman, but CourtNet indicated Whitman had not been served yet, and the firm had been unable to reach him, which prevented them from filing an Answer on his behalf. Consequently, they were unable to respond to the discovery requests directed to Whitman at that time. She added that she would begin working on Trey Cooper’s responses as previously stated. The message again carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nOn Friday, July 11, 2025, at 12:23:53 PM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon sent a follow-up email to counsel, asking for an update on Defendant Cooper’s discovery responses and indicating that any update would be appreciated. This message also included the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondence involved the plaintiff Timothy Ruhl, the defendants Whitman and Cooper, and counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Sewell & Neal, PLLC. Each email included the appropriate confidentiality or privilege notices, and the emails displayed the recipients and CCs, including Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project email address and the other listed counsel.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo Express, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-005896), the correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and Sewell & Neal, PLLC centered on discovery and client verification matters. On July 11, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Taylor Kellebrew of Sewell & Neal, PLLC, with copies to Michael Nisbet and Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine project address, stating that he planned to visit the defendant’s client to obtain a signature the following week and would send the signed document afterward. He provided his firm’s contact information in the message and included the standard attorney-client confidentiality disclaimer found in these electronic communications.\n\nTaylor Kellebrew replied later that day, indicating she had not been able to reach her client to obtain his verification sheet. She noted that the last update she had was that the client was experiencing car trouble and planned to have the document notarized the next day, but since then there had been no further updates despite numerous attempts to contact him. She said she would continue efforts to reach him and provide his responses as soon as possible. She also asked whether there was any update on her client’s social security authorization form. Her message included her contact information and a confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier in the chain, Bryce Koon had followed up on defendant Cooper’s discovery responses. On May 11, 2025, he wrote to Taylor Kellebrew, Michael Nisbet, and Timothy Ruhl’s Filevine address that he was seeking updates on the discovery responses for the matter, and he attached Word copies of the materials for convenience. The May 11 message was part of an ongoing exchange regarding Plaintiff’s discovery requests for the defendants Austin Whitman and Trey Cooper.\n\nA day earlier, on May 15, 2025 at 1:06 PM, Taylor Kellebrew responded to Bryce, confirming receipt and stating she would start working on the requests. She explained that Austin Whitman had not been served, according to CourtNet, and that they had been unable to reach him, which prevented them from filing an Answer on his behalf and thus prevented a timely response to the discovery requests directed at Whitman. She added that she would begin working on Trey Cooper’s responses as she had previously indicated. This exchange carried the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier on May 15, 2025 at 1:03 PM, Bryce had sent a separate email to counsel attaching Plaintiff’s Discovery Requests for the defendants Austin Whitman and Trey Cooper, with Word copies included for convenience, and inviting any questions. He again provided his contact information and the firm’s signature block, along with the same attorney-client confidentiality notice.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects a multi-month sequence of discovery-related communications concerning three defendants (Whitman, Cooper, and the unnamed defendant in Taylor’s May 16 message) and the status of service and responses. The July 11, 2025 exchange adds a practical step toward obtaining the client’s signature on a document, with ongoing challenges in obtaining the verification sheet due to the client’s availability, and continued questions regarding the social security authorization form. Each message in the thread contained the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of these communications.",

      "natural_language": "The structured case note chronicles email communications in the matter of Timothy Ruhl v. Hoosier Cargo Express, et al., Jefferson County case number 24-CI-005896. The record shows ongoing discussions between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Sewell & Neal, PLLC, with Timothy Ruhl cc’d via the FileVine project address, regarding discovery responses and related authorizations.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Taylor Kellebrew and Michael Nisbet, with Timothy Ruhl copied on the FileVine project address, stating that an authorization was attached. The message was accompanied by the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer. The contact details listed for Bryce Koon and The Whaley Law Firm appear in the email signature, along with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address, phone, and fax numbers.\n\nEarlier, on July 11, 2025, Taylor Kellebrew of Sewell & Neal, PLLC emailed Bryce noting difficulty obtaining her client’s verification sheet. She reported that the client had been experiencing car trouble and planned to have the document notarized the following day, but since then there had been no further updates despite numerous attempts to contact him. She asked whether there was any update on her client’s social security authorization form. Her message included her firm’s contact information and a confidentiality notice.\n\nThat same day, Bryce replied to Taylor, following up on Defendant Cooper’s discovery responses and requesting any available updates. His message also carried the Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality disclaimer and provided his contact information.\n\nPrior to these July exchanges, on May 15, 2025, Bryce Koon sent Plaintiff’s Discovery Requests for Defendants Austin Whitman and Trey Cooper, including Word copies for convenience. The communication advised that the discovery requests had been attached and invited any questions. Taylor Marak of Sewell & Neal acknowledged receipt on May 15, 2025 at 1:06 PM and stated she would begin working on the responses.\n\nThe chain continued on May 16, 2025, when Taylor Marak wrote that Bryce’s discovery requests had been propounded to Austin Whitman. She noted, according to CourtNet, that Whitman had not been served yet and that they had been unable to reach him, which prevented filing an Answer and adapting responses at that time. She added that they would begin working on Trey Cooper’s responses as previously stated.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a sequence of discovery-related activity beginning mid-May 2025, with there being requests directed at Austin Whitman and Trey Cooper, concerns about service and ability to respond for Whitman, and an ongoing effort to address Trey Cooper’s responses. By July 29, 2025, a separate email indicates an attached authorization, and the correspondence continues to involve coordinating with opposing counsel and updating Timothy Ruhl on the status of these matters, all while maintaining the customary attorney-client privilege notices attached to each electronic message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Timothy-Ruhl-A-B-9-14-2023\nClient: Timothy Ruhl\n\nThis is a narrative summary of the November 7, 2025 call relating to the Timothy Ruhl case. The summary was prepared by Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and sent to Timothy Ruhl via his Filevine project email on November 7, 2025 at 12:48:38 PM (GMT-05:00). The call with Charles A. Walker occurred earlier that day at 12:41 PM (UTC-05:00). The discussion centered on depositions and mediation scheduling, with a plan to locate a key witness and draft an amended complaint.\n\nDuring the recap, Charles A. Walker informed Aaron Whaley that the discovery response is ready and clarified that they were not trying to mislead about the appropriate person involved; the person identified is Martin, not Austin Whitman. Aaron Whaley indicated a willingness to discuss settlement numbers but stressed that depositions would be necessary if liability is disputed, noting that mediation would be difficult without both parties’ participation. Walker acknowledged that contacting Martin has been challenging and confirmed that they have not yet made contact with him; they are relying on information from Trey Cooper regarding Martin’s presence at the incident. Whaley proposed drafting an amended complaint while attempting to locate Martin, reflecting a collaborative approach to resolving the case. Both parties agreed to reconvene in a week to discuss progress and to potentially schedule depositions for Trey Cooper and others involved.\n\nAs for next steps, Charles A. Walker will attempt to locate Martin and confirm his employment status with Who's Your Cargo. Aaron Whaley will draft an amended complaint and use available resources to locate Martin.\n\nBest,\nAaron Whaley",
