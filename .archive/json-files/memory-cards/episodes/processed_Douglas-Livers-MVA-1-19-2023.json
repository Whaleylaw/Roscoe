He mentions that he could have used money provided by the insurance company to arrange rides back and forth, but there was no one telling him or advising him on this issue.

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. The matter concerns the external claim 0700228547.\n\nOn November 28, 2023, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm wrote to Justin Chumbley regarding the case. In her message, she said she had called Dixie Injury and Rehab, and they confirmed the client had received treatment there. However, Dixie Injury and Rehab indicated they have a different Allstate claim number for the same date of loss. Jessa stated that she would call Allstate to seek clarification.\n\nEarlier that same day, Justin had sent a message (dated November 28, 2023 at 12:29 PM, though the time is shown with a question mark in the record) instructing to verify that the correct provider is listed in the medical tab and to ensure the PIP information is correct. The thread then includes an Allstate response to that inquiry.\n\nThe Allstate reply, sent at 12:05 PM on November 28, 2023, stated: \u201cThere is no file to send as no bills or records have been received. Please let me know if any questions or concerns.\u201d The message was signed by Brittany Carr of Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company, with contact details: Phone (713) 277-9437, Fax (608) 373-7383, claims@claims.allstate.com. The email also contained a confidentiality/privacy notice and indicated the unique Conversation ID: FRc720409cc1dc47.\n\nThe prior portion of the thread shows Justin\u2019s earlier request to Allstate, dated Monday, November 27, 2023 at 11:38 AM, in which he asked: \u201cPlease forward a complete copy of the PIP file for our client, Douglas Livers.\u201d The thread includes Allstate\u2019s responses and signatures, as well as the standard Allstate email footer.\n\nThe correspondence concludes with Jessa\u2019s sign-off: \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo, Whaley Law Firm,\u201d followed by her phone number (502) 357-9975 and fax number (502) 364-9363. The record also notes Jessa\u2019s initials on her messages and the ongoing plan to seek clarification from Allstate regarding the claim and provider information.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023, involving client Douglas Livers in the matter of Livers v Allstate, an email exchange took place on July 23, 2024 between members of The Whaley Law Firm and TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC. The communication thread centered on obtaining and sharing the Word version of discovery propounded to Allstate.\n\nAt 2:54 PM that day, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Ginny Donnell with the Word version attached. In her message, she wrote: \u201cGood afternoon Ginny, Please find the WORD Version Attached. If you need anything else please do not hesitate to contact us directly.\u201d She also added, \u201cPlease add Bryce Koon & myself to any future email chains.\u201d Her signature identified her as Sarena M. Tuttle, with the title Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, and provided The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct dial (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. She noted that this was a new email address.\n\nThe email chain included a prior thread in which Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm forwarded the request. His message, listing his own contact information (Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022), appears as part of the forwarded correspondence that followed Sarena\u2019s message.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Ginny Donnell had sent a message dated July 23, 2024, at about 2:32 PM, with the subject line \u201cLivers v Allstate,\u201d addressed to Aaron Whaley. In that message she asked: \u201cCould your assistant please send me the word version of discovery propounded to Allstate in this case?\u201d Donnell identified herself as the Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson at TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, located at 11507 Main Street, in the Middletown Historic District of Louisville, KY 40243. Her contact details were provided as PH: (502) 245-7474 and FAX: (502) 245-7025, and a website address www.thslaw.co.\n\nThe message chain also included standard cautions and disclaimers. Donnell\u2019s email contained a Privileged and Confidential notice stating that the information in the message is Attorney Privileged and Confidential Information intended for the named recipient, and that dissemination, distribution, or copying is prohibited if the reader is not the intended recipient; readers were asked to notify the sender by telephone if the message was received in error and to delete it. It further stated that there is no attorney-client relationship created by sending or receiving email with the firm. The message also included the firm\u2019s acknowledgment of the disclaimer at www.thattorneys.com.\n\nAdditionally, the email contained a note referencing IRS Circular 230 warnings: since the document did not include all required tax disclosures, the reader should not rely on any tax advice contained in the document to avoid penalties, and no portion of the document may be used in marketing or promotional materials. The sequence reflects the logistical steps to share the Word version of discovery and to coordinate future communications for the Livers v Allstate matter.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023\nClient: Douglas Livers\n\nIn the IV-D case IV-D 0005568409 for Douglas Livers and Theresa Gregory, an email exchange took place between the Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement (AES) and The Whaley Law Firm. On August 13, 2024, Amy Fleming, Administrative Enforcement Section Supervisor, wrote to Sarena Tuttle. Fleming stated that AES had received the request for documentation of a lien and that a request had been sent to obtain an audit of the case. She noted that once AES receives the audit results, they would email the documents as attachments and asked to be informed if any additional information was needed. Fleming provided her contact details and added that one can register for a free account online to view activity and make payments on child support at csws.chfs.ky.gov/csws/. The email also included a confidentiality notice indicating the message and any attachments are for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential information; unauthorized review, use, disclosure, or distribution is prohibited, and if you are not the intended recipient, you should destroy all copies and notify the sender. The notice also contained a reminder to contact the sender if there are questions, and included the sender\u2019s email address, Amy.Fleming@ky.gov, and phone number 502-564-2285.\n\nThe prior correspondence in the same IV-D case involved Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. On August 12, 2024, at 3:15 PM, Tuttle sent an email to CHFS DIS CSE CSLN Communication with the subject IV-D 0005568409 Douglas Livers & Theresa Gregory. The body of her email, which carried a caution about PDF attachments potentially linking to malicious sites, stated that this message was a follow-up to a voicemail left moments earlier. Tuttle indicated that her office had been provided a copy of a lien dated February 15, 2023 from Allstate Insurance. She noted, however, that the lien notice listed an expiration date of July 31, 2021. The email further stated that the lien did not include any ledgers and/or supporting documentation. Tuttle requested that the recipient provide an updated payment ledger along with any and all supporting documents retained by their office for immediate review and consideration. She warned that if the requested information was not received within 30 days, they would have to assume the lien had expired and/or been satisfied prior to the request. She closed by inviting any questions and offering to discuss the lien in further detail, and signed with her name, title (Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager), the Whaley Law Firm, and contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details align with the firm\u2019s address and phone lines, and the note highlights a new email address for Sarena Tuttle.

Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, sent an email to Amy F. Fleming of the Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement, regarding the file labeled \u201cDouglas Livers IVD 5568409.\u201d In her message, she noted that, after reviewing the documents provided, they could only find a payment ledger and did not see any Court Order attached. She requested verification that Mr. Livers was actually court-ordered to make payments and asked for the exact amount ordered, adding that any and all amendments to any orders should be included.\n\nSarena also provided the firm\u2019s contact information and noted that this was her new email address. Her signature listed The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nAmy Fleming replied, at 1:56 PM, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d and included her own contact information: Amy Fleming, Administrative Enforcement Section Supervisor, Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement, Administrative Enforcement Section, 502-564-2285, and a link to register for a free online account to view activity and make payments at csws.chfs.ky.gov/csws/. Her message also contained a confidentiality notice stating the message and attachments are for the intended recipient and may contain confidential information, with instructions to destroy copies and notify the sender if not the intended recipient.\n\nIn a follow-up, Sarena responded at 1:54 PM, stating, \u201cAwesome. Thank you for your assistance. We will review these documents with our client.\u201d Her signature again included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and contact details, and reminded that the email address was new.\n\nEarlier in the thread, at 1:51 PM, Amy Fleming had written: \u201cGood afternoon, Please find attached supporting documents audit completed 8/14/24. If any other information is needed please let us know.\u201d Her signature block appeared with the same organizational details as above, followed by the confidentiality notice.\n\nOverall, the exchange centered on obtaining a court-ordered payment obligation for Douglas Livers, as the records provided only contained a payment ledger rather than a Court Order, and included the attached documents audit completed on 8/14/24. The participants exchanged several brief confirmations and notices about confidentiality and online access.",

This is an email thread concerning Douglas Livers IVD 5568409, with the subject line FW: Douglas Livers IVD 5568409. The exchange involves Amy Fleming of the Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement (Administrative Enforcement Section), and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, related to court-ordered child support in the case.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, at 1:51 PM, Amy Fleming sent an email noting that she was attaching supporting documents and that an audit had been completed on August 14, 2024. She invited the recipient to contact her if any additional information was needed. Her message included her signature, listing her role as Administrative Enforcement Section Supervisor, contact number 502-564-2285, and a link for online access to view activity and make payments at csws.chfs.ky.gov/csws/. A standard confidentiality notice accompanied the email, stating that the message and any attachments are for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential information, with instructions to destroy copies and notify the sender if not the intended recipient.\n\nAt 1:54 PM that day, Sarena Tuttle replied, thanking for the assistance and stating that they would review the documents with their client. Her signature block identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and providing the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), and phone numbers (D: 502-357-9971, O: 502-583-4022 ext 104).\n\nShortly after, at 1:56 PM, Amy Fleming replied, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d and again included the standard confidentiality notice along with her CHFS contact information and online access link.\n\nThe thread continued at 2:40 PM with Sarena Tuttle writing to Amy Fleming. She commented that, upon review, they only saw a payment ledger and that there did not appear to be a Court Order attached. She requested verification that Mr. Livers was actually court-ordered to make payments and the amount that was ordered, and asked that any and all amendments to any and all orders be included.\n\nIn the same thread, the correspondence shows Amy Fleming\u2019s final note in the sequence: \"Please find attached copy of Court orders entered.\" She reiterated her contact details and the online account availability, including the same link to csws.ky.gov.

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023\nClient: Douglas Livers\n\nRe: FW: Douglas Livers IVD 5568409\n\nIn August 2024, communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement, regarding a lien related to Douglas Livers. On August 21, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Amy Fleming of CHFS. She thanked Amy for her assistance and for the copies of the order. Based on the review of the documents submitted, Sarena noted that a motion was allegedly filed on October 2, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers. However, the orders provided were not attested by the judge. Consequently, unless other documents could be provided for review, Sarena stated they could not verify that Mr. Livers was actually ordered to pay child support. As a result, she requested the removal of the lien until an actual Court Order could be produced. She asked Amy to submit a notice of lien revocation as soon as possible and/or submit a formal Court Order validating the lien.\n\nSarena\u2019s signature included her title and contact information: Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to note the new email address.\n\nEarlier, on August 19, 2024, communications were exchanged. At 1:51 PM, Amy Fleming wrote to Sarena that she would be sending a copy of Court orders entered (with her contact details and confidentiality notice). On August 19 at 1:54 PM, Sarena replied: \u201cAwesome. Thank you for your assistance. We will review these documents with our client.\u201d Her message also included her role and contact details and reiterated the new email address.\n\nAt 1:56 PM, Amy responded: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d with her title as Administrative Enforcement Section Supervisor for the Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement, and her phone number (502-564-2285), plus a note that recipients could register for a free account online to view activity and make payments at csws.chfs.ky.gov/csws/, and a confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 2:40 PM, Sarena sent another message stating that, upon review, they only saw a payment ledger and there did not appear to be a Court Order attached. She requested verification that Mr. Livers was actually court ordered to make payments and the amount ordered, and asked that any amendments to any orders be included as well.\n\nAt 2:53 PM, Amy Fleming replied with a message that included: \u201cPlease find attached copy of Court orders entered,\u201d along with her standard signature block and confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 2:55 PM, Sarena responded: \u201cAwesome. Thank you so much.\u201d\n\nIn a prior thread, on August 19, 2024 around 2:40 PM to 2:55 PM, there was a chain where Sarena reiterated the need for verification of a Court Order and any amendments, while Amy provided attached Court orders in response to that request. The August 21 email from Sarena summarized the substance of these exchanges and reiterated the request for proof of an actual Court Order or an appropriate lien revocation.\n\nSupporting documents referenced in the email chain included an audit of supporting documents completed on August 14, 2024, which Amy had previously attached and noted as available for review. The correspondence also included standard confidentiality notices and contact information typical of the parties\u2019 communications. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s signature block repeatedly noted Sarena\u2019s role and indicated the new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, in addition to the firm\u2019s Louisville, KY mailing address and phone numbers.\n\nIn summary, the core issue communicated across these exchanges is that there was a motion allegedly filed on October 2, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers, but the orders provided were not attested by a judge. Because of this, the lien against Douglas Livers could not be verified as valid, and the lien needed to be removed unless a formal Court Order validating the lien could be produced. The parties exchanged copies of Court orders and requested verification of the existence and terms of any court-ordered child support, including any amendments to relevant orders, with the goal of either obtaining a valid Court Order or revoking the lien.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023 involves Douglas Livers and concerns an interstate child support matter identified as IVD 5568409. In August 2024, Amy Fleming of the Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement (Administrative Enforcement Section), exchanged a series of emails with Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, regarding court orders connected to a lien and the underlying obligation.\n\nOn August 21, 2024 at 7:47 p.m. UTC, Amy Fleming sent Sarena Tuttle a message stating, \u201cSarena, please find attached order established 12/7/15.\u201d Fleming\u2019s message included her contact information and a confidentially-notice indicating that the message and any attachments were for the sole use of the intended recipient and may contain confidential information; it also directed any unintended recipients to destroy copies and notify the sender. Fleming\u2019s message also reminded that the Kentucky CSWS (Child Support Workstation) site offers free online account registration to view activity and make payments.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:44 p.m., Fleming informed Tuttle that the CSE did not have access to the order at that time and that a request had been sent to the Hall of Justice to obtain a copy, noting that the order was set out of a domestic violence order (DVO) and later incorporated into the CI docket; she added that the 10/3/17 order confirms enforcement purposes for the obligation amount along with a retroactive effective date, and she would send a copy once received.\n\nAt 2:08 p.m. on August 21, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied to Fleming, thanking her for assistance and the copies of the order. She explained that, based on their review of the submitted documents, they understood a motion had been made on October 2, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers. She stated that the provided orders were not attested by the judge, and absent additional documents for review, they could not verify that Mr. Livers was actually ordered to pay child support. Consequently, she said they would have to request removal of the lien until an actual Court Order could be produced, and she asked that Fleming submit a notice of lien revocation as soon as possible and/or submit a formal Court Order validating the lien. Tuttle\u2019s signature block included her new email address, phone numbers, and firm details.\n\nEarlier, at 2:55 p.m. on August 19, 2024, Sarena wrote, \u201cAwesome. Thank you so much,\u201d followed by her standard signature block. At 2:53 p.m. Fleming replied, \u201cPlease find attached copy of Court orders entered,\u201d including her contact information and again the confidentially notice. The same day, at 2:40 p.m., Sarena had written to Fleming noting that, upon review, they only saw a payment ledger and no Court Order attached. She requested verification that Mr. Livers was actually court-ordered to make payments and to specify the amount ordered, asking that any amendments to all orders be included.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, at 1:56 p.m., Fleming responded, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome!\u201d and reiterated the confidentiality statement. Earlier, at 1:54 p.m., Sarena had written to Fleming thanking her for the assistance and indicating they would review the documents with their client.\n\nIn sum, the exchange reveals that CHFS located an order described as established on December 7, 2015, and Fleming later indicated that the CSE did not yet have access to the order and was seeking a copy from the Hall of Justice. Fleming also noted a 10/3/17 order related to enforcement and retroactive date, with plans to send the copy when obtained. Tuttle, however, raised concerns that the October 2, 2015 motion by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers was not attested by a judge and that the orders provided were not court-attested, leading to a request to revoke the lien unless a formal court order validating the lien could be produced. The parties also discussed that the only attached material initially appeared to be a payment ledger, not a court order, and that any payment-related order details and amendments needed to be provided for verification.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the communications surrounding the Douglas Livers case (IVD 5568409) in August 2024, as it relates to a child support/ Family Court enforcement matter tied to the client Douglas Livers.\n\nThe file begins with a case note dated January 19, 2023, listed as Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023, for client Douglas Livers. The subject line referenced is FW: Douglas Livers IVD 5568409. On August 21, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Amy Fleming of the Kentucky Department for Income Support (CHFS), Administrative Enforcement Section, to acknowledge payment and to request that the Formal Child Support Order be forwarded upon receipt. In her message, Sarena stated: \u201cThank you. This order covers the period from the date of issuance until the Family Court matter was resolved. Please forward the Formal Child Support Order upon receipt.\u201d Her signature included her contact information and note of her new email address.\n\nEarlier in the day, on August 21, 2024, at approximately 3:47 PM, Amy Fleming replied to Sarena with the information: \u201cSarena, Please find attached order established 12/7/15.\u201d Fleming\u2019s message also contained her professional title and contact details.\n\nAdditionally, a preceding exchange on August 21, 2024 shows that Fleming had informed Sarena that CSE did not currently have access to the order and that a request had been sent to the Hall of Justice to obtain a copy. Fleming noted that the order was set out of a domestic violence order (DVO) and later incorporated into the CI docket; she indicated that the 10/3/17 order confirms enforcement purposes for the obligation amount along with a retroactive effective date, and that she would send a copy once received.\n\nIn the interim communications on August 21, 2024, Sarena also conveyed concerns about the sufficiency and attestation of the documents. At approximately 2:08 PM, she wrote that, after reviewing the submitted documents, a motion had been made on October 2, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers. She explained that the provided orders were not attested by the judge, and unless additional documents were provided for review, they could not verify that Mr. Livers was actually ordered to pay child support. Consequently, she requested the removal of CHFS\u2019s lien until an actual court order could be produced and asked that notice of lien revocation be submitted promptly, or that a Formal Court Order validating the lien be provided. Her message, like others, included her professional signature block and note about the new email address.\n\nEarlier still, on August 19, 2024, Sarena thanked Amy for the assistance and copies of the order, but noted that, based on the documents submitted, the file only contained a payment ledger with no attached court order. She requested verification that Mr. Livers was actually court-ordered to make payments and asked that any and all amendments to orders be included. Amy responded on August 19 with a message indicating that copies of court orders had been attached, and Sarena again replied later that day with appreciation.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the participants referenced the need for a formal court order to validate any lien and to confirm the amounts and existence of child support obligations. They also discussed the availability of orders and the process to obtain or validate them, including potential retroactive dates and enforcement purposes noted in orders identified as 10/3/17, and the relationship between DVO-derived orders and CI docket entries.\n\nIn sum, the communications reflect ongoing efforts to verify and obtain a Formal Child Support Order for Douglas Livers, ensure that a lien is properly supported by an actual court order, and determine the enforcement period and related retroactive dates. The most recent development in the chain was Amy Fleming\u2019s August 21, 2024 response indicating an attached order dated 12/7/15 and the expectation that the Formal Child Support Order would be forwarded upon receipt.",

Unfortunately, based on the review of the submitted documents, we understand a motion was made on October 2nd, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers.

      "natural_language": "Narrative summary of the communications regarding Douglas Livers (IVD 5568409) between The Whaley Law Firm and the Kentucky Department for Income Support, Child Support Enforcement (CHFS), dated August 19\u201321, 2024.\n\nThe thread opens on August 19, 2024, when Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, contacts Amy Fleming of CHFS after reviewing the case materials. At 2:40 PM, Sarena explains that, based on the submitted documents, they only have a payment ledger and no court order attached. She asks CHFS to provide verification that Mr. Douglas Livers was actually court-ordered to make payments and to specify the amount ordered, requesting that any amendments to orders be included as well. She signs with her office information and notes a new email address.\n\nAt 2:53 PM, Amy Fleming responds with a different update, stating, \u201cPlease find attached copy of Court orders entered.\u201d Her signature includes her CHFS contact information and confidentiality notice.\n\nShortly after, at 2:55 PM, Sarena replies, thanking Amy and acknowledging the correspondence. She confirms receipt of the copies and notes appreciation for the assistance.\n\nThe next day, August 21, 2024, the exchange continues with more detail about the underlying orders. At 2:08 PM, Sarena writes that a motion was made on October 2, 2015 by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers. She states that the orders provided are not attested by the judge and, unless CHFS can supply additional documents for review, they cannot verify that Mr. Livers was actually ordered to pay child support or the amount ordered. Consequently, she requests removal of CHFS\u2019s lien until an actual court order can be produced and asks CHFS to submit a notice of lien revocation as soon as possible and/or submit a Formal Court Order validating the lien.\n\nAt 2:44 PM, Amy responds that CSE does not have access to the order at that time. She explains that a request has been sent to the Hall of Justice to obtain a copy, noting that the order had been set out of a Domestic Violence Order (DVO) and later incorporated into the CI docket. She mentions that the 10/3/2017 order confirms enforcement purposes for the obligation amount along with a retroactive effective date, and she commits to sending a copy once it is received.\n\nAt 2:53 PM, Sarena replies again, expressing appreciation for the information but reiterating that, based on the reviewed documents, the October 2, 2015 motion by Wende Raderer on behalf of Theresa Livers is not attested by a judge. She emphasizes that, without an actual Court Order or a formally attested document, they cannot verify that Mr. Livers was ordered to pay child support or determine the amounts. She requests the submission of a lien revocation notice as soon as possible and/or submission of a Formal Court Order validating the lien.\n\nLater that same day, at 3:47 PM, Amy sends another message. She writes, \u201cSarena, Please find attached order established 12/7/15.\u201d The signature lines again include Amy Fleming\u2019s CHFS contact information and the confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 3:54 PM, Sarena replies, confirming receipt of the attached order and stating that the order covers the period from the date of issuance until the Family Court matter was resolved. She asks that, upon receipt, CHFS forward the Formal Child Support Order. She signs with her office details and new email address.\n\nFinally, at 8:00 PM on August 21, 2024, Amy reiterates and attaches the order again, writing, \u201cPlease find attached order per request.\u201d Her email signature again provides CHFS contact information and the confidentiality notice, and she invites the recipient to register for a free online account to view activity and make payments on child support.\n\nThroughout the thread, Confidentiality notices appear in the email signatures, indicating that the messages and attachments are for the sole use of the intended recipients and may contain confidential information. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s communications include the sender\u2019s and recipient\u2019s contact details, including Sarena M. Tuttle\u2019s title and new email address. The CHFS communications include Amy Fleming\u2019s title and contact information, along with the online account registration invitation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. On August 22, 2024, the initial client contact was made with Sarena regarding Douglas Livers and the motor vehicle accident. The client thought the claim was over and was told that there is a 30-day deadline to answer the Discovery Request, but that deadline does not end the claim. He felt the claim was over because he could not answer most of the Discovery Request. He explained that the truck he was driving was his employer's vehicle and he was on the way to a job when the MVA occurred. After the accident, the employer stressed that he should say he had merely borrowed the truck and was not en route to a job site. He further explained that the employer was paying him under the table, as well as several others, and was pushing him not to say anything about work since the employer is under contract and does not have proper insurance coverages. I advised that I would discuss this fact with BK in further detail, and noted that there may be a workers\u2019 compensation claim opened with the Special Fund for Uninsured Workers.\n\nDiscussed medical treatment: the client has a foot injury that is broken and has healed; the left shoulder requires surgery but the client cannot afford it due to no health insurance; ringing in the left ear remains present; he is unable to lift the left shoulder; he does not have a primary care physician. Dixie and Aptiva are the providers seen. The shoulder issue was pre-existing but was brought into disabling reality by the motor vehicle accident.\n\nThe client returned to work for the same employer due to financial strain, with the employer only scheduling him 1\u20132 days a week; he feels this is intentional to keep him from discussing the lack of proper insurance.",

      "natural_language": "The motor vehicle accident case Douglas Livers v. Allstate, identified as Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023, concerns an incident that occurred on January 19, 2023. The client is Douglas Livers. On September 17, 2024, at 1:08 PM Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Ginny Donnell of Travis, Herbert & Stempen, PLLC. In her message, she advised that her office and client were available for most of November and invited Ginny to propose starting dates that would work for both offices and the client. She stated that their understanding is that Mrs. Lewis was at fault for the incident but did not have insurance, and they would like to depose Mrs. Lewis at some point. She noted that Mrs. Lewis had not yet responded to the Complaint or the Cross-Complaint, despite service having been obtained in July. The email closed with Sarena\u2019s contact details, including her new email address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Ginny Donnell, acting as Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson of TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, had asked, in a message dated around 9:44 AM on September 17, 2024, whether counsel could provide dates when their client would be available to give a deposition in November. The message addressed Bryce Whaley and Aaron Whaley at Whaley Law Firm, and it included the law firm\u2019s address at 11507 Main Street, Jefferson Marders Building, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone number 502-245-7474 and fax 502-245-7025; website www.thslaw.co. The email was marked Privileged and Confidential, with a warning that, unless otherwise indicated or obvious, the information was attorney privileged and confidential and intended only for the named recipient. It stated that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and included the standard disclaimer that the sender or recipient acknowledges the disclaimer contained on www.thattorneys.com. The message also contained the IRS Circular 230 tax-warning language, explaining that the document does not contain all required tax disclosures and that reliance on any tax advice may be inappropriate for avoiding penalties. The forwarded message concluded with the signature of Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, including his address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022, and his email, Sarena\u2019s counterpart\u2019s contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. The matter is captioned Livers v Allstate.\n\nIn a thread related to the Livers v Allstate case, dated September 25, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Ginny Donnell with copies to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon. The subject line read \u201cRe: Livers v Allstate.\u201d In the body of the email, Sarena asked, \u201cGood afternoon Ginny, Have you had a chance to select some dates for Mr. Liver's Deposition?\u201d Her contact information was included in the signature, noting the Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the parenthetical reminder \u201c(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\u201d\n\nEarlier in the conversation, on September 17, 2024, at approximately 1:08 PM, Sarena had written to Ginny noting that The Whaley office and the client were available \u201cmost of November\u201d and inviting Ginny to pick starting dates that would work for both offices. She also stated her understanding that Mrs. Lewis was at fault for the incident but did not have insurance, and she indicated a desire to depose Mrs. Lewis as well at some point. She added that Mrs. Lewis had not yet responded to the Complaint and/or Cross-Complaint despite service in July. Sarena signed with her full title and contact details, including again the notice to use the new email address.\n\nAlso on September 17, 2024, at about 10:18 AM, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message from Ginny Donnell. The forwarded message, dated September 17, 2024 at 9:44 AM, was from Ginny Donnell and was addressed to Bryce Whaley and Aaron Whaley. In that email, Ginny requested, \u201cCan you please provide dates when your client would be available to give a deposition in November?\u201d The message included Ginny\u2019s professional affiliation as Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson at TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, with their office address at 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, and contact details: PH: (502) 245-7474 and FAX: (502) 245-7025, along with the firm\u2019s website www.thslaw.co.\n\nThe Ginny Donnell email also contained standard privilege and confidentiality notices indicating the information was attorney-privileged and confidential, intended for the named recipient, with a warning that dissemination, distribution, or copying by anyone else is prohibited; it stated that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving email from the firm. It also included IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure language to the effect that the document does not contain all required tax disclosures and that tax advice should not be relied upon, along with the firm\u2019s disclaimer that sending email does not create an attorney-client relationship. The message concluded with contact details for Aaron Whaley at Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and his phone number 502-583-4022.\n\nIn addition to the exchanges above, the original subject line and case context remained anchored to Livers v Allstate, with the matter continuing to involve the deposition scheduling for Douglas Livers in the underlying motor vehicle accident case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers.\n\nIn the matter of Livers v Allstate, a September 2024 email thread shows ongoing discussions about scheduling depositions and the issue of uninsured status. On September 17, 2024, Ginny Donnell, legal assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson of Travis, Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, sent an email to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm asking Bryce Whaley and Aaron Whaley to provide dates in November when their client would be available to testify in the Livers v Allstate case. Donnell noted that Ms. Herbert believes the plaintiff bears the burden to prove that the defendant is uninsured and suggested that they probably should hold off a little longer on scheduling the plaintiff\u2019s deposition while they awaited discovery responses. The signature block included the sending attorney\u2019s firm information and standard notices, including Privileged and Confidential statements, a disclaimer that no attorney\u2011client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and an IRS Circular 230 tax\u2011advice warning.\n\nEarlier that day, Aaron Whaley forwarded the request to Bryce Whaley and others, and Sarena Tuttle replied later that day: Our office and client are available most of November, so they could start with dates that work best for the opposing side. She indicated their understanding that Mrs. Lewis was at fault for the incident but did not have insurance, and she added that they would like to take Mrs. Lewis\u2019s deposition as well at some point, though Mrs. Lewis had not yet responded to the Complaint or Cross-Complaint despite service having been obtained in July. Tuttle\u2019s signature noted a new email address and included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky contact information.\n\nOn September 25, 2024, Tuttle followed up again, asking Ginny Donnell whether dates had been selected for Mr. Liver\u2019s deposition. The message again referenced the availability for November and included Tuttle\u2019s contact information with the new email address.\n\nFinally, on September 26, 2024 at 18:39:36 UTC, Donnell replied that, from Ms. Herbert\u2019s perspective, the plaintiff bears the burden to prove that the defendant is uninsured. Consequently, she suggested delaying the plaintiff\u2019s deposition a bit longer and informed Whaley that they were still awaiting discovery responses. The email included the same standard Privileged and Confidential notices, the no attorney\u2011client relationship disclaimer, and the IRS Circular 230 tax warning that appeared in the prior messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. This narrative follows the email correspondence regarding the Livers v. Allstate matter, with the subject line Re: Livers v Allstate. The exchange involves counsel from Travis, Herbert & Stempien, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm, and centers on deposition scheduling and issues of insurance coverage.\n\nOn September 17, 2024, at 9:44 a.m., Ginny Donnell, Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson at Travis, Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, asked Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley to provide dates when their client would be available to give a deposition in November. At 10:18 a.m. that same day, Aaron Whaley forwarded Ginny\u2019s request to the appropriate recipients. Later that day, at approximately 1:08 p.m., Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied that their office and client were available for most of November and invited the defense to propose starting dates. She also stated their understanding that Mrs. Lewis was at fault for the incident but did not have insurance, and she noted an interest in deposing Mrs. Lewis as well; however, Mrs. Lewis had not yet responded to the Complaint or Cross-Complaint, despite service having been obtained in July.\n\nOn September 25, 2024, at 12:10 p.m., Sarena followed up again, asking Ginny whether dates had been selected for Mr. Livers\u2019 deposition. The next day, September 26, 2024, at around 2:39 p.m., Ginny Donnell responded that, at this point, Ms. Herbert believed the Plaintiff bears the burden to prove the Defendant is uninsured, and therefore suggested delaying scheduling the Plaintiff\u2019s deposition a bit longer while discovery responses were still being sought.\n\nShortly thereafter, at approximately 2:54 p.m. on September 26, 2024, Sarena sent a reply detailing attachments: a Police Report and a Denial from ROOT verifying that the vehicle owner\u2019s policy was not in effect at the time of the incident. She noted that the policy for the vehicle owner was cancelled on December 29, 2022 and was not reinstated until after the incident.\n\nEarlier on September 26, 2024 at 6:56 p.m. (GMT), Ginny Donnell sent a closing email stating, \u201cYes, thank you. Ms. Herbert is working on our responses.\u201d This message also included the standard Privileged and Confidential notices, a No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer, and the IRS Circular 230 tax warning requirements, indicating that the information is attorney-privileged and confidential and that dissemination is prohibited if the reader is not the intended recipient.\n\nIn summary, the correspondence reveals ongoing negotiation over deposition timing and parties\u2019 availability, a belief by the plaintiff\u2019s side that uninsured status must be proven by the plaintiff, and documentary work confirming that the defendant\u2019s policy was not in effect at the time of the January 19, 2023, motor vehicle incident, with the policy not reinstated until after the incident. The chain also confirms that Ms. Herbert\u2019s team was still awaiting discovery responses when the latest communications occurred.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023, concerning Douglas Livers and the matter titled Livers v Allstate. In late September 2024, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, sent an email to Ginny Donnell of TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC regarding deposition dates for the Livers v Allstate matter. She noted that, despite a September 17, 2024 office email from Ginny requesting deposition dates, the Whaley Firm had not yet received a response from the opposing side. Tuttle attached a Police Report and a Denial from ROOT showing that the vehicle owner\u2019s policy was not in effect at the time of the incident: specifically, the vehicle owner\u2019s policy was canceled on December 29, 2022 and was not reinstated until after the incident. Tuttle\u2019s message also provided her contact information and included the note \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nGinny Donnell responded on September 26, 2024 at approximately 2:39 PM, stating that, at that point, Ms. Herbert believed the plaintiff had the burden to prove that the defendant was uninsured. As a result, she suggested delaying the scheduling of the plaintiff\u2019s deposition and indicated that discovery responses were still being sought. Donnell\u2019s email carried the standard privileged and confidential disclaimers common to communications from TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, and included the firm\u2019s contact information: Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson as the addressees, the firm\u2019s Louisville address at 11507 Main Street, the Jefferson Marders Building in the Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, phone number 502-245-7474, fax 502-245-7025, and the website www.thslaw.co. The message also carried the firm\u2019s \u201cPrivileged and Confidential\u201d notice, the disclaimer about no attorney-client relationship, and the IRS Circular 230 warning about tax advice disclosures.\n\nThe thread also shows a sequence of prior communications leading up to that date. On September 25, 2024, Sarena Tuttle emailed Ginny Donnell asking whether dates could be selected for Mr. Liver\u2019s deposition, noting that the office and client were available for most of November and that they would want to coordinate dates that worked for the other side as well. In a previous message, dated September 17, 2024 at 1:08 PM, Sarena stated that their office and client were available for most of November and suggested choosing starting dates that would fit the other side\u2019s schedule. She also indicated that their understanding was that Mrs. Lewis was at fault for the incident but did not have insurance, and she expressed a desire to depose Mrs. Lewis as well; however, Mrs. Lewis had not yet responded to the Complaint or Cross-Complaint despite service being obtained in July. The communications include a note that Aaron Whaley forwarded Ginny Donnell\u2019s September 17, 2024 request, which asked for deposition dates in November, and that Donnell\u2019s initial inquiry came from Ginny Donnell on the same date, asking for available dates for a deposition in November.\n\nThe email chain includes the usual forwarding and signatures. The Sept. 17 and Sept. 25 messages from Sarena Tuttle contain her Whaley Law Firm contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; with a note indicating the email address is new. The Sept. 17, 2024 message also shows the sender\u2019s designation as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager.\n\nIn sum, the communications reflect ongoing efforts to schedule depositions related to Livers v Allstate, with a focus on confirming available dates in November, seeking discovery responses, and handling issues related to uninsured status and the insured-party\u2019s timing. The most recent substantive position, as of September 26, 2024, is that Valerie W. Herbert\u2019s office believes the plaintiff bears the burden of proving the defendant\u2019s uninsured status and proposes delaying the plaintiff\u2019s deposition until those issues are resolved, while continuing to pursue any outstanding discovery responses. The attached police report and ROOT denial support the argument that the vehicle owner\u2019s policy was not in effect at the time of the incident, given the policy cancellation on December 29, 2022 and non-reinstatement until after the incident.",

The message stated that the attached Defense Counsel\u2019s Discovery Request had been previously sent to the Liverses on July 24, 2024, via USPS and email, and that they had not yet received any responses. The email emphasized that the discovery process is an imperative phase of litigation and that the responses were overdue by more than 60 days. It urged the Liverses to provide detailed answers so that the firm could finalize the discovery responses before the defense files a motion to compel or seeks penalties for the delay, and it offered to discuss any questions directly.\n\nThe email itemized seven discovery requests, asking for: 1) current occupation; 2) lost wages information; 3) whether any injuries were caused by an aggravation of a previous condition; 4) any jobs or tasks the client is unable to perform; 5) medical providers over the past 15 years; 6) employers over the last 10 years; and 7) any copies of repair bills or estimates. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, whose title is Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. The contact numbers listed were D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, with a direct email address of Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and a note indicating this is the new email address.\n\nA separate morning communication to Douglas followed.

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. In the matter of Douglas Livers v. Allstate, the Whaley Law Firm correspondence on November 20, 2024 reflects ongoing discovery issues and deposition scheduling for the client, Mr. Douglas Livers.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Ginny Donnell regarding the case. She noted that they still had not received your client\u2019s responses to the discovery requests propounded to Allstate on July 23, 2024. Referring to a September conversation in which Mrs. Valerie W. Herbert asked them to \u201cprove\u201d that Defendant Lewis was uninsured, Tuttle stated that they had provided two denial letters showing Mrs. Lewis\u2019s coverage had lapsed prior to the date of the incident and was not reinstated until after that date. She added that, at that time, they must await Allstate\u2019s response to the Plaintiff\u2019s first set of interrogatories before proceeding with deposition scheduling, and she requested any update on when those responses could be anticipated. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, who identified herself as a Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting that this is a new email address.\n\nEarlier that same day, November 20, 2024, at 10:42?AM, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message chain. The forwarded message originated with Ginny Donnell, who dated the message as November 20, 2024 at 10:26?AM and addressed it to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon. In her message, Donnell wrote: \u201cCounsel, I am following up on Valerie\u2019s email. Could you please provide dates for the deposition of Mr. Livers? Thank you.\u201d She signed as Ginny Donnell, Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson, at TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, located at 11507 Main Street, Jefferson Marders Building, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243. She provided the firm\u2019s phone number, (502) 245-7474, and fax number, (502) 245-7025, and listed the website www.thslaw.co.\n\nThe email chain included standard privileged and confidential notices. It stated that, unless otherwise indicated or obvious from the nature of the transmission, the information in the email was attorney privileged and confidential, intended for the named recipient, and that dissemination, distribution, or copying to others was strictly prohibited. If received in error or if the reader was not the intended recipient, the recipient was to notify the sender by telephone and delete the message. It also carried the disclaimer that there is no attorney\u2013client relationship created by sending or receiving the email. The message further contained the firm\u2019s warning that sending email does not establish an attorney\u2013client relationship with the recipient, and that this firm acknowledges the disclaimer at www.thattorneys.com.\n\nAdditionally, the message included a tax-related disclaimer required by the IRS under Circular 230. It warned that, because the document does not contain all of the required disclosures, the recipient should not rely on any tax advice contained therein to avoid penalties, nor may any portion of the document be used in marketing or promotional materials.\n\nThe message concluded with the signature of Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the contact number 502-583-4022. The email chain also reflects the involvement of Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson of TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, in the underlying deposition scheduling discussions.",

Allstate, et al., in Jefferson Circuit Court, captioned as such with the case number 24-CI-04424.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, communications occurred among counsel regarding discovery and deposition dates. At 1:39 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Valerie Herbert and Ginny Donnell with a cc to the Filevine project email DouglasLiversMVAZ4299598@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The subject was Douglas Livers v. Allstate, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-04424). In that message, he advised that Plaintiff\u2019s Supplemental Discovery Responses, along with the associated notice filed that day, were attached. He noted that the responses had been verified by Mr. Livers on the last page and invited any questions.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 1:42 PM, Ginny Donnell, Legal Assistant to Valerie W. Herbert and Jennifer A. Peterson of TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, replied. She asked for deposition dates: \u201cThank you. Are you able to provide dates for his deposition?\u201d Her signature identified her as the Legal Assistant, with the firm\u2019s contact information: TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN, PLLC, 11507 Main Street, Jefferson Marders Building, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; website www.thslaw.co. The email included standard privilege and confidentiality notices, stating the information was attorney-client privileged and confidential and intended only for the named recipient; dissemination, distribution, or copying was prohibited if received in error. It also contained a statement that no attorney\u2011client relationship is created by sending or receiving the message, and a separate IRS Circular 230 tax disclaimer about tax advice and compliance with tax regulations. An image placeholder noted that an image had been removed by the sender.\n\nAt 2:23 PM on December 2, 2024, Bryce Koon replied to counsel with: \u201cI will get back to you with deposition dates shortly.\u201d He reaffirmed his contact details and The Whaley Law Firm information in his signature, alongside the firm\u2019s Louisville address and phone and fax numbers.\n\nFor reference, The Whaley Law Firm is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207.

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Douglas Livers v. Allstate (Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023), the deposition scheduling process generated a brief but important email exchange in December 2024 between The Whaley Law Firm and the office of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys. The Whaley Law Firm represents Douglas Livers, and the deposition notice concerns Mr. Livers as the client.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, at about 3:50 PM, Sarena Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, sent an email to Ginny Donnell with copies to Aaron Whaley, Bryce Koon, and Valerie Herbert, regarding the deposition scheduling for Douglas Livers. In that message, she noted that the CourtNet notification indicated the opposing side had filed a Notice to Take Deposition of their client for January 31, 2025. She explained that she had not been CC\u2019d on the prior scheduling emails and that the January 31 date would not work for their office. She requested that the opposing side provide new dates on which they are available for the deposition.\n\nLater that same day, Valerie Herbert of Travis, Herbert & Stempien replied. Her message stated that she could be available on February 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 14, and 18. She asked to be updated to confirm the deposition, and she offered to adjust if those dates did not work by proposing other dates. Her contact information was provided as Valerie W. Herbert of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys, with an office at 11507 Main Street in the Middletown Historic District of Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-245-7474 and fax 502-245-7025. The reply included the standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality notices, as well as disclaimers about no attorney-client relationship, and an IRS Circular 230 tax disclaimer, along with typical disclaimers about email communications and confidentiality.\n\nThis email chain also contains the background header information for the thread, including the subject \u201cDouglas Livers v Allstate - Deposition Scheduling,\u201d and the sender/recipient details. The thread reflects a prior message from Sarena Tuttle dated December 19, 2024 at 3:50 PM to Ginny Donnell and copied to Aaron Whaley, Bryce Koon, and Valerie Herbert, with the subject noted above. In that earlier note, Sarena explained that a CourtNet notification had been received indicating a Notice to Take Deposition for January 31, 2025, and reiterated that the date did not work for their office, asking for new dates when the other side was available.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, at 9:37 AM, Sarena Tuttle followed up with a more definitive response to Valerie Herbert. She expressed appreciation for the quick reply and stated that the firm\u2019s best available date is February 12. They could maintain a 10:00 a.m. start time, noted that Valerie\u2019s office is a beautiful setting, and she intended to inform Mr. Livers that the date is confirmed. She closed by thanking Valerie and wishing happy holidays. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.

He stated that they were open to informal discussions or mediation if needed and asked Valarie whether she would like him to resend the demand previously submitted to the adjuster. He noted openness to discuss and asked for a response. He signed as W.

The message was sent with a disclaimer that the email had been scanned for spam and viruses by Proofpoint Essentials, with an option to report the email as spam.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on February 24, 2025, Bryce\u2019s message included the subject referenced above and was followed by the customary privilege notice and spam-scanning disclosure.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, at 3:59 PM, Valerie Herbert replied. She stated that she would review her file and then give Bryce a call to discuss. The reply concluded with \u201cThanks Valerie.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 10:58:08 AM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon sent another follow-up message: \u201cGood morning counsel, Just wanted to circle back on this one.

The same attorney-client privilege notice appeared in this message as well.\n\nThis sequence reflects continued negotiation efforts for the Livers v. Allstate matter, with invitations to discuss either informally or by mediation, and a willingness to resend the prior demand to the adjuster if requested. The chain documents the parties\u2019 attention to possible settlement discussions and maintains the formalities typical of a case-file email correspondence.",

He asked Valerie to let him know if she would like him to resend the demand previously submitted to the adjuster, and he indicated he looked forward to her response. The message was sent from Bryce Koon to Valerie Herbert, with Ginny Donnell and Sarena Tuttle cc\u2019d, along with the Douglas Livers MVA 1/19/2023 Filevine project email address, DouglasLiversMVAZ4299598@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.

      "natural_language": "This case is Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023, concerning the client Douglas Livers in the matter Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson 24-CI-004424). The following notes summarize a sequence of emails between counsel about the status of mediation and negotiations, beginning with an exchange in February 2025 and continuing through March 2025.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Valerie Herbert, requesting to revisit negotiations to resolve the matter. He stated that his office was open to informal discussions or mediation if needed and asked Valerie to let him know if she would like him to resend the demand previously submitted to the adjuster; otherwise, he looked forward to a response. Bryce\u2019s message included his contact details and a standard confidentiality disclaimer. The thread also shows copies to Ginny Donnell, Sarena Tuttle, and a Filevine project email address related to Douglas Livers MVA 1/19/2023.\n\nValerie Herbert replied on March 3, 2025. In that message, she told Bryce that she would review her file and then give him a call to discuss. Her signature identified her as Valerie W. Herbert of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys, located at 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, with phone and fax numbers provided. The email signature block included the customary attorney-privileged and confidential information notice, stating that the information is intended for the named recipient only and that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving email, along with the firm\u2019s disclaimer and related IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure language. The message also contained the standard note indicating the email was scanned for spam and viruses by Proofpoint Essentials.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a reply to Valerie, titled \u201cRe: Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson 24-CI-004424)\u201d and addressed to Valerie with Ginny Donnell and Sarena Tuttle CC\u2019d, as well as the Douglas Livers MVA Filevine Project email address. In his short reply, Bryce wrote, \u201cGood morning counsel, Just wanted to circle back on this one.\u201d His signature block again provided The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information. The message carried the same standard confidentiality and privilege notices as the prior communications, including the disclaimer that the email is intended only for the named recipient and that it may contain privileged information, along with the caution not to share if received in error.\n\nValerie\u2019s March 18, 2025 message to Bryce reiterated the earlier content: she had reached out to her adjuster about two weeks prior after her last email to determine whether the adjuster believed there was enough information to schedule mediation, but she had not yet heard back. Valerie stated she would follow up with Bryce as soon as she spoke with the adjuster. Her signature block again identified her as Valerie W. Herbert of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys, with the same office address and contact details, and the same attorney-privilege and confidentiality notices and IRS Circular 230 disclosures.\n\nThe thread also includes references to the attached images in the email signatures and the standard disclaimers found in these communications. In addition, it shows the ongoing confidentiality language, the absence of an established attorney-client relationship by email, and the routine notices commonly included with such correspondence, as well as a note that the emails were scanned for spam and viruses by Proofpoint Essentials.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. This file concerns the motor vehicle accident case Livers v. Allstate, Jefferson County, case number 24-CI-004424, with the incident date referenced as January 19, 2023.\n\nIn a series of email exchanges during 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Valerie W. Herbert, an attorney with Travis, Herbert & Stempien, discussed potential settlement discussions for the case. The subject line across these exchanges was Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson 24-CI-004424). Bryce\u2019s messages included the file\u2019s Filevine project email address, DouglasLiversMVAZ4299598@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and the correspondence also cc\u2019d Ginny Donnell and the Filevine project contact for the Livers matter.\n\nThe first outreach in the chain occurred on February 24, 2025, when Bryce emailed Valerie to inquire whether her office was interested in revisiting negotiations to resolve the matter. He stated that his office was open to informal discussions or mediation if needed and asked Valerie to let him know if he should resend the demand previously submitted to the adjuster. He closed with appreciation for a response and provided his firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nValerie responded on March 3, 2025, telling Bryce that she would review her file and then give him a call to discuss.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Bryce sent another follow-up message to Valerie, simply stating that he wanted to circle back on the matter. He again signed with his standard contact information and the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer that accompanies such emails.\n\nLater that same day, Valerie replied. She explained that she had reached out to her adjuster about two weeks prior after her last email to discuss whether the adjuster believed there was enough information to schedule mediation now. Valerie noted that she had not heard back from the adjuster and said she would follow up with Bryce as soon as she spoke with her.\n\nFinally, on April 2, 2025, Bryce sent a concluding follow-up: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just following up. Any update is appreciated.\u201d He again signed his name, provided his firm\u2019s contact information, and included the standard attorney-client privilege notice.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications were accompanied by the usual confidentiality and privilege notices common to attorney correspondence, and the thread includes references to the case file\u2019s Filevine project email address and the cc\u2019d participants, including Ginny Donnell and the Douglas Livers MVA project address. The core facts preserved in these notes are that the parties were attempting to revisit settlement discussions, that Valerie intended to consult with her adjuster about scheduling mediation, and that as of April 2, 2025 there had been no communicated update from the adjuster.",

Allstate in Jefferson County (case number 24-CI-004424), arising from a motor vehicle accident on January 19, 2023. In 2025, the counsel email communications reflect attempts to revisit settlement discussions and to move forward with discovery and mediation, depending on the assignment of a new adjuster.\n\nOn February 24, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Valerie Herbert, Esq., of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys, to inquire whether her office was interested in revisiting negotiations to resolve the matter. He stated they were open to informal discussions or mediation if needed and asked Valerie to let him know if she would like him to resend the demand previously submitted to the adjuster; otherwise, he awaited her response. The message included the standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality notice typical for such emails.\n\nValerie Herbert replied on March 3, 2025, indicating she would review her file and then call Bryce to discuss the matter.\n\nLater, on March 18, 2025, Bryce followed up again, sending a brief note stating, \u201cGood morning counsel, just wanted to circle back on this one.\u201d Valerie responded later that day, explaining that she had reached out to her adjuster about two weeks prior after her last email to determine whether the adjuster thought there was enough information to schedule mediation, but she had not yet heard back. She said she would follow up with Bryce as soon as she spoke with the adjuster.\n\nThere is another later communication dated April 21, 2025, in which Valerie advised Bryce that she had been told the adjuster working on the case with her had left Allstate, though she could not confirm this information yet. She stated that she wanted to mediate the case but could not move forward until a new adjuster was assigned. In the meantime, she planned to conduct some basic discovery and hoped to move ahead in 60 to 90 days. This message, like the others, included the standard attorney-privileged and confidential notices and disclaimers about attorney-client relationship and related IRS Circular 230 tax disclosures.\n\nValerie Herbert\u2019s contact information appears in the signatures for the emails: TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN ATTORNEYS, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; email Vherbert@thattorneys.com.

The chain of communications confirms ongoing but unsettled efforts to schedule mediation and to progress discovery in a case concerning a 2023 motor vehicle accident, with the practical impediment being the assignment and status of the case\u2019s adjuster at Allstate.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes a sequence of email communications regarding the case Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson 24-CI-004424) for client Douglas Livers, filed under the project name Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. The matter involves counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and the defense counsel at Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys. The July 7, 2025 email from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) to Valerie Herbert (and copied others, including Ginny Donnell and the Filevine project address DouglasLiversMVAZ4299598@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) began the latest follow-up, stating simply: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one. Any update appreciated.\u201d The email included the firm\u2019s standard confidentiality and privilege disclaimer, noting it was intended only for the named recipient and that no waiver of privilege should be assumed if received in error.\n\nEarlier messages in the chain show ongoing discussions about mediation and the status of the adjuster handling the case. On April 21, 2025, Valerie Herbert of Travis, Herbert & Stempien Attorneys (11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; vherbert@thattorneys.com) wrote that she had been told the adjuster working on the case had left Allstate, but she had not yet confirmed that information. She stated an intention to mediate the case but could not move forward until a new adjuster was assigned. In the meantime, she planned to conduct basic discovery and expressed hope that they could move ahead in 60 to 90 days. Her email included the standard attorney-privilege and confidential information notices, a no-attorney-client-relationship disclaimer, and other disclosures typical of correspondence from that firm.\n\nIn a prior exchange dated March 18, 2025, Valerie sent a message to Bryce Koon (with Ginny Donnell, Sarena Tuttle, and the Douglas Livers Filevine project address CC\u2019d) regarding the same matter. In that message, she acknowledged Bryce\u2019s email and said she had reached out to her adjuster about two weeks earlier after her last email to discuss whether the adjuster thought there was enough information to schedule mediation. Valerie stated she had not yet heard back from the adjuster and would follow up as soon as she spoke with her. This email also contained the standard attorney-privilege and confidential notices, the explicit disclaimer about no attorney-client relationship, and the Circular 230 tax-disclosure warnings.\n\nEarlier still, on the same day (March 18, 2025) at 10:58 AM, Bryce had replied to Valerie with a brief note: \u201cGood morning counsel, Just wanted to circle back on this one.\u201d His message, like the others, was accompanied by the Whaley Law Firm signature block and the same confidentiality and privilege disclosures.\n\nAcross these communications, the central issues were consistent: confirming whether a new adjuster had been assigned so mediation could proceed, and whether mediation could be scheduled given the status of the adjuster and the ongoing discovery. The parties referenced a potential 60- to 90-day horizon for movement if the adjuster situation could be resolved and sufficient information gathered for mediation. The messages also repeatedly included standard privilege and confidentiality warnings and, in the March 18, 2025 emails, explicit notes that no attorney-client relationship is created by email exchanges.\n\nIn sum, the record shows a concerted but stalled effort to advance Livers v. Allstate toward mediation, contingent on confirmation of a new adjuster and the completion of basic discovery, with active follow-ups from both sides in March 2025 and a subsequent follow-up request from Bryce Koon in July 2025.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023. Client: Douglas Livers. This note concerns the Livers v. Allstate matter in Jefferson County (case number 24-CI-004424), arising from a motor vehicle accident on January 19, 2023. The current communication chain centers on mediation timing and adjuster assignment, with multiple emails exchanged between counsel.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, at 10:06:28 a.m. Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Valerie Herbert, with Ginny Donnell copied and Douglas Livers MVA 1/19/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address included in the cc. The subject of the note was \u201cRe: Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson 24-CI-004424).\u201d In the body, Counsel stated that he was following up on the matter and thanked Valerie. His contact details were provided: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 365-5043; fax (502) 237-3207. The note also included the standard confidentiality and privilege disclaimer typical of electronic attorney correspondence, indicating that the message was intended only for the named recipient, that it may contain attorney-client privileged information, and instructions if the message was received in error. Additional disclaimers indicated that no waiver of privilege was intended and that the content should not be shared beyond the intended recipient.\n\nThis message followed a prior chain of emails. On July 7, 2025, Bryce Koon wrote to counsel with a concise follow-up: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one. Any update appreciated.\u201d He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., with the same firm address and contact information as above, and the email carried the same standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nEarlier in the year, Valerie Herbert, of TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN ATTORNEYS, had provided an update regarding mediation prospects. On April 21, 2025 at 10:10 a.m. (Eastern), Valerie wrote that she had been told the adjuster working on the case with her had left Allstate, though she had not yet been able to confirm this definitively. She stated her intention to mediate the case but explained that she could not move forward until a new adjuster was assigned. In the meantime, she planned to conduct some basic discovery and anticipated progress within 60 to 90 days. Valerie included her firm\u2019s contact information: TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN ATTORNEYS, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone (502) 245-7474; fax (502) 245-7025; email Vherbert@thattorneys.com. As with the other messages, the email contained extensive attorney-confidential-disclaimer language: that the information is attorney-privileged and confidential for the intended recipient, a reminder that the sender represents that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving the email, and that recipients should delete the message if it was received in error. The message also included the standard IRS Circular 230 warning about potential tax-related disclosures.\n\nAdditionally, Valerie\u2019s March 18, 2025 email to Bryce Koon, dated 1:40 p.m., is part of the same thread. In that message, Valerie thanked Bryce for his prior email and reported that she had reached out to her adjuster about two weeks earlier to assess whether there was enough information to schedule mediation, but she had not heard back from the adjuster yet. She pledged to follow up as soon as she spoke with her, and she again provided her contact information: Valerie W. Herbert, TRAVIS, HERBERT & STEMPIEN ATTORNEYS, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; phone (502) 245-7474; fax (502) 245-7025; email Vherbert@thattorneys.com. This March 18 email also carried the same confidentiality and privilege notices, a no-attorney-client-relationship disclaimer, and the IRS Circular 230 tax-disclosure language.\n\nIn sum, the note records a sequence of communications from March through July 2025 between counsel for the plaintiff (Douglas Livers) and counsel for Allstate, focused on whether mediation could proceed given an unsettled adjuster assignment. Valerie Herbert indicated in March that she had not yet received a response from her adjuster after reaching out about mediation, and she planned to run basic discovery with an expected timeline of 60 to 90 days. In April, she reiterated that the adjuster had left Allstate and that mediation could not proceed without a new adjuster, while continuing discovery. Bryce Koon followed up in July with inquiries about any updates, and a final follow-up message from Bryce on July 22, 2025, reaffirmed the request for an update. All communications included their respective firm contact information and the customary confidentiality and privilege notices, along with disclosures related to attorney-client relationships and, in at least one email, the IRS Circular 230 warning. The case remains identified as Livers v. Allstate (Jefferson County, 24-CI-004424), with the client Douglas Livers and the related motor vehicle accident filing referenced as MVA 1/19/2023 and associated with the Filevine project email address listed in the cc field.",

      "natural_language": "The case Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023 involves client Douglas Livers. The file organization task has been completed, with a comprehensive reorganization of the case files using an eight-bucket system and a parallel processing workflow.\n\nWork performed and results: A total of 264 files were successfully organized and renamed, representing 92% completion. Files were categorized into the following buckets: Medical Records (80+ files), Litigation (85 files), Insurance (27 files), Lien (20 files), Client (20 files), Investigation (7 files), and Negotiation Settlement (9 files). All organized files follow the standardized naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD - Client Name - Category - Originator - Description. Medical records were organized by provider, specifically Aptiva Health, Dixie Injury & Rehab, and Aptiva Health Imaging. Insurance files were organized by type and carrier, including BI/Root Insurance, PIP/Allstate, and UIM/Allstate. Lien files were organized under Kentucky Child Support Enforcement. A quality review was completed with a 1.5% error rate, resulting in 3 errors corrected.\n\nOutstanding items: 23 files remain in the root directory (not included in the initial analysis phase). Additionally, 15 court notification emails need renaming to the standard format, and 5 image files in the Review_Needed folder require manual categorization.\n\nKey findings from file review: There is a significant child support lien for $46,260.51, based on an Order to Withhold and Deliver dated 8/2/2024. An Allstate Reservation of Rights letter dated 8/30/2025 cites coverage exclusions for employee use and workers' compensation. A client deposition was completed on 2/12/2025. Active mediation scheduling discussions are ongoing with defense counsel Valerie Herbert. Root Insurance BI coverage was denied due to the policy having lapsed at the time of the accident.\n\nReports Generated: The following reports were produced as part of the process: File inventory (Reports/file_inventory_Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023.md), Reorganization map (Reports/file_reorganization_map_Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023.md), Quality review (Reports/quality_review_summary_Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023.md), and Final summary (Reports/reorganization_summary_Douglas-Livers-MVA-1-19-2023.md).\n\nNext steps:\n1.
