      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. Client: Jerome Hedinger.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm sent a reminder email to Jerome Hedinger regarding his case. The message, titled \u201cReminder: Thank you for Choosing The Whaley Law Firm,\u201d was from Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, and was addressed to Jerome Hedinger. In the email, Sarena thanked him for the update and information and asked him to complete the documents attached to the DocuSign Notice so that the firm could proceed with his case. She directed that any documents he had should be forwarded directly to her email, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and not as a reply to the DocuSign Notification. For questions, she provided contact options: (502) 583-4022 ext 104 or via email at Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The email included her full signature with the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and listed D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104 as contact numbers, along with the note to use the new email address.\n\nLater that same day, around 1:21 PM (times noted with a question mark in the source), Jerome Hedinger replied. He apologized for having gone dark on the matter and explained that the delay was his issue. He stated that he had finally learned the dog owner/tenant\u2019s name\u2014Draylen Round\u2014and that he had obtained records from Baptist and the veterinarian for Rory. He said he would download these records tonight and send them in Word format. He also mentioned receiving a call from the prosecutor who had been handling the day of the case on the day of sentencing. He had not heard back from that prosecutor, but he noted that something had happened to that person. The message was signed by Jerry Hedinger.\n\nEarlier, on February 12, 2024, at around 3:50 AM, Aaron Whaley sent a DocuSign notification to review and sign a document. The message included a header indicating \u201cREVIEW DOCUMENT\u201d and instructed the recipient to \u201cPlease complete the attached packet for legal representation for your claims arising out of a Premise Liability incident.\u201d It directed the recipient to contact Aaron Whaley at STuttle.wlf@Gmail.com and to call (502) 583-4022 if there were questions, concluding with \u201cWe look forward to working with you.\u201d The email carried the DocuSign branding and warned not to share the email, link, or access code with others. An alternate signing method was provided: visit DocuSign.com, click \u201cAccess Documents,\u201d and enter the security code: 4FA7C76180084F9A99902DDA69F96D987. The message explained that it contained a secure link to DocuSign, and included the standard DocuSign boilerplate about electronic signing being safe, secure, and legally binding. It also stated: \u201cQuestions about the Document? If you need to modify the document or have questions about the details in the document, please reach out to the sender by emailing them directly.\u201d Additional notes invited the recipient to \u201cStop receiving this email\u201d or to read more about \u201cDeclining to sign\u201d and \u201cManaging notifications,\u201d and offered help via the DocuSign Help Center if signing problems arose. The message encouraged downloading the DocuSign App and closed with a reminder that it was sent by Aaron Whaley using the DocuSign Electronic Signature Service, with the option to request that emails from this sender be stopped.",

On March 14, 2024 at 11:07 p.m. Eastern Time, Jerome Hedinger wrote to Aaron Whaley, with no CCs listed. In his message, Jerry explained that he had been slow to act, but that his neighbor\u2014who keeps a pit bull and is a convicted felon\u2014received only a light punishment. He stated that the dog is still present and aggressive. He indicated that he has prepared all notes and planned to drop them off, along with the dog owner\u2019s name, phone number, and the prosecutor who allowed the dog to remain. He described an incident from that night in which the pit bull was outside and charged at him again. While expressing that he loves animals, he conveyed a growing fear that the dog could escape again. The message conveyed a desire for prompt, forceful action (\u201cblood now\u201d). He signed the message as Jerry Hedinger and provided his contact number: 502-417-2550.\n\nEarlier, on February 12, 2024, at approximately 1:21 p.m., Jerome Hedinger sent a follow-up note to Aaron Whaley. In this message, he apologized for going dark and attributed the lapse to his own issue. He reported that he had learned the dog owner/tenant\u2019s name, Draylen Round, and that he had obtained records from Baptist and veterinary records for a dog named Rory. He said he would download those records that night and send them in a Word document. He also mentioned receiving a call from the prosecutor who handled the case on the day of sentencing, but that he had never heard back; he suggested that something may have happened to the prosecutor.\n\nAlso on February 12, 2024, at 3:50 a.m., Aaron Whaley sent a message via DocuSign to Dr. Hedinger. This message activated an envelope for review and signing, inviting him to complete the attached packet for legal representation regarding his claims arising out of a Premise Liability incident. The message provided contact details for the law firm: (502) 583-4022, and stated that they looked forward to working with him.

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023\nClient: Jerome Hedinger\n\nRe: New submission from Contact Us\n\nIn this matter, the Whaley Law Firm represents Mr. Jerome Hedinger in a personal injury (dog bite) case. On May 24, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Dr. William H. Haney, M.D., at his office. The message stated that their office had previously submitted a Medical Records & Billing Request for Mr. Hedinger on March 19, 2024 and had not yet received a response. It noted that attempts to reach the Fairfax office or the Nanz Avenue office had resulted in phones that \"state[d] 'The call did not go through. Please try your call again later.'\" Sarena asked that someone from the Records & Billing Department contact them to discuss the matter. Her contact details were provided: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (with a note indicating a new email address). The message also listed the firm\u2019s name, Sarena\u2019s role, and the physician involved, highlighting that the office represents Mr. Hedinger for the dog bite personal injury.\n\nSubsequently, Dr. Haney\u2019s office replied in a series of messages. On May 30, 2024, at 9:21 AM, Dr. Haney wrote that he was sorry for the late reply and that he did have the request, but as the office manager he had many responsibilities and requests for medical records. He said he would try to get to the request next week and apologized for any inconvenience. Monica Crume, LPN, Office Manager, signed the message and provided contact information: 502-897-6568.\n\nLater that same morning, at 9:45 AM, Sarena responded again, emphasizing that while they understood people have many responsibilities, their client had been injured and was awaiting compensation. She pointed out that without the records they could not move forward with the recovery for Mr. Hedinger. She reminded Dr. Haney that, in Kentucky, medical providers are required to respond to and fulfill record requests within 30 days, and noted that this request was over 60 days old and delaying the claim. She requested the records and bills be forwarded promptly and provided direct contact details for follow-up: (502) 583-4022 ext 104 or Bryce at Ext 114, and re-stated her email address.\n\nEarlier that morning, at 11:13 AM, Dr. Haney sent another message noting that he had left Sarena a voicemail and that he was reviewing Hedinger\u2019s chart. He stated that they had never seen Mr. Hedinger for any dog bites and did not have any records from any ER/urgent care indicating such treatment. He asked Sarena to call him when she had a chance to discuss the matter further. His message was signed by Monica Crume, LPN, Office Manager, with contact information: 502-897-6568.\n\nShortly after, at 11:40 AM, another message from Dr. Haney stated, \u201cSenera, I decided to look into the Baptist system and I found this report. So I thought I would send it to you since you were having issues getting it. I will have the letter to you today once completed. Thank you.\u201d This message was also attributed to Monica Crume.\n\nFinally, at 12:14 PM on May 30, 2024, the Dr. Haney Office sent a closing note to Sarena: \u201cSarena, See if this will work for you. you\u2019re welcome!!\u201d The thread is titled \u201cRe: New submission from Contact Us\u201d and originates from Dr. Haney Office (haneyoffice@ultmd.com) to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com).\n\nIn summary, the file documents a dog-bite personal injury case for Jerome Hedinger, with The Whaley Law Firm requesting Mr. Hedinger\u2019s medical records and bills first submitted on March 19, 2024. The communications reveal persistent delays and a lack of response from the Fairfax and Nanz Avenue offices, repeated assurances from Dr. Haney\u2019s team about locating or obtaining the records (including a search of the Baptist system), and reminders about Kentucky\u2019s 30-day record-response requirements, noting that the request had exceeded 60 days without fulfillment. The chain concludes with a courtesy confirmation from Dr. Haney\u2019s office indicating that the materials or letter were being pursued for delivery.",

Re: 8911611948 Hedinger Aetna Bill.\n\nIn a June 13, 2024 email, Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sarena Tuttle to check on the progress of the Demand Draft for the 8911611948 Hedinger Aetna Bill and asked if anything else was needed. He signed the message as Jerry Hedinger.\n\nEarlier correspondence shows the following sequence. On May 31, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied that she had received the required items the previous day toward the end of the day and had forwarded everything to Bryce to have the Demand Draft drafted. She stated she would update Jerome as soon as the Demand Draft went out. Her signature identified her as Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with contact details including the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, direct line 502-357-9971, main line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and her email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting that it was her new email address.\n\nPrior to that, on May 30, 2024, at 4:28 PM, Jerome Hedinger asked, \u201cDid we get you Rory\u2019s vet bills?\u201d In the same day, at 2:16 PM, Sarena responded, \u201cThank you so much Jerry, this is perfect. I did also receive the photos of the fence which will be helpful as well. I will get all of this over to Aaron & Bryce right now and hopefully get a Demand out by the end of the next week.\u201d Her message was signed with the same Whaley Law Firm details and the note about the new email address.\n\nEarlier still, at 1:39 PM on May 30, 2024, Jerome Hedinger had written, \u201cSarena this is from Aetna. Does this help you,\u201d followed by his signature, \u201cJerry Hedinger.\u201d The thread thus shows that the correspondence revolved around assembling items for a Demand Draft related to the Aetna bill, including Rory\u2019s vet bills and photos of a fence, with plans to forward materials to Aaron and Bryce to expedite the draft.\n\nOverall, the sequence indicates that the team was collecting necessary documents from the client, routing them to Bryce and Aaron for drafting, and coordinating the timeline to issue the Demand Draft, with updates and confirmations exchanged across these messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. Client: Jerome Hedinger. Re: 8911611948 Hedinger Aetna Bill.\n\nThe communications involve Jerome Hedinger and The Whaley Law Firm regarding a demand related to an Aetna bill in a case that appears to be tracked under the Jerome Hedinger premises file. On June 19, 2024, Jerome emailed Sarena Tuttle asking what had been requested on the demand notice, inquiring, \u201cHey Sarena, what did we ask for on the demand notice? Just curious.\u201d\n\nLooking back through the chain, on June 13, 2024, at approximately 3:46 PM, Jerome Hedinger replied to Sarena with a \u201cThanks Sarena!\u201d Sarena had earlier that day indicated they had received the Certified Medical Records and Billing from Baptist Health, and that Bryce was applying the final touches to the demand and that it should go out that day or first thing the next morning. She explained that once the Demand is sent, the at-fault insurer would have 30-45 days to review the information and provide a response, though the Adjuster could respond at any time, and they would update Jerome as soon as they heard back to discuss the response in detail. Sarena also invited Jerome to contact them directly with any questions. Her signature notes she is a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address and contact details, and an indication to note her new email address at Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier on June 13, 2024, at 3:28 AM, Jerome had asked Sarena for progress on the Demand Draft and whether anything else was needed. Then on June 13, 2024, at 9:56 AM, Sarena reiterated the update about receiving the medical records and billing, Bryce working on the final demand, and the expected timing for sending the demand, along with the 30- to 45-day review period by the at-fault insurer and the possibility of an earlier response by the Adjuster, adding that they would keep Jerome updated and inviting any questions.\n\nThe thread also shows ongoing coordination in late May. On May 30, 2024, at 1:39 PM, Jerome wrote to Sarena asking if the attached material from Aetna would help. Sarena responded later that day (2:16 PM), thanking him and saying she had also received photos of the fence, which would be helpful. She stated she would forward everything to Aaron and Bryce and hoped to get a Demand out by the end of the next week. Later that same day, on May 30 at 4:28 PM, Jerome asked whether Rory\u2019s vet bills had been obtained. In response, Sarena confirmed the request and noted that she had received Rory\u2019s vet bills and the fence photos, that she would forward everything to Aaron and Bryce, and that she aimed to have a Demand drafted by the end of the following week. The following day, May 31, 2024, at 9:44 AM, Sarena wrote that she had received the materials toward the end of the previous day and had sent everything to Bryce to draft the Demand, promising to update Jerome as soon as the Demand went out.\n\nIn summary, the case chronology shows Jerome Hedinger communicating with Sarena Tuttle about compiling and drafting a demand related to the 8911611948 Hedinger Aetna Bill, with material being gathered from Aetna and Baptist Health (as well as associated vet bills and fence photos), tasks delegated to Bryce and Aaron for drafting, and a planned timeline indicating the Demand would be sent within days of mid-June 2024, with the at-fault insurer given 30-45 days to respond, and the team committing to keep Jerome updated throughout the process.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger \u2013 Hedinger Aetna Bill (8911611948)  \nClient: Jerome Hedinger\n\nIn late May 2024, the Whaley Law Firm began coordinating the preparation of a demand related to an Aetna bill for Jerome Hedinger. Sarena Tuttle, the firm\u2019s litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, asked Bryce to draft the demand after receiving Rory\u2019s veterinary bills and photos of a fence, which Jerome had provided. On May 30, 2024 at 1:39 PM, Jerome asked Sarena if the materials \u201cthis is from Aetna\u201d would help her. The following message at 2:16 PM confirmed: \u201cThank you so much Jerry, This is perfect. I did also receive the photos of the fence which will be helpful as well. I will get all of this over to Aaron & Bryce right now and hopefully get a Demand out by the end of the next week.\u201d Later that afternoon, at 4:28 PM, Jerome followed up asking, \u201cDid we get you Rory\u2019s vet bills?\u201d\n\nBy May 31, 2024 at 9:44 AM, Sarena replied that she had received the items the previous day toward the end of the day and had sent everything to Bryce to have the Demand drafted, promising to update Jerome as soon as it went out.\n\nThe process continued into June. On June 13, 2024 at 3:28 AM, Jerome checked in again, asking, \u201cHi Sarena, just checking in on the progress for the Demand Draft. Do you need anything else?\u201d Later that day, at 9:56 AM, Sarena reported that they had received Certified Medical Records and Billing from Baptist Health and that Bryce was finishing the demand, which should go out that day or first thing the next day. She noted that once the Demand is sent, the at-fault insurer would have 30-45 days to review the information and provide a response, though the Adjuster could respond at any time; they would update Jerome as soon as any response was received and would discuss it in detail. She also encouraged Jerome to contact them with any questions.\n\nOn Monday, June 24, 2024 at about 12:30 PM, Sarena apologized for being out of the office the prior week due to a cremation ceremony and said she would check with Bryce about the Demand value and that one of them would reach out as soon as possible.\n\nFinally, on Wednesday, June 26, 2024 at 11:43 AM, Sarena sent an update to Jerome: Bryce had advised that the Demand Amount was $25,000.00. She reminded Jerome that the Demand Amount is merely a starting point for negotiations and that the Adjuster would have 30-45 days to respond, with the expectation of a lowball offer at first as part of standard negotiation strategy. She also noted that Bryce or Aaron would contact him as soon as a response was received to discuss the negotiation process in more detail, and she encouraged him to reach out with any questions.\n\nSignature details included Sarena M. Tuttle\u2019s role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and contact numbers (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104) and her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com). The chain of communications shows ongoing collection of medical records, billing, and additional supporting documents, the drafting and issuance of the Demand, and the expected negotiation process with the insurer.",

This matter was discussed in a series of email communications from The Whaley Law Firm, with Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, coordinating with Jerome Hedinger and other firm staff.\n\nOn June 24, 2024, Sarena Tuttle emailed Jerry Hedinger to address the 8911611948 Hedinger Aetna bill. She apologized for being out of the office the previous week due to a cremation ceremony and said she would check in with Bryce about the demand value, and that one of them would reach out as soon as possible. In her signature she listed her title, the firm\u2019s contact information, and noted her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the firm address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on June 19, 2024, Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sarena asking what was requested for the demand notice, inquiring, \u201cHey Sarena, what did we ask for on the demand notice? Just curious.\u201d\n\nPrior to that, on June 13, 2024, at 3:46 PM, Jerome Hedinger sent a brief note: \u201cThanks Sarena!\u201d In response, at 9:56 AM the same day, Sarena Tuttle provided an update: the firm had received Certified Medical Records & Billing from Baptist Health, Bryce was working on the final touches of the demand, and it should go out that day or the next day. She explained that once the Demand is sent, the at-fault insurance company would have 30-45 days to review the information and provide a response, though the Adjuster could respond at any time, and she would update Hedinger promptly to discuss the response in detail. She closed with an invitation to contact her with any questions and restated her contact details and new email address.\n\nAlso on June 13, 2024, at 3:28 AM, Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sarena asking for an update on the progress of the Demand Draft and whether she needed anything else.\n\nLooking back to May 31, 2024, at 9:44 AM, Sarena wrote that she had received the necessary items the previous day toward the end of the day and had sent everything over to Bryce to draft the Demand, with an update to follow as soon as it went out.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, at 4:28 PM, Jerome Hedinger asked, \u201cDid we get you Rory\u2019s vet bills?\u201d Earlier that day, at 2:16 PM, Sarena replied: \u201cThank you so much Jerry, this is perfect. I also received the photos of the fence, which will be helpful as well. I will get all of this over to Aaron & Bryce right now and hopefully get a Demand out by the end of the next week.\u201d\n\nEarlier still, at 1:39 PM on May 30, 2024, Jerome Hedinger wrote: \u201cSarena this is from Aetna. Does this help you.\u201d And the thread continues with Sarena\u2019s subsequent messages noted above.\n\nIn summary, between late May and June 24, 2024, the team coordinated gathering medical records, vet bills, fence photos, and other materials from Jerome Hedinger and Rory, transmitted these materials to Bryce (and Aaron) for drafting a Demand, and communicated about the expected timelines: the Demand being sent, the insurance company\u2019s anticipated 30-45 day review period (with possible earlier responses from the adjuster), and ongoing updates to Hedinger. Sarena\u2019s communications also emphasized the new contact email and provided the firm\u2019s contact details.",

Does this help you?\u201d Later that same day, Sarena replied that the materials from Aetna were \u201cperfect\u201d and that she had also received photos of the fence, which would be helpful. She stated that she would forward everything to Bryce and Aaron so they could draft the Demand, with the hope that it would be sent by the end of the next week. In the afternoon, Jerome followed up asking, \u201cDid we get Rory\u2019s vet bills?\u201d\n\nThe following day, May 31, 2024, Sarena confirmed that the documents were received the previous day \u201ctoward the end of the day\u201d and had been sent to Bryce to draft the Demand, adding that she would update Jerome as soon as the Demand went out.\n\nSeveral weeks later, on June 13, 2024, Jerome checked in again, asking, \u201cHi Sarena, just checking in on the progress for the Demand Draft. Do you need anything else?\u201d Later that morning, Sarena responded that they had finally received the Certified Medical Records and Billing from Baptist Health, and that Bryce was putting the final touches on the Demand. She indicated that the Demand should go out that day or first thing the next day. She also explained that once the Demand is sent, the at-fault insurer would have 30-45 days to review the information and respond, though the Adjuster could respond at any time. She offered to discuss the process further and encouraged Jerome to reach out with any questions. Her contact details at The Whaley Law Firm were provided, including the new email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and the firm\u2019s Louisville address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nOn June 19, 2024, Jerome again asked Sarena, \u201cWhat did we ask for on the demand notice? Just curious.\u201d On June 24, 2024, Sarena apologized for being out of the office the prior week due to a cremation ceremony and said she would check with Bryce about the Demand value and would have someone reach out as soon as possible.\n\nThen, on June 26, 2024, Sarena informed Jerome that Bryce advised the Demand Amount was $25,000.00. She reminded him that the Demand Amount is only a starting point for negotiations and that the insurer would have 30-45 days to respond, anticipating a low initial offer as a normal negotiation tactic. She added that Bryce or Aaron would contact him as soon as a response was received and would discuss the negotiation process in more detail. Jerome replied to Sarena\u2019s message with a thank-you.\n\nThroughout these communications, the parties referenced Bryce and Aaron as points of contact for negotiation and progress; the communications consistently noted timelines (30-45 days for insurer responses; initial offers typically low), the collection and transmission of medical records and related documents (Baptist Health records, other medical records, and Rory\u2019s vet bills), and supporting materials (photos of the fence). The firm\u2019s communications also reiterated the updated contact information for Sarena and the firm\u2019s address and phone numbers.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger \u2013 Premise (Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023). Client: Jerome Hedinger.\n\nOn July 23, 2024, a correspondence chain concerning claim 17N8360G8 was opened between The Whaley Law Firm and State Farm Fire & Casualty. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Jessica L. Paolini of State Farm, forwarding a demand related to the 17N8360G8 matter. In Bryce\u2019s email, which was addressed to Jessica Paolini and copied to Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine project email address (JeromeHedingerZ4403793@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), he noted that the attached demand was being provided and asked Jessica to review it and advise if there were any questions. Bryce\u2019s message also included his firm\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and included a standard attorney-client disclaimer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, refrain from using or forwarding the information, and understand that no waiver of privilege shall apply.\n\nEarlier in the same chain, Jessica Paolini had replied to Bryce at 9:56 AM, indicating that Bryce could forward the demand to the email address above (the State Farm address). This set the stage for Bryce to forward the demand the next morning.\n\nLater that morning, at 10:09 AM, Bryce sent a follow-up email with the subject line [EXTERNAL] Re: 17N8360G8, attaching the demand. In this message, Bryce again addressed Jessica and copied Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine project email address. He thanked Jessica and invited any questions regarding the matter. The communication included Bryce\u2019s signature block with his name, firm, and contact details, and carried the same confidentiality disclaimer that the prior message contained.\n\nAt 10:35 AM, Jessica Paolini replied to Bryce, stating that she had received the demand and would reach out to him shortly. In her reply, she included her direct line (610-358-8405), toll-free line (844-458-4300, ext 6103588405), fax number (844-236-3646), and State Farm\u2019s email address for claims (statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com) along with a note to have only the claim number in the subject line. She also reminded Bryce not to miss calls from State Farm and suggested adding State Farm to his contacts by texting HOME to 62789. Her message also contained the standard State Farm correspondence format and her identifying title as a State Farm Claim Specialist.\n\nTogether, the sequence shows the request for the 17N8360G8 demand was initially sent by The Whaley Law Firm to State Farm with the intent that Jessica Paolini would handle the claim, and that Jessica subsequently acknowledged receipt of the demand and committed to following up, while providing her direct contact channels and instructions regarding email subject content. The chain also confirms that Jerome Hedinger\u2019s file was included in the communications via the Filevine project email address.",

On Saturday I was around a couple of pit bulls at Cherokee Park and it triggered a full blown panic attack. I genuinely wanted to runs I went to sit in the car to get my breathing together to calm down. I\u2019m not trying to be a wimp here but clearly the anxiety I\u2019ve had since the attack has been getting worse. I made an appointment with a therapist who specializes in PTSD. But this is now affecting my daily interactions. At this point should I send in a paper from the psychiatrist?\nFinally have we heard anything back from the other side yet?\n\nReplied to Client:\nGood morning Jerry,\n Do not apologize or feel like your 'wimping' at all. Dog attacks are very serious & unpredictable so it is very common for this type of incident to cause mental & emotional trauma. We completely understand your position. Please do send in any information from the psychiatrist and we will get it added to the demand. Currently, Bryce & the adjuster have been going back and forth confirming facts but we have not received any official response from State Farm. Hopefully, we will hear something more concrete soon. \n__Person Making Contact:__ Sarena\n__Date & Time__: July 24 2024",

This narrative summarizes an external email thread related to the matter Re: 17N8360G8.\n\nThe thread begins with an email from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Jessica L. Paolini of State Farm Fire & Casualty, dated August 12, 2024 at 10:06:26 a.m. The subject line reads Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: 17N8360G8. In the body, Bryce writes: Good morning Jessica, I just wanted to check in and see if we had any updated in this regard. He signs as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., followed by the firm\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message includes a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, advise them of the error, note that no waiver of privilege applies, and that the information should not be used or forwarded to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nThe earlier exchanges in the thread begin on July 23, 2024. At 9:56 a.m., Jessica L. Paolini replied to Bryce, telling him: Bryce, You can forward the demand to the above email address. Her signature identified her as a Claim Specialist for State Farm Fire & Casualty, with direct line 610-358-8405, toll-free 844-458-4300 ext. 6103588405, fax 844-236-3646, and email Statefarmfireclaims@statefarm.com, with guidance to use only the claim number in the subject line. A line encouraging saving State Farm\u2019s contact in the recipient\u2019s phone was included at the end of her signature block.\n\nEarlier that same day, Bryce had sent a message to Jessica with the subject [EXTERNAL] Re: 17N8360G8. In his email, Bryce wrote Good morning Jessica, Please see the attached demand. Let me know if you have any questions in this regard. He closed with his signature block: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email contained the same standard privilege disclaimer as above.\n\n Bryce\u2019s email to Jessica was CC\u2019d to Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address, listed as JeromeHedingerZ4403793@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com in the CC line. The content of his message indicated that the attached demand should be reviewed and that Bryce would be available to answer any questions.\n\nJessica\u2019s reply, sent at 10:35? a.m. on July 23, 2024, to Bryce, stated: Bryce, You can forward the demand to the above email address. She again signed as State Farm Fire & Casualty\u2019s Claim Specialist and provided the same contact details as in her prior message, along with the policy- and claim-number-oriented instruction to keep the subject line limited to the claim number. The email includes State Farm\u2019s standard privilege disclaimer and a reminder to keep the communication within the appropriate channels.\n\nIn addition to the thread content, the messages consistently include the standard email disclaimers indicating privileged information and instructions for handling errors. The thread confirms that an external demand was exchanged and that State Farm was instructed to forward the demand to a specific address, with Bryce providing the attached demand when requested, and Jessica indicating that she would reach out after receiving the demand.\n\nOverall, the chronology covers:\n- July 23, 2024: Jessica instructs Bryce to forward the demand to the specified email address.\n- July 23, 2024: Bryce forwards the attached demand to Jessica, CC\u2019ing Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine address.\n- July 23, 2024: Jessica replies at around 10:35 a.m. that the demand can be forwarded to the above email address.\n- August 12, 2024: Bryce follows up with Jessica from The Whaley Law Firm, asking for any updates in this matter.\n\nClient reference remains Jerome Hedinger, with the case file noted as Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. The subject of the correspondence centers on the matter labeled 17N8360G8. The communications involve counsel for the plaintiff (Bryce Koon, Esq.) and counsel/claims personnel for State Farm (Jessica L. Paolini).

Your claim is over with Bryce for negotiations, let me check in with him and see where we are at. I know he attempted to speak with your adjuster yesterday but I was not a party to the conversation.\u201d The note identifies Sarena as the person making contact, with the date and time recorded as September 11, 2024. The file\u2019s prior entry, \u201cBK Called Adj 09.11,\u201d suggests that Bryce (BK) had attempted to speak with the client\u2019s adjuster around that same date.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. Client: Jerome Hedinger.\n\nThis note records a sequence of communications regarding Jerome Hedinger\u2019s case, beginning with a forward email titled \u201cChecking In.\u201d On Friday, September 13, 2024 at 2:19 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, forwarded the message to Bryce Koon. In that forwarded note, she wrote that Jerry Hedinger is specifically requesting that Bryce give him a call. The forward includes Sarena\u2019s firm contact details and notes a new email address for contact: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971 and office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104.\n\nThe forwarded chain begins with a message from Jerome Hedinger dated September 13, 2024, at approximately 1:58 PM, addressed to Sarena. In this message, Jerry asks that Bryce be called and states he is free all day; he wants to understand where the case stands and to receive an update on the process, and he notes that late afternoon would be perfectly fine. He provides his contact number as 502-417-2550 and signs as Jerry Hedinger.\n\nEarlier that same day, at about 10:48 AM, Sarena replied to Jerry. She wrote that there is no need to worry and that Bryce will reach out to discuss any offers made, noting that she did not believe any offers had been made yet. She also signaled her availability and provided her firm contact details and the new email address.\n\nEarlier communications in the week show ongoing back-and-forth. On Thursday, September 12, 2024, at 4:59 PM, Jerry Hedinger wrote to Sarena: \u201cSarena, didn\u2019t mean to confuse anyone. I\u2019m a bit loopy today\u2019s, sorry for the typos. I was saying I only spoke to you via email.\u201d \n\nThat same day, at 12:22 PM, Sarena wrote: \u201c I do not know if he actually spoke with her, that is why I have to check in with him. Our Files document any and all calls, so I can see he called, but I do not have any notes as to the details at the moment.\u201d Her signature followed.\n\nAt 12:04 PM, Jerry wrote: \u201cDid spoke to anyone, just left you a message.\u201d Sarena again responded at 12:00 PM, writing: \u201cGood morning Jerry, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. I hope you are feeling better now. Your claim is over with Bryce for negotiations, let me check in with him and see where we are at. I know he attempted to speak with your adjuster yesterday but I was not a party to the conversation.\u201d \n\nEarlier still, on Wednesday, September 11, 2024 at 11:14 AM, Jerome Hedinger wrote: \u201cHi Sabrina, just checking on where we are with my case. I had a literal heart attack last week and I\u2019m trying to make sure loose ends are moving in the right direction.\u201d He signed as Jerry Hedinger and provided the contact number 502-417-2550.\n\nIn summary, the record shows Jerry Hedinger, the client in the Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB case, has been trying to obtain an update on the status of his claim. He indicated a recent heart event (a heart attack) and expressed a desire to ensure that loose ends are being addressed. The firm\u2019s staff have communicated that Bryce will contact him regarding any offers (if any have been made) and have noted that, as of the latest messages, no offers had been reported. The communications involve multiple back-and-forths between Jerry and Sarena Tuttle, with Bryce Koon as the designated contact for negotiation updates, and reference to the involvement of Jerry\u2019s adjuster. All messages include the dates and approximate times listed above and reflect the contact information for Jerry and the Whaley Law Firm.",

Re: Checking In.\n\nOn September 11, 2024 at 11:14 a.m., Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sabrina (Sarena) expressing concern about the status of his case and noting he had a heart attack the prior week; he asked that loose ends be moved in the right direction and stated he was trying to understand where things stood. The message began, \u201cHi Sabrina, just checking on where we are with my case. I had a literal heart attack last week and I\u2019m trying to make sure loose ends are moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nOn September 12, 2024 at 12:00 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded: \u201cGood morning Jerry, No worries. I completely understand. Bryce will reach out to discuss any offers made, I did not believe they have made any offers just yet.\u201d She noted that Bryce handles negotiations and that she would check in with him, adding that he had attempted to speak with Jerry\u2019s adjuster the day before, though she was not a party to that conversation. Sarena signed as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address and contact information, and a reminder to note the new email address.\n\nAt 12:04 p.m. on September 12, Jerome replied, \u201cDid speak to anyone, just left you a message.\u201d\n\nAt 12:22 p.m. on September 12, Sarena replied, or noted, that she did not know whether Jerome had spoken with \u201cher\u201d (likely the adjuster), and explained that she needed to check with Bryce. She added that their files document all calls, but she did not have notes detailing the conversation at that moment.\n\nAt 4:59 p.m. on September 12, Jerome wrote again, \u201cDid speak to anyone, just left you a message.\u201d He indicated there may have been some confusion and apologized for typos, reiterating that he had spoken to no one beyond leaving messages for Sarena.\n\nOn September 13, 2024 at 10:48 a.m., Sarena wrote: \u201cGood morning Jerry, No worries. I completely understand. Bryce will reach out to discuss any offers made; I did not believe they have made any offers just yet.\u201d This confirmed that, as of that morning, no offers had been made.\n\nAt 1:58 p.m. on September 13, 2024, Jerome replied: \u201cSerena please have Bryce call, I\u2019m free all day. I just want to understand where we are and get an update on the process. Late afternoon is perfectly fine.\u201d He provided the contact number 502-417-2550 and reinforced his availability for an update.\n\nFinally, at 2:20 p.m. on September 13, 2024, Sarena sent a final note to Jerome: \u201cGood afternoon Jerry, I have sent your email over to him & requested he give you a call.\u201d This indicates Bryce was being contacted to call Jerome for an update.\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "This file documents a series of checking-in communications in September 2024 between the client, Jerome Hedinger, and The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager), regarding Jerome Hedinger\u2019s case, labeled Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. The exchanges involve coordinating with Bryce for negotiations, updates on offers, and confirming who has spoken with Jerome\u2019s adjuster.\n\nThe first dated message in the thread is from September 11, 2024, at about 11:14 AM. Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sabrina (Sarena\u2019s colleague or an earlier recipient in the thread): \u201cHi Sabrina, just checking on where we are with my case. I had a literal heart attack last week and I\u2019m trying to make sure loose ends are moving in the right direction.\u201d He included his phone number, 502-417-2550, and signed as Jerry Hedinger.\n\nOn September 12, 2024, at around 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied: \u201cGood morning Jerry, I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. Your claim is over with Bryce for negotiations, let me check in with him and see where we are at. I know he attempted to speak with your adjuster yesterday but I was not a party to the conversation.\u201d Her signature block provides The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information, including 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and notes a new email address.\n\nJerome responded shortly after, around 12:04 PM, stating: \u201cDid speak to anyone, just left you a message.\u201d He again signed as Jerry Hedinger.\n\nAt approximately 12:22 PM, Sarena replied: \u201c?? - I do not know if he actually spoke with her, that is why I have to check in with him. Our Files document any and all calls, so I can see he called, but I do not have any notes as to the details at the moment.\u201d This indicates she was trying to verify whether Jerome\u2019s interaction occurred and notes that the firm\u2019s files track all calls.\n\nLater the same day, about 4:59 PM, Jerome wrote again: \u201cSarena, didn\u2019t mean to confuse anyone. I\u2019m a bit loopy today\u2019s, sorry for the typos. I was saying I only spoke to you via email.\u201d This note clarifies that he intended to indicate he had only communicated with Sarena via email, not by phone.\n\nThe following day, September 13, 2024, around 10:48 AM, Sarena wrote again: \u201cGood morning Jerry, No worries. I completely understand. Bryce will reach out to discuss any offers made, I did not believe they have made any offers just yet.\u201d She also provided her contact details and reminded that Bryce is the point of contact for negotiations and any offers.\n\nThat same day, September 13, 2024, at about 1:58 PM, Jerome replied: \u201cSarena please have Bryce call, I\u2019m free all day. I just want to understand where we are and get an update on the process. Late afternoon is perfectly fine.\u201d He included his number again, 502-417-2550, and signed as Jerry Hedinger.\n\nAdditional details in the chain include Sarena\u2019s signature with the firm\u2019s information and a note to pay attention to her new email address. The communications reference Bryce as the negotiator and discuss whether offers have been made, with Sarena indicating that no offers were believed to have been made yet. The overall intent of the exchanges is to obtain an update on the case status, confirm who has spoken to Jerome\u2019s adjuster, and coordinate a call with Bryce for a potential negotiation update.",

The notification came through RingCentral and was addressed to Sarena Tuttle at extension (502) 357-9971. The call lasted 2 minutes and 58 seconds. A partial voicemail preview states: \u201cDates arena, it is Jerome Headinger. I hope you are doing well. Hey, the reason I am calling. So 3 weeks ago, I had a blood clot/heart attack. Long story short, my cardiologist and the gastro neurologist were not communicating.

The caller identifies themselves as Jerome Headinger in the voicemail preview, though the case file lists the client as Jerome Hedinger. The caller references that three weeks prior he experienced a blood clot/heart attack and alleges a lack of communication between his cardiologist and his gastro neurologist. He states that, during this period, he was not on a blood thinner or on a medication appropriate for the gastro procedures, and that he was taken off of everything, which allegedly led to the clot, nearly killing him and damaging the bottom half of his heart. He describes ongoing problems with the office and claims that the doctor or the cardiologist is a personal friend, but asserts that the office staff has made a major mistake for which he believes he will pay a long-term price in the years remaining in his life. The message is labeled as a partial preview.\n\nThe voicemail instructions note that you can listen to the full message on your phone or by logging into your RingCentral account using your main number, extension number, and password, and that voicemails can be managed within the RingCentral account.",

He said he would send over notes and information from his therapist about recent troubles with dogs and PTSD.\n\nWe also discussed his heart, which is a much trickier situation. He had an aortic valve replacement in 2010 with a mechanical valve and has been taking blood thinners (Warfarin) since then. His gastroenterologist told him to stop taking the blood thinners because of a colonoscopy, but the gastro did not communicate with his cardiology doctor about stopping the anticoagulation. About two weeks after stopping, he developed a clot and had a heart attack. A stent was placed, and the doctors told him that it was because he had been off his heart medications. He does not think the doctors actually signed off on him stopping the blood thinners. He now has to undergo months of cardio rehab and has heart damage, specifically a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, as shown by an echocardiogram.\n\nI told him I would request the records from the treating doctors and look into this. In the meantime, I am going to file his suit.",

The subject line was Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943).

Included is a word copy for your convenience. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.\u201d The email identified The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone and fax numbers as provided, and included the standard attorney\u2011client disclaimer asserting that the message may contain privileged information and should not be shared if received in error; it directed the recipient to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message was received in error and stated that no privilege is waived by disclosure to the named recipient. The email was sent with CCs to Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (JeromeHedingerZ4403793@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com).

Hornback of Dinsmore & Shohl replied: \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding. Paige.\u201d This reply is shown as part of the same email chain and confirms receipt of the forwarded discovery requests.\n\nIn the same exchange, the February 17, 2025 thread shows the initial message from Bryce Koon again, sent to Klapheke and Hornback with the same subject. The message reiterated that Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC were attached along with the associated notice filed that day, and that a Word copy was included for convenience. It again provided the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and carried the same attorney\u2011client disclaimer, followed by the Dinsmore & Shohl \u201cNOTICE\u201d about privilege and error handling.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, at 11:40:38 AM (Eastern Time), Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent another follow\u2011up email to counsel for the defense. The subject again referenced Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). The content read: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on your client's discovery responses.

The email also contained the same Notice from Dinsmore & Shohl regarding privilege.\n\nOverall, the communications document a February 17, 2025 exchange in which Plaintiff\u2019s discovery requests and a Word copy were forwarded to defense counsel, with confirmations of receipt, followed by a March 19, 2025 follow\u2011up seeking an update on the defense\u2019s discovery responses.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943) concerns client Jerome Hedinger. The matter is tracked as Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al., with the docket in Jefferson County identified as 24-CI-006943. The file note identifies the client as Jerome Hedinger and records activity dated to February 2025 through March 2025, involving discovery requests and responses between counsel for the plaintiff and defendant.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC, along with the associated notice filed that day. The transmission included a Word copy of the discovery requests for convenience and indicated that counsel was available to address any questions. The email was addressed to Paige E. Hornback of Dinsmore & Shohl LLP and to David Klapheke, with cc\u2019s that included Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine project email address and Sarena Tuttle, among others. The message carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of the firm\u2019s communications, including a notice stating that the transmission may constitute an attorney\u2011client communication protected by law and instructions to delete or notify the sender if received in error.\n\nPaige Hornback replied later on February 17, 2025, acknowledging receipt with a brief, \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d\n\nEarlier that same day, Bryce sent the discovery materials with the subject line Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943), informing the recipients that the attached materials included Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC and the associated notice, and that a Word copy was provided for convenience. The email identified the recipients as Klapheke and Hornback, with cc\u2019d parties including Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine address and Sarena Tuttle, and it again included the standard privilege notice.\n\nAlso on February 17, 2025, Paige Hornback\u2019s message to Bryce acknowledged receipt of the forwarded materials, indicating they had been received.\n\nSubsequently, on February 17, 2025, Bryce followed up with Paige and David Klapheke, asking for an update on the status of the client\u2019s discovery responses, stating that any update would be appreciated. This follow-up underscored that the plaintiff was awaiting responses to the discovery requests.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, Paige Hornback responded to Bryce\u2019s follow-up, noting that they were showing the discovery responses were due today and that they were working on finalizing their responses. She explained that additional information and documents were needed to finalize and serve the responses and asked whether they could have an additional 30 days to respond, which would push the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025. She thanked Bryce for considering the request and provided her contact details and firm information: Paige E. Hornback, Associate at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202; telephone 502-540-2594; fax 502-585-2207; email Paige.Hornback@dinsmore.com.\n\nBryce\u2019s reply to that request was sent later on March 19, 2025, with a concise, courteous note: \u201cNot a worry at all. Thank you for getting back to me \u2013 April 18th will be fine.\u201d This response was sent on the same day as Hornback\u2019s extension inquiry and was addressed to Paige Hornback, with David Klapheke and other cc\u2019d recipients still included.\n\nThroughout this email chain, the parties continued to exchange communications related to discovery timing, with the February 17, 2025 transmission formalizing the discovery requests, the mid-February receipt acknowledgment, and the March 19, 2025 extension discussion that ultimately established April 18, 2025, as the prospective new deadline for serving discovery responses, pending agreement.",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns the Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. case, Jefferson County, docket number 24-CI-006943. The client listed is Jerome Hedinger, and the record is filed in the Jerome Hedinger Premise database dated October 24, 2023.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, at approximately 12:56 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to David Klapheke and Paige Hornback of Dinsmore & Shohl LLP regarding the above matter. The email was CC\u2019d to the Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 Filevine project email address (JeromeHedingerZ4403793@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and to Sarena Tuttle. The subject line was Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). In the body of the email, Bryce attached Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC along with the associated notice filed that day, and noted that a Word copy was included for convenience. He invited any questions about the matter. He closed with thanks and his signature, identifying himself as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. The email contained the standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notice, stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not waive any privilege or forward the information to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nThat same day, February 17, 2025, at around 12:59 PM, Paige E. Hornback, Associate at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, replied to Bryce. Her response read simply, \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d Paige\u2019s signature block followed, identifying her as an Associate at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address at 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202, and contact details including T: (502) 540-2594, F: (502) 585-2207, and E: Paige.Hornback@dinsmore.com. The signature also included a reference to Dinsmore & Shohl\u2019s website, dinsmore.com, and a placeholder image labeled [image: Dinsmore]. The email again carried a confidentiality disclaimer similar to Bryce\u2019s prior message, noting that the electronic transmission may be privileged and should not be used by anyone other than the intended recipient.\n\nIn the header of Bryce Koon\u2019s March 19, 2025 email, dated Wednesday, March 19, 2025 at 11:40:38 -0400, Bryce wrote again to counsel involved in the Jefferson case. The To field listed Paige Hornback and David Klapheke, and the CC field again included the Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle. The subject line repeated the case name, Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). The body of this message read: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on your client's discovery responses. Any update is appreciated.\u201d Bryce\u2019s signature block followed, including his Whaley Law Firm information and contact details (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207). The email again included the customary attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notice, stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and that any attachment should not be used or forwarded if received in error, and that no waiver of privilege applies.\n\nThe email chain also included, as part of the correspondence, the standard notice from Dinsmore & Shohl regarding the privileged nature of attorney-client communications and the prohibition on transmission to unauthorized persons. It advised that if the transmission was received in error, the recipient should delete it and notify the sender so the address record could be corrected.\n\nIn sum, the record details two converts between counsel on the discovery in Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al., with initial distribution of the Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests on February 17, 2025, a brief acknowledgment from Dinsmore & Shohl on the same day, and a follow-up inquiry from Bryce Koon on March 19, 2025 seeking an update on the discovery responses.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. in Jefferson County, docket 24-CI-006943. This note chronicles a chain of email communications between counsel regarding plaintiff discovery responses and a request for an extension.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Paige E. Hornback, an associate at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, and to David Klapheke, also with Dinsmore. The subject was Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). In the body, Bryce attached Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC, along with the associated notice filed that day, and included a Word copy for convenience. The message also stated that if there were questions, Bryce should be contacted. The email was CC\u2019d to Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine address) and to Sarena Tuttle. It also carried the standard attorney-client disclaimer common to these transmissions, noting that the message may contain privileged information and that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or use the information.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 12:56 PM, Bryce had sent the email described above, and at about 12:59 PM Paige Hornback replied with a brief acknowledgment: \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d Paige\u2019s reply included her Dinsmore signature block, listing her title as Associate and providing the firm\u2019s Louisville address (101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202), telephone and fax numbers, and her email and website.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, at 11:41 AM, Bryce followed up with Paige and David Klapheke, asking for an update on the plaintiff\u2019s discovery responses and indicating that any update would be appreciated.\n\nLater that day, at 16:15:53 UTC, Paige sent a reply to Bryce, noting that discovery responses were due today and that her office was working to finalize responses but required additional information and documents to finalize and serve. Paige requested an extension of 30 days, which would move the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025, and asked for confirmation that this extension would be agreeable. Paige\u2019s message was again CC\u2019d to Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address, Sarena Tuttle, David Klapheke, Elizabeth Harbolt, and Linda Bandy. Paige\u2019s closing included her Dinsmore contact details as listed above.\n\nThroughout the chain, the correspondents included the following participants: Paige E. Hornback (Dinsmore & Shohl LLP), Associate; and Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm). The CC recipients included Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine address, Sarena Tuttle, David Klapheke, Elizabeth Harbolt, and Linda Bandy. The emails repeatedly reference discovery, the need for information and documents to complete discovery responses, and a proposed thirty-day extension to the response deadlines.\n\nThe transmission bottom notes included standard email-like notices about privileged information and proper use: an attorney-client privilege disclaimer indicating that the electronic transmission may constitute privileged communications, that it is intended only for the named recipient, and instructions for recipients who may have received the email in error to delete it and notify the sender to correct the address record.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023. Client: Jerome Hedinger.\n\nIn the matter of Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943), counsel communications concerning discovery were exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and Dinsmore & Shohl LLP. The Whaley Law Firm represented the plaintiff, Jerome Hedinger, with W. Bryce Koon, Esq. acting as lead counsel, whose firm address is 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and who could be reached at (502) 365-5043 (fax: 502-237-3207). Dinsmore & Shohl LLP represented the defendant(s), with Paige E. Hornback, Associate, operating at 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202 (telephone 502-540-2594, fax 502-585-2207). The discovery-related emails contained standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notices.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce Koon sent plaintiff\u2019s discovery requests to defendant 432 Atwood, LLC, along with the associated notice filed that day, and attached a Word copy for convenience. He cc\u2019d the Jerome Hedinger Filevine project email address (JeromeHedingerZ4403793@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Sarena Tuttle, and included the same generic disclaimer about privilege and intended recipients. The email from Bryce stated that it contained Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC and noted that a notice had been filed that day, with an attached Word copy for convenience. A separate notice paragraph reminded that the transmission could be privileged and should be deleted or reported if received in error.\n\nLater on February 17, 2025, Paige Hornback replied to Bryce: \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d This response came from Hornback\u2019s Dinsmore & Shohl email account, which also carried the firm\u2019s standard signature block and the privilege disclaimer. Earlier that same day, Bryce had sent another message to David Klapheke and Paige Hornback with the subject line \u201cJerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943).\u201d In that thread, Bryce wrote: \u201cAttached please find Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC along with the associated notice filed today. Included is a Word copy for your convenience. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.\u201d He again noted the affiliation with The Whaley Law Firm and provided contact information, along with the customary confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier still on February 17, 2025, Bryce had written to the opposing counsel (to Klapheke and Hornback) reiterating the same subject and attaching the discovery requests and notice, and a copy was sent to Sarena Tuttle and the Jerome Hedinger Filevine address. That message concluded with the standard attorney-client privilege notice.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, the matter progressed with an extension discussion. Bryce sent a follow-up email at 11:41 AM to Paige Hornback and David Klapheke, asking for an update on the defendants\u2019 discovery responses and indicating that any update would be appreciated. On the same day, Paige replied at approximately 12:16 PM, explaining that the defendants\u2019 discovery responses were due to Bryce that day but that they needed additional information and documents to finalize and serve the responses. Paige requested a 30-day extension, stating that it would push the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025, and asked whether that would be agreeable.\n\nThat afternoon, at 12:28:21 PM on March 19, 2025, Bryce replied: \u201cPaige, Not a worry at all. Thank you for getting back to me - April 18th will be fine.\u201d He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the same Louisville address and contact details previously listed, and included the same attorney-client privilege disclaimer. The email chain also carried the firm\u2019s standard \u201cNOTICE: This electronic mail transmission...\u201d disclaimer typical of Dinsmore & Shohl\u2019s communications.\n\nIn sum, the parties engaged in a routine discovery exchange for Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, with plaintiff\u2019s counsel issuing discovery requests on February 17, 2025, defendant\u2019s counsel acknowledging receipt, and a March 19, 2025 request by the defense for a 30-day extension to April 18, 2025, which plaintiff\u2019s counsel accepted.",

Please update the email address you have on\nfile, it appears you sent this to an old email that honestly should be\nclosed at this point. However, Bryce has spoken with the Defense for the\nProperty Owner, 432 Atwood LLC and we are awaiting their responses to our\nDiscovery Requests. Currently, they have until April 19th to respond.\nUnfortunately, we still have not received an Answer to Complaint from Mr.\nBrown and/or Mrs. Burden, though they have been served. We will continue to\nmove forward into litigation with Defendant 432 Atwood and will consider\nDefault Judgements on the Brown & Burden at a later date. If we sought the\nDefault Judgement on them now, it could hinder our claims against 432\nAtwood LLC. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to\ncontact us directly to discuss them in further detail.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle\nLitigation Paralegal &\nWorkers' Compensation Case Manager\nThe Whaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Lane\nLouisville, KY 40222\nD: (502) 357-9971\nO: (502) 583-4022 ext 104\nE: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\n(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS)\n\nOn Wed, Mar 19, 2025 at 4:44?PM Jerome Hedinger \nwrote:\n\n> Hey Serena,\n>\n> I hope Spring is kicking into gear well.

      "natural_language": "This is a case note for client Jerome Hedinger regarding the Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023 matter. The email thread titled \u201cRe: Checking In\u201d was sent on Thursday, March 20, 2025 at 10:47:02 a.m. -0400 from Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Jerome Hedinger, with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon copied on the message.\n\nIn that email, Sarena begins by greeting Jerry and thanking him for reaching out. She asks that he update the email address on file, noting that he had sent the message to an old address that should ideally be closed. She then informs him that Bryce has spoken with the defense for the property owner, 432 Atwood LLC, and that they are currently awaiting responses to the firm\u2019s discovery requests; the opposing party has until April 19th to respond.\n\nSarena also reports that the firm has not yet received an Answer to Complaint from Mr. Brown and/or Mrs. Burden, although those individuals have been served. The plan is to continue with litigation against Defendant 432 Atwood LLC and to consider Default Judgments on Brown and Burden at a later date. She notes that pursuing a Default Judgment against Brown and Burden now could hinder the firm\u2019s claims against 432 Atwood LLC. She invites Jerry to contact the firm directly if he has any further questions to discuss in more detail.\n\nThe message is signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line is (502) 357-9971, the office line is (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating this is her new email address.\n\nFor context, an earlier exchange occurred on March 19, 2025, when Jerome Hedinger wrote to Sarena: \u201cHey Serena, I hope Spring is kicking into gear well. I was wondering if Brice had an update on the dog bite. Is there anything I can get to you all. Jerry Hedinger.\u201d",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson County, 24-CI-006943). Client: Jerome Hedinger. This narrative summarizes the email communications and discovery-related activity in the Jerome Hedinger matter, as reflected in the file labeled Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023.\n\nIn the case caption and introductory materials, the parties and counsel are identified. The Whaley Law Firm, represented by W. Bryce Koon, sent multiple communications to Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, where Paige E. Hornback was one of the principal recipients. The email thread includes the following participants: Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm), Paige E. Hornback (Dinsmore & Shohl LLP), David Klapheke (Dinsmore), Sarena Tuttle (Whaley), Elizabeth Harbolt (Dinsmore), and Linda Bandy (Dinsmore). The CC line also includes a Filevine project address for Jerome Hedinger and the client\u2019s file that is labeled Jerome Hedinger DB 10/24/2023. The subject line in the key exchange is Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). The latest dated note in the file is May 1, 2025.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, W. Bryce Koon sent an email to Paige Hornback and David Klapheke, with Jerome Hedinger\u2019s Filevine project copied to Sarena Tuttle. The message attached Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC, along with the associated notice filed that day, including a Word copy of the discovery requests for convenience. The message included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer and entailed the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The transmission also carried the Dinsmore notice disclaimers about privileged communications and proper handling if received in error. Paige Hornback responded later that day, replying that she had received the attachment or information forwarded, and acknowledging receipt of Bryce\u2019s message. The exchange included the same typical privilege disclaimer language at the end of the message.\n\nEarlier on February 17, 2025, there is also a record of Bryce following up on discovery responses, indicating a desire for an update. The thread shows Paige\u2019s responsive acknowledgment on the same day, confirming receipt of Bryce\u2019s prior transmission.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, Paige Hornback advised Bryce that their discovery responses were due that day and that they were working to finalize them, but they needed additional information and documents to complete and serve the responses. She requested a 30-day extension, which would move the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025.\n\nBryce Koon replied that the extension would be acceptable, noting, \u201cApril 18th will be fine.\u201d This exchange confirms the agreed extension of time for the responses to be served, with the date set to April 18, 2025.\n\nSubsequently, on April 23, 2025, Bryce sent another follow-up message to Paige Hornback, stating that he was following up again on the outstanding items. The message again included his contact information and the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s standard confidentiality notice.\n\nFinally, on May 1, 2025, Bryce sent another follow-up email to counsel, reiterating that he was following up on these matters. The message again carried the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s signature block and a standard confidentiality/disclaimer notice, consistent with the prior communications. The header shows the date as Thursday, May 1, 2025, 04:27:26 GMT-04:00, with Bryce Koon addressing Paige Hornback and copying the Jerome Hedinger Filevine project address, Sarena Tuttle, David Klapheke, Elizabeth Harbolt, and Linda Bandy.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the parties circulated discovery requests and related notices, discussed the due date for responses, and negotiated an extension to April 18, 2025. The communications include formal confidentiality and privilege notices typical of the respective law firms and preserve all identified participants and contact details, including firm names, addresses, and telephone and fax numbers.",

      "natural_language": "Chronology of discovery-related correspondence in the matter of Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, Jefferson County, 24-CI-006943, involving plaintiff Jerome Hedinger and defendants\u2019 counsel, Paige Hornback and David Klapheke of Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, with W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm representing the plaintiff.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce Koon, of The Whaley Law Firm, sent to Paige E. Hornback and David Klapheke at Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, with Jerome Hedinger and Sarena Tuttle cc\u2019d (via the Jerome Hedinger Filevine project email address), Plaintiff\u2019s Discovery Requests to Defendant 432 Atwood, LLC, along with the associated notice filed that day. He included a Word copy of the discovery materials for convenience and invited questions if any arose. The subject of that exchange was the case Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-006943). Paige Hornback acknowledged receipt later that day, writing, \u201cReceived. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d\n\nThe same February 17, 2025 thread also included Bryce\u2019s initial forwarding message with the attached discovery requests and notice, and it carried the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimers typical of electronic correspondence from the parties\u2019 counsel. The message chain indicated ongoing exchange of discovery materials and related formal notices between The Whaley Law Firm and Dinsmore & Shohl LLP.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, Paige Hornback sent two messages within the same day. At 12:16 PM, she wrote that discovery responses were due that day and that her team was working to finalize them, but requested an additional 30 days to respond, which would extend the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025. Bryce Koon responded later that day at 12:28 PM, signaling that an extension to April 18, 2025 would be fine and that he would proceed accordingly. Earlier in the same thread, at 12:28 PM, the exchange confirmed the proposed extension to the April 18, 2025 deadline.\n\nOn April 23, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up with Paige Hornback, stating, \u201cGood morning Paige, Just circling back on these responses. Any update appreciated.\u201d The note indicates that the parties were still awaiting discovery responses and that no update had been provided at that time.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Bryce again followed up, writing that he was following up on these matters \u201cagain,\u201d underscoring the continued request for action on the discovery responses.\n\nFinally, on May 13, 2025, Bryce sent an email stating, \u201cGood morning counsel, Please see the attached Motion to Compel filed today. As you can see, we have set it for motion hour two weeks out, on May 26, 2025. Should we receive your client's responses before then, I will be happy to remand my motion.\u201d The email noted the attached Motion to Compel and the scheduled hearing date, and it again included the standard privilege and confidentiality notices common to such correspondence.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information appears at the end of the May 13, 2025 communication: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207.

      "natural_language": "Case: Jerome Hedinger v. 432 Atwood, LLC, et al. in Jefferson County, 24-CI-006943. Client: Jerome Hedinger. This note documents a series of email exchanges between counsel regarding discovery and a pending motion in the Jerome Hedinger matter, listed in the Jerome-Hedinger-Premise-DB-10-24-2023 file.\n\nThe correspondence began with a February 17, 2025 exchange. Paige E. Hornback of Dinsmore & Shohl LLP replied to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledging receipt of Bryce\u2019s prior message: \u201cBryce, Received. Thanks for forwarding.\u201d\n\nOn March 19, 2025, the parties continued to discuss discovery and deadlines. At roughly 12:16 PM, Paige Hornback asked Bryce if an additional 30 days could be granted to finalize and serve discovery responses, extending the deadline to Friday, April 18, 2025. She noted that their discovery responses were due that day and requested the extension to complete the necessary information and documents. Bryce Koon followed up later that day, around 11:41 AM, expressing appreciation for the update and indicating that he would welcome the extension if it could accommodate their schedules. In response, Paige\u2019s message, sent shortly after, suggested that the extension to April 18 would be acceptable, and Bryce replied again at approximately 12:28 PM, confirming that April 18 would be fine.\n\nOn March 19, 2025, Bryce also advised Paige that the parties were working toward finalizing discovery responses and that he would await their updates. Paige\u2019s prior communication had requested the extension to April 18, 2025, and Bryce indicated that he could proceed on that basis.\n\nThe dialogue continued on April 23, 2025, with Bryce writing to Paige to circle back on the discovery responses and to request any available updates. He emphasized the need for current information to move matters forward.\n\nA follow-up on May 1, 2025, showed Bryce again pressing for responses, stating that he was following up on the outstanding items.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, the parties\u2019 calendars and filings took a more formal turn. Bryce sent a message at 10:51 AM to Paige and David Klapheke, with Elizabeth Harbolt, Linda Bandy, and the Jerome Hedinger Filevine project address CC\u2019d. He attached a Motion to Compel, noting that it had been filed that day and that it was set for a motion hour two weeks out, on May 26, 2025. Bryce added that if they received the opposing party\u2019s responses before that date, he would be happy to remand the motion. In a contemporaneous message sent later that day at 12:58:51 PM, Bryce informed Paige that the clerk had notified him there would be no motion hour on May 26, 2025, and that the motion would instead be rolled to the following Monday, June 2, 2025. He reiterated the same courtesy details and provided his contact information and firm affiliation.\n\nPaige Hornback replied on the same day, May 13, 2025, expressing appreciation for the courtesy and stating that the opposing side would finalize their responses in advance to avoid needing a courthouse trip. Her signature block indicated she is an Associate with Dinsmore & Shohl LLP, located at 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 2500, Louisville, KY 40202, with the firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nFor reference, the emails were exchanged among the following participants and addresses: Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207; bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) and Paige E.
