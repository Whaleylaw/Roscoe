      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang MVA-09-03-2021. The client is Brenda Lang, and the file reference for the motor vehicle accident is 410220052.\n\nBetween May 22 and May 23, 2023, Brenda Lang’s counsel, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, engaged in a sequence of email exchanges with Clarke McCulloch, Property & Casualty Claims Manager. The May 22, 2023 correspondence began with Aaron acknowledging receipt of a denial on the claim and challenging the basis for denial. He stated that the basis claimed—that his client was “confused on what transpired”—was inaccurate, explaining that Brenda was not confused about what happened, but rather about where the service driver came from since the driver turned in front of her. He asked whether the vehicle had a camera, suggesting that such footage could possibly resolve the dispute, and asked for a reply.\n\nIn Clarke McCulloch’s May 22, 2023 reply, he indicated that the incident involved a service truck belonging to the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD). He noted the truck was not equipped with a camera. He stated that both the driver and passenger attested that they had a green light and that Brenda Lang ran the red. He added that any evidence to the contrary would be taken into consideration.\n\nOn May 23, 2023, at 2:58 PM, Aaron sent another message to Clarke. He wrote: “Clarke, I do not consider a passenger in the vehicle to be a disinterested third party. As a practical matter trying hard not to be partisan, what do you think is more likely? A person brazenly runs a red light or a person turns right on red (which they are legally allowed to do) and just doesn't see the person coming?” This message was part of continuing discussion about liability and the available evidence.\n\nThe May 23 message also includes the earlier May 22 correspondence from Aaron, which reiterated his questions and concerns and requested information about whether the service vehicle had a camera to help resolve the dispute. The email chain shows Aaron Whaley’s law firm details (Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022) and the standard law firm signature, along with the partial contact list and file reference 410220052.\n\nIn summary, the exchange documented that the case centers on a collision involving a service truck from LMPD, which reportedly had no camera, with both the driver and passenger claiming they had a green light and Brenda Lang running a red; Brenda’s counsel sought to understand the opposing view, questioned the potential influence of a passenger as a non-disinterested party, and repeatedly asked whether a camera existed to resolve the dispute.",

      "natural_language": "In the Brenda Lang motor vehicle accident matter (Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), relating to claim number 410220052, counsel exchanged a series of emails on May 22–23, 2023. The participants included Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, communicating with Clarke McCulloch of the insured’s representatives, with CC copies to Chris Welch, Jessa Galosmo, Justin Chumbley, and a filevine email for Brenda Lang’s matter.\n\nOn May 22, 2023 at 2:59 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Clarke McCulloch, with Chris Welch, Jessa Galosmo, Justin Chumbley, and the Brenda Lang Filevine address copied, attaching the subject “410220052.” In the email, Whaley acknowledged receipt of Clarke’s denial and stated that Clarke’s basis was that his client was “confused on what transpired.” Whaley contended that the confusion was about where Clarke’s driver came from, noting that if someone turned right in front of his client, she might be confused about their origin as well. He asked whether Clarke’s vehicle had a camera, suggesting that a camera could potentially resolve the dispute, and requested a response. The message concluded with Whaley’s signature block, including his firm’s contact information: Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.\n\nLater that evening, Clarke responded on May 22, 2023 at 6:22 PM. He explained that the incident involved a service truck belonging to the Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) and that the vehicle was not equipped with a camera. Despite this, he stated that both the driver and passenger attested they had a green light and that “your client ran the red.” He added that any evidence to the contrary would be taken into consideration. This response was followed by Clarke’s standard title and contact details.\n\nThe following day, May 23, 2023, at 2:58 PM, Whaley replied to Clarke (with the same CC recipients and subject line). He argued that a passenger in the vehicle should not be considered a disinterested third party. He framed the question in terms of likelihood, asking Clarke to consider what was more probable: “A person brazenly runs a red light or a person turns right on red (which they are legally allowed to do) and just doesn't see the person coming?”\n\nAt 3:28 PM on May 23, 2023, Clarke sent another response reiterating the core issue. He described the matter as “really a very simple matter,” noting that there were two drivers each claiming a green light at an intersection where only one could have had the green. He stated that the other vehicle sustained significant damage and that Whaley’s side had not issued a demand against Ms. Lang because the burden of proof lay with the claimant, and there was no evidence proving that Clarke’s client had the green light. He added that now Whaley represents the claimant, and the claimant bears the same burden of proof, and he posed the question, “How do you prove that we ran the red light?” The email concluded with Clarke’s signature, identifying him as Property & Casualty Claims Manager.\n\nFinally, on May 23, 2023 at 3:31 PM, Whaley wrote back to Clarke (with the same CC list and subject). He stated: “Clarke, testimony is proof. It would be up to the jury who to believe. They could believe based upon your driver and passenger that Ms. Lang ran the light. They could believe Ms. Lang that your insured turned right on red.” This message continued the discussion about how the testimony of the participants could be interpreted by a jury.\n\nThe chain also included Clarke’s prior note from May 22, emphasizing that the service truck involved did not have a camera and that the driver and passenger had attested to a green light, as well as Whaley’s earlier assertion that the client was not confused about what happened but rather about where Clarke’s driver came from. The correspondence consistently referenced claim number 410220052 and involved the ongoing strategic dispute over which party had the right-of-way at the intersection and how best to prove who ran the red light.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative covers Brenda Lang’s motor vehicle accident case ( Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), specifically claim number 410220052, based on correspondence from May 22–23, 2023 between Brenda Lang’s counsel and the insurer’s representative. The underlying accident occurred on September 3, 2021, and involved Lang as the claimant against a Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) service truck. The accident diagram referenced in the discussion shows Lang’s vehicle damage at the 1:00 position (passenger front) and the other vehicle’s damage at the 11:00 position (driver front). The police report does not specify who struck whom. The service vehicle in question was described as a Ford F-450, nearly 20 feet long and weighing over four tons.\n\nOn May 23, 2023 at 7:00 PM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm wrote to Clarke McCulloch, the Property & Casualty Claims Manager for the opposing insurer, noting Lang’s view that the other driver “didn’t get very far into his turn before the impact,” and that the report does not identify who hit whom. Whaley emphasized that Lang’s client had no time to see a 20-foot-long vehicle and stated that he had litigated similar cases before and was prepared to litigate again. He also noted that there is more than one way to approach these cases and that he was comfortable with either path.\n\nClarke McCulloch later responded, pointing out that the police report indicates Unit #1 (Lang) stated the same about her approach but appeared confused about where Unit #2 (the truck) came from. He highlighted that the truck—a Ford F-450—was nearly 20 feet long and weighed over four tons, and that Lang hit it. He questioned how she could be confused about where a vehicle this large came from unless she wasn’t paying attention, and he suggested that missing the color of the light could also be easy in this scenario. He described the situation as “most likely,” but admitted he could not prove it and would need proof to support a claim. He said they were willing to review any evidence establishing the light color but would not agree to pay a claim when the only participants have opposing accounts and the only witnesses are two non-disinterested third parties.\n\nIn a subsequent message, Whaley argued that testimony is proof and that a jury would decide whom to believe. He stated that the jury could credit either the driver and passenger who said Lang ran the light or Lang’s version that the insured turned right on red.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Clarke had stated that this was a simple matter: two drivers, both claiming they had a green light at an intersection where only one could have had the green. The insurer’s vehicle suffered significant damage, but no demand had been issued against Lang because the burden of proof lies with the claimant. Now that counsel represents the claimant, the same burden applies, and the question remains how to prove that the other party ran the red light.\n\nClarke had previously informed Whaley that the service truck belonged to LMPD and was not equipped with a camera, but that both the driver and passenger attested that they had the green light and that Lang ran it. He added that any evidence to the contrary would be considered.\n\nWhaley responded by noting that he did not regard a passenger in Lang’s vehicle as a disinterested third party. He asked for Clarke’s view on what is more likely: a person brazenly running a red light or a person turning right on red and simply failing to see the other vehicle. He also asked whether Clarke’s vehicle had a camera, suggesting that camera evidence could resolve the dispute, and asked Clarke to let him know.\n\nAcross the exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the absence of disinterested third-party witnesses, the lack of camera evidence on the LMPD service truck, and the competing accounts of the accident. The communications reflect ongoing efforts to determine liability and the potential value of light-color evidence, with both sides signaling willingness to review new evidence but remaining cautious about accepting liability without additional proof.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), serving as the plaintiff, Brenda Lang, the discovery correspondence unfolded between February and April 2024. The matter was treated as a motor vehicle accident case (MVA), and the client was Brenda Lang.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, at 8:52 a.m., Scott Gowen, counsel for the Louisville Metropolitan Government, sent an email to W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and Aaron Whaley with discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer. The discovery requests were attached in Word and PDF format. Gowen asked for confirmation of receipt and copied Sarena Tuttle and BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com on the communication. The message included the confidentiality disclaimer typical of such emails.\n\nLater that same day, at 9:18 a.m., Bryce Koon replied. He acknowledged receipt of the discovery requests and stated that they would be returned promptly. His reply included the standard confidentiality notice and caution that the email originated outside Louisville Metro, advising recipients not to click links or forward the content if received in error. Koon's signature contained his firm’s contact details.\n\nBefore this February exchange, Gowen’s initial note to the defense team was explicit about attaching discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer; he asked the recipients to confirm receipt and again included the confidentiality disclaimer in his message.\n\nSeveral weeks later, on April 9, 2024, additional correspondence occurred. At 11:02 a.m., Bryce Koon wrote that, after reviewing his file, it did not appear that the defense had received the client’s discovery responses yet and asked Scott Gowen to indicate when those responses might be expected. The message carried the outside-mail caution and the standard confidentiality disclaimer, with Koon’s usual contact information in the signature.\n\nThat afternoon, at 3:53 p.m., Gowen responded. He requested, in turn, to have until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologized for the oversight and delay.\n\nLess than an hour later, at 4:04 p.m., Koon replied to Gowen with a short, accommodating acknowledgment: “Scott, That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me.” This message also carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the emails consistently included confidentiality language noting attorney-client privilege and instructing that, if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information. The communications involved the principal participants—W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, representing Brenda Lang, and Scott Gowen, representing the Louisville Metropolitan Government—with Sarena Tuttle cc’d on the messages and BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com also included in the CC field.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. The file concerns Brenda Lang in the motor vehicle accident case Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, with Brenda Lang as the client.\n\nIn February 2024, a sequence of discovery-related emails unfolded between counsel for Brenda Lang and the City of Louisville’s representatives. On Monday, February 12, 2024, at 8:52 a.m., Scott Gowen sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Scott Gowen cc’d, regarding the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter. He attached the discovery requests for Ms. Lang in both Word and PDF formats and asked the recipients to confirm receipt. The subject line was Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet. The message included a standard confidentiality disclaimer stating that the information is confidential and intended only for the recipient, and warning that any disclosure or action in relation to the contents by others is prohibited.\n\nAt 9:18 a.m. on the same day, Monday, February 12, 2024, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied: “Received. We will get these back to you promptly.” His message included his law firm’s contact information and the same attorney‑client privilege disclaimer as part of the signature block.\n\nLater that same day, the February 12 email thread shows additional correspondence from Bryce Koon at 11:02 a.m. in a separate entry, continuing the same discussion about discovery. The request remained that the discovery responses be provided, and the message again carried the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn Friday, February 12, 2024, at 9:18 a.m. (the earlier February 12 message with Bryce’s reply preceded this timestamp in the record), Scott Gowen also sent a message indicating that he had attached discovery requests in Word and PDF for Ms. Lang to answer and requested confirmation of receipt. The message carried the confidential‑disclaimer language as part of the chain.\n\nMoving to April 2024, on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, at 11:02:17 a.m., Bryce Koon sent another message to Scott Gowen with the subject RE: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet. In this email, Bryce wrote that after reviewing his file, it did not appear that the client’s discovery responses had been received yet, and he asked when they could be expected. He again included the standard attorney‑client privilege disclaimer in his email signature block.\n\nLater that same day, at 3:53 p.m., Tuesday, April 9, 2024, Scott Gowen replied to Bryce’s earlier message. He asked for until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologized for an oversight and delay. He signed with his name and included the “Get Outlook for iOS” mobile signature line. The message was accompanied by the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nFinally, at 4:04 p.m. on Tuesday, April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon responded to Scott Gowen with, “Scott, That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me.” His message again included his standard firm signature and the attorney‑client privilege disclaimer.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the participants included W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363) and Scott Gowen (associated with Louisville Metro), along with Sarena Tuttle (cc’d) and the file-specific recipient address BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com (cc’d in the communications). Each email contained the customary confidentiality and privilege notices advising that the message is intended only for the named recipient and that any inadvertent receipt should be reported to the sender, with no waiver of privilege.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This note concerns the matter Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, a motor vehicle accident case. The correspondence below reflects email communications between Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and Scott Gowen, with Brenda Lang copied, related to taking depositions in the case.\n\nOn July 2, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Scott Gowen (cc: Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address) regarding the planned deposition of the client. The subject was Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet. In the message, Koon stated that they would like to take their client’s deposition and asked Gowen to provide some dates in mid-late August that would work for both sides. The email carried a caution about external email: “CAUTION: This email came from outside of Louisville Metro. Do not click links, open attachments, or give away private information unless you recognize the sender's email address and know the content is safe.” It also included the standard confidentiality notice, explaining that the information was intended only for the named recipient and that disclosure or action based on the contents could be unlawful if you were not the intended recipient. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information appeared in the signature: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207.\n\nOn July 5, 2024, at approximately 10:45 AM, Gowen replied that he would like to depose Ms. Lang as well and that both depositions should be able to be completed on the same day. He requested 2–3 dates in late September when he and Ms. Lang would be available. Gowen stated that once he had those dates, he would coordinate with Mr. Hamlet to schedule the depositions.\n\nLater that same day, on July 5, 2024 at 11:18:34 AM, Bryce Koon responded: “Sounds good Scott. I will get back to you shortly with some dates. Thank you.” This message was sent after Gowen’s reply, and the thread continued to discuss scheduling, with the original subject remaining Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet.\n\nThe correspondence included the standard email disclaimers regarding confidentiality and attorney-client privilege, and the messages were distributed to and from The Whaley Law Firm and Scott Gowen, with Brenda Lang cc’d via the Filevine project email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This note memorializes the correspondence in the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter, with the latest activity reflecting scheduling discussions in July 2024 and earlier discovery-related exchanges in February and April 2024.\n\nIn a July 15, 2024 email, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Scott Gowen’s address and to Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm. She stated that her office had wide availability for September and could accommodate nearly any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after October 10. She asked Gowen to provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client. The email included Tuttle’s contact details, noting a new email address, and was dated 1:16 PM Eastern Time.\n\nTurning to the earlier communications, on February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent an email to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, with Sarena Tuttle copied, attaching discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer in both Word and PDF formats and asking for confirmation of receipt. The email included the standard confidentiality notice customary for such communications, advising that the message and attachments are privileged and should not be forwarded if received in error.\n\nLater that same day, Bryce Koon replied, acknowledging receipt of the discovery requests and stating that they would be returned promptly. This exchange was part of the ongoing discovery process in the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet case.\n\nEarlier still, on February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen had requested confirmation of receipt for the attached discovery requests, and Bryce Koon had confirmed that they would be responsive in due course. The chain also included an earlier note from Gowen on the same day indicating that the discovery requests were attached in Word and PDF format and asking for receipt confirmation, with the usual confidentiality disclaimers accompanying the message.\n\nAn additional thread from April 9, 2024 shows a two-part exchange regarding the timing of service of discovery responses. At 3:53 PM, Gowen asked Bryce Koon for an extension to the end of the month to serve the responses, apologizing for an oversight and delay. Bryce replied at 11:02 AM that, after reviewing his file, it did not appear that the client’s discovery responses had yet been received, and he asked for a timeline for when such responses could be expected. Gowen then responded later that afternoon, indicating that the requested extension was acceptable. The exchange included the standard caution and attorney-client privilege notices typical of these communications.\n\nIn sum, the case note captures a sequence of discovery-related exchanges between The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel in early 2024, culminating in a July 2024 scheduling inquiry from Sarena Tuttle confirming available dates in September and after October 10, and preserving the records of prior discovery requests, receipt confirmations, and an extensionrequest discussion.",

      "natural_language": "In the case caption Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, a motor vehicle accident matter labeled Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021, the client is Brenda Lang. This note chronicles a series of communications between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Scott Gowen, an attorney for the opposing side, along with related correspondence within The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, attaching discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer in both Word and PDF formats. He asked for confirmation that the recipients had received the attachments. Later that same day, at 8:52 AM, Gowen followed up with another email to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, confirming that the discovery requests were attached and requesting receipt confirmation. At 9:18 AM, Bryce Koon replied, stating that he had received the discovery requests and that they would be returned promptly.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, at 9:18 AM, Bryce Koon sent a reply confirming receipt and promising to return the discovery responses promptly. The thread continued with Gowen’s earlier message at 8:52 AM noting the attached discovery requests and his request for receipt confirmation. The February 12 exchanges were followed by standard confidentiality notices typical of such communications.\n\nA later exchange occurred on April 9, 2024. At 3:53 PM, Scott Gowen wrote to Bryce Koon asking if he could have until the end of the month to serve the discovery responses, apologizing for an oversight and delay. In response, at 11:02 AM the same day, Bryce Koon acknowledged Gowen’s request by stating that, after reviewing the file, it did not appear that the opposing side’s discovery responses had yet been received and asked when those responses could be expected. A short reply from Bryce, sent later that day around 4:04 PM, stated, “That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me,” indicating that the proposed extension was acceptable.\n\nSeparately, on April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon’s earlier message was accompanied by the standard caution about external email security. The thread also includes the Whaley Law Firm’s signature and contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial  (D) 502-357-9971; office line  (O) 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (note indicates a new email address).\n\nFinally, on July 15, 2024, at 1:16 PM Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Scott Gowen with the subject Re: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet. In this message, she indicated that her office had substantial availability in September and could accommodate almost any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after the 10th. She asked Gowen to provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client. Sarena’s message includes her contact information and a note highlighting her new email address. The email was copied to Bryce Koon and BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nTogether, these communications outline the discovery requests and corresponding responses timeline (February 12, 2024; April 9, 2024) and a scheduling inquiry for September 2024, reflecting ongoing coordination between The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel regarding the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter.",

      "natural_language": "In the motor vehicle case Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), the client is Brenda Lang and the matter involves communications between The Whaley Law Firm and counsel for Marcus Hamlet, with supporting materials copied to the Louisville City Attorney’s Office. The notes document discovery exchange and deposition scheduling activities.\n\nBeginning in February 2024, Scott Gowen of the opposing side sent discovery requests to Brenda Lang’s counsel. On February 12, 2024, Gowen attached the discovery requests in Word and PDF format and asked for confirmation of receipt. That same day, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied, acknowledging receipt with “Received. We will get these back to you promptly.” The correspondence list shows that Gowen’s February 12, 2024 message was copied to Aaron Whaley and to the Brenda Lang filevineapp address, with Sarena Tuttle also copied.\n\nLater on February 12, 2024, Bryce Koon again confirmed receipt of the discovery requests, reiterating that the firm would return them promptly. The earlier message from Gowen to Bryce on February 12, 2024, at 8:52 AM had indicated that the discovery requests were attached and requested confirmation of receipt, and Bryce’s subsequent reply at 9:18 AM confirmed receipt and promised prompt action.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, a brief back-and-forth occurred regarding the discovery responses. Bryce Koon sent a message stating that, after reviewing his file, it did not appear that they had yet received the client’s discovery responses; he asked when such responses could be expected. Gowen replied later the same day, requesting an extension to the end of the month to serve the responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay. A cautionary note about the external origin of the email was included in the message thread, and Bryce’s earlier reply on the same day acknowledged the inquiry.\n\nIn July 2024, the parties again addressed scheduling. On July 15, 2024, the Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Mr. Gowen noting that dates to depose Brenda Lang had been requested on July 15 but no response had been received. They requested that Gowen provide available dates for deposing Lang. Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, signed the message and provided her contact information, including her new email address. The firm’s signature listed The Whaley Law Firm’s mailing address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and main line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address as the new email). The note also shows that Gowen was copied on the communication, along with the BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com address.\n\nA follow-up message from Sarena Tuttle, dated the same day, stated that the Whaley Law Firm’s calendar was fairly open for September and that they could accommodate nearly any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after the 10th; she asked Gowen to provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), the client is Brenda Lang. The communications summarized below show the progression of discovery and deposition scheduling between counsel for the parties.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, attaching in Word and PDF format some discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer, and he asked that Bryce confirm receipt. Later that same day, at 9:18 a.m., Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied that he had received the discovery requests and that they would get back to Gowen promptly. Bryce’s reply included a standard firm signature.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon responded at 11:02 a.m. that, after reviewing his file, it did not appear that they had yet received their client’s discovery responses, and he asked Gowen to indicate when those responses could be expected. Gowen replied later that day, at 3:53 p.m., requesting until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay. Bryce replied at 4:04 p.m., confirming that the request was acceptable and again asking Gowen when they could expect the responses. The message included the usual attorney-to-attorney disclaimer about privilege and confidentiality.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Gowen stating that their office was pretty open the month of September and could accommodate just about any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after the 10th. She asked Gowen to provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client.\n\nOn July 27, 2024, Sarena again addressed Gowen (copying several recipients, including Brenda Lang’s filevine alias and others) with a note requesting deposition dates. She reminded Gowen that, on July 15, 2024, the parties had requested dates to depose his client, and she had not yet received a response. She asked Gowen to provide dates when Brenda Lang would be available to be deposed.\n\nThe email dated August 27, 2024, from Sarena M. Tuttle to Gowen (with the same CCs as before) reiterates the point: Brenda Lang’s deposition dates were requested on July 15, 2024, but no response had been received. She asks Gowen to provide dates that Brenda Lang would be available for a deposition.\n\nFor reference, the communications include the Whaley Law Firm contact details for Sarena Tuttle (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note of a new email address), and Bryce Koon’s contact details (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-364-9363). The CC list also includes Scott Gowen of Louisville Metro and the Brenda Lang MVA filevine address BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. The correspondence concerns the Brenda Lang motor vehicle accident matter, with Scott Gowen representing the plaintiff and The Whaley Law Firm representing the defense, in communications spanning February through August 2024 regarding discovery responses and the scheduling of depositions.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley discovery requests for Ms. Lang in both Word and PDF formats, asking them to confirm receipt. The message was cc’d to Sarena Tuttle and BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and included a confidentiality/privilege disclaimer. Bryce Koon replied later that same morning, 9:18 AM, acknowledging receipt and stating that they would get the discovery responses back promptly, also including the standard attorney-client privilege notice.\n\nLater, on April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon replied to Gowen at 11:02 AM (with a caution about external email sources). He noted that, after reviewing the file, it did not appear they had yet received the client’s discovery responses and asked for an update on when those responses could be expected. Gowen responded in the afternoon at 3:53 PM, requesting until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay.\n\nIn mid-February 2024, the exchange also included the Whaley Firm’s standard legal correspondence and disclosures. The February 12, 2024 messages contained a disclaimer indicating the email’s privileged status and a reminder that the message is intended only for the named recipients; similarly, the later April 9 communications included such notices.\n\nOn July 15, 2024, at approximately 1:16 PM (the exact minute is indicated as 1:16?PM in the record), Sarena Tuttle wrote to Mr. Gowen with respect to deposition scheduling. She indicated that their office was fairly open for September and could accommodate just about any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after October 10, requesting that Gowen provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client.\n\nBy August 27, 2024, Sarena Tuttle sent another message to Gowen (2:39:45 PM) noting that, in July 2024, they had requested deposition dates for Brenda Lang but had not yet received a response. She asked Gowen to provide dates on which his client would be available to be deposed. Gowen replied later that day (20:04:45 UTC), apologizing for the lapse, explaining that he was out of town that week, and promising to supply deposition dates the following week.\n\nThese exchanges trace the ongoing discovery timeline and deposition scheduling efforts in Brenda Lang’s case against Marcus Hamlet, with discovery requests issued in February 2024, a pending response as of April 2024, and deposition scheduling discussions continuing through August 2024, including a promise to provide availability dates after Gowen’s return from travel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang.\n\nIn the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter, the communications presented here reflect ongoing discovery and deposition scheduling efforts between The Whaley Law Firm, representing Brenda Lang, and Scott Gowen, counsel for Marcus Hamlet. The Whaley firm’s litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, Sarena M. Tuttle, sent and received multiple emails in early 2024 with scheduling requests, responses, and confirmations, and the file includes standard confidentiality notices and a note noting Sarena’s new email address.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent discovery requests for Ms. Lang to be answered, attaching the requests in Word and PDF formats and asking Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon to confirm receipt. He also requested that the recipients let him know when they would respond. In response, Bryce Koon replied later that same day, confirming receipt of the discovery requests and that they would be returned promptly. This exchange was part of a longer thread that also included a message from Gowen noting that the discovery requests were attached and requesting receipt confirmation, along with the standard attorney-client confidentiality notice that accompanies such correspondence.\n\nEarlier still in the same thread, Bryce’s February 12 message reiterated that they had received the discovery requests and would get them back promptly. The communication from Gowen and the follow-up reply from Bryce were accompanied by the firm’s confidentiality disclaimer, which warned that the material is intended for the named recipient and that disclosure or forwarding to others is prohibited.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, there was further discussion about the timing of producing responses. Scott Gowen asked for permission to have until the end of the month to serve the discovery responses, apologizing for an oversight and delay. Bryce Koon responded that this arrangement was acceptable and thanked Gowen for the update. Later that day, Gowen sent a follow-up message reiterating the request to extend to the end of the month to serve the responses, and Bryce again acknowledged.\n\nIn the subsequent chronology, there is a separate thread concerning deposition dates. On July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Mr. Gowen noting that their office was fairly open in September and that they could accommodate nearly any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after September 10th, asking Gowen to provide a narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client. On August 27, 2024, Gowen apologized for losing track of the scheduling and explained that he was out of town that week but would provide deposition dates the following week. Earlier on July 15, 2024, Sarena had already requested dates to depose Brenda Lang, and on August 27, 2024, she reiterated that they had not yet received a response to the July 15 deposition-date request.\n\nThat same August 27, 2024 email thread shows Sarena following up at 2:39:45 PM with a reminder that, on July 15, 2024, dates to depose Ms. Lang were requested and that no response had been received; she asked Gowen to provide dates when Brenda Lang could be deposed. The email included a caution note indicating the message came from outside Louisville Metro and warning recipients not to click links or open attachments unless the sender’s address and content were familiar and safe. Gowen replied at 4:04 PM that he was sorry for letting it drop off his radar, that he was out of town that week, and that he would provide some deposition dates the following week.\n\nThe record also reflects the usual disclaimers placed on The Whaley Law Firm emails, including confidentiality notices and notices that the electronic messages are intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged information. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details are: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; main office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email for Sarena Tuttle: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; and a note that this is a new email address. The firm’s standard closing also identifies Bryce Koon, Esq., with the same address and phone numbers.\n\nIn sum, the file documents discovery-response scheduling activity in February and April 2024, with an extension discussion in April, followed by deposition-scheduling attempts beginning in July 2024 and a responsive acknowledgment from Gowen in August 2024, including reminders that a deposition date coordination had not yet been provided and that Gowen would supply available dates soon. The communications preserve all known facts and details from the cited exchanges, including the participants, the dates of the messages, the requested and agreed-upon extensions, the deposition-date requests, the reminders, and the confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang.\n\nThe Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet case, concerning a motor vehicle accident in September 2021, progressed through a series of discovery and deposition scheduling communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Louisville government counsel. The latest thread begins with an email dated September 4, 2024, from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, to Scott Gowen. In that note, she says they are circling back on the matter from the prior week and asks Mr. Gowen to provide deposition dates as soon as he is settled back in. She also references the deposition of Brenda Lang and requests dates that her client can be deposed. The message includes her contact details and notes her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone lines D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104. Cc’d on the thread are Bryce Koon and a filevine application email for Brenda Lang’s matter, and the email shows the subject line “Re: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet.” The message concludes with a typical sign-off and her job title.\n\nPrior to that, on August 28, 2024 at 9:43 AM, Sarena wrote to Gowen: “Good morning Mr. Gowen, We completely understand. Thank you for the update,” followed by her signature and contact information, including the new email address. \n\nThe preceding exchange shows Gowen’s response from August 27, 2024 at 4:04 PM, in which he apologized for letting the matter drop off his radar and explained that he was out of town that week but would provide deposition dates the following week.\n\nEarlier still, on August 27, 2024 at 2:39:45 PM, Sarena had sent a message (with a standard outside-email caution) noting that, as of July 15, 2024, they had requested dates to depose Brenda Lang and had not yet received a response. She asked Gowen to provide dates when his client would be available to be deposed and again signed her name with the firm’s contact information and her new email address.\n\nThe July 15, 2024 communication from Sarena stated that The Whaley Law Firm’s schedule was fairly open in September, with availability on most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th, and she asked Gowen to provide a narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client at that time.\n\nMoving back to an earlier segment of the record, on April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon replied to Scott Gowen with a brief acceptance: “That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me.” Bryce signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the Louisville address and contact details.\n\nEarlier that same day, April 9, 2024 at 3:53 PM, Gowen had written to Bryce requesting an extension to serve the responses, asking for until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay.\n\nAt 11:02 AM on April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon had sent a caution-laden email indicating that the message came from outside Louisville Metro and encouraging the recipient to exercise caution with links and attachments. In that message, Bryce stated: after reviewing his file, they had not yet received the client’s discovery responses and asked when such responses could be expected.\n\nThe chain also contains longer, earlier exchanges from February 2024. On February 12, 2024 at 8:52 AM, Scott Gowen wrote to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, forwarding discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer in Word and PDF formats and asking for confirmation of receipt. The message includes a standard confidentiality notice. Bryce Koon replied later that day, February 12, 2024 at 9:18 AM, confirming receipt and stating that they would “get these back to you promptly.” The thread also shows the earlier February 12, 2024 exchange in which Gowen had initially attached the discovery requests to a message to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon and asked for confirmation of receipt, with the same confidentiality language included.\n\nIn summary, the case involved ongoing discovery and deposition scheduling efforts between The Whaley Law Firm and the counsel for Marcus Hamlet, with repeated requests for available deposition dates for Brenda Lang, responses and extensions for discovery, and a back-and-forth chain of communications spanning February through September 2024. The most recent communication, dated September 4, 2024, again requests deposition dates and notes that the team is awaiting Mr. Gowen’s availability after his return.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. The client in this matter is Brenda Lang, with the case file labeled Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021.\n\nIn this sequence of communications, The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel exchanged multiple emails regarding deposition dates and discovery responses related to Brenda Lang’s motor vehicle accident case against Marcus Hamlet. The first noted exchange in the record occurred on February 12, 2024, when Gowen, Scott sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, attaching discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer and asking them to confirm receipt. Bryce Koon replied later that same day, acknowledging receipt and stating that they would return the discovery materials promptly.\n\nOn April 9, 2024, the matter advanced to scheduling and responses. Scott Gowen sent a message asking for until the end of the month to serve the responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay. Bryce Koon responded later that morning, indicating that, after reviewing his file, they had not yet received the client’s discovery responses and asking when the responses could be expected. The exchange included standard attorney-confidentiality disclaimers, noting that the electronic messages were intended for the named recipients and contained privileged information, with reminders to contact the sender if received in error.\n\nEarlier correspondence in February 2024 also included a back-and-forth about the discovery requests. Gowen had attached in Word and PDF format several discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer and asked for confirmation of receipt, and Bryce Koon confirmed receipt and pledged prompt handling.\n\nJumping roughly to mid-2024, on July 15, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote that their office was fairly open for September and could accommodate most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th, and asked Gowen to provide a narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client.\n\nThe scheduling efforts continued into August. On August 27, 2024, Gowen replied that he was out of town that week but would provide deposition dates the following week. That same day, Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Gowen, noting that on July 15, 2024 they had requested dates for deposing the client and that they had not yet received a response; she asked him to provide dates when Brenda Lang’s deposition could occur. Her message circulated with the caution that the email originated outside Louisville Metro and included the standard disclaimer about external emails. The message also listed the contact details for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to note the new email address.\n\nOn August 28, 2024, Sarena Tuttle again wrote to Gowen, opening with a greeting and saying, “Good morning Mr. Gowen,” and stating that they completely understood and thanking him for the update, indicating ongoing communication about scheduling and deposition dates.\n\nFinally, on September 4, 2024, at 11:34:44 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle reached back out to Gowen, referencing the message from the previous week. She noted that she hoped he had enjoyed his trip and had time to get caught up, and she urged him to provide the deposition dates as soon as he was settled back in.\n\nThroughout these communications, the parties remained focused on securing deposition dates for Brenda Lang’s deposition and on handling discovery responses, with multiple attempts to confirm receipt, coordinate schedules, and adjust timelines, all while maintaining the standard confidentiality disclosures and the contact details for The Whaley Law Firm.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the deposition scheduling and related discovery communications in the matter of Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, a motor vehicle accident case (MVA) with the file label Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. The client is Brenda Lang and the correspondence involves The Whaley Law Firm, represented by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, and Scott Gowen, with the Louisville group.\n\nIn February 2024, the Whaley firm began follow‑up on discovery. On February 12, 2024, Bryce Koon replied to Gowen, noting that “Received. We will get these back to you promptly.” Earlier that day, Gowen had corresponded with Aaron Whaley regarding the matter. Later on that same day, Gowen sent a separate note to Bryce and others, and Bryce reiterated the need for timely discovery responses. A parallel thread shows Gowen asking for additional time to provide the discovery responses; on April 9, 2024, Gowen requested until the end of the month to serve the responses, and Bryce responded the following day, stating that they would get back to him promptly and that they had not yet received the responses.\n\nFrom mid‑April through July 2024, the parties discussed scheduling depositions. On July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle wrote that The Whaley firm’s calendar in September was fairly open and that they could generally accommodate most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th. She asked Gowen to provide a narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client. In a subsequent exchange, Gowen replied on July 15 that they would review dates; by July 27, Sarena noted that they had not yet received dates and reiterated the request for available deposition dates. On August 27, 2024, Sarena reminded Gowen that dates to depose his client had been requested on July 15 and again asked him to provide dates that Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet could attend. Gowen responded later that day, explaining that he had been out of town and would provide dates the following week. On August 28, 2024, Sarena acknowledged the update.\n\nAs September approached, Gowen proposed a deposition date. On September 4, 2024, Gowen suggested September 18 as a deposition date: he could depose Brenda Lang beginning at 9:00 a.m., with Bryce Koon deposing Marcus Hamlet immediately afterward, and he offered to host. In response, Sarena noted that their office was pretty booked for September but could be available on any day after October 1. She closed with a courteous message indicating appreciation for the update and confirming the new availability timeline.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties exchanged standard external-email cautions and signatures. The Whaley Law Firm signatures included their office address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and contact details for Sarena Tuttle (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as the new email address) and Bryce Koon (D/Fax numbers as listed in the chain). A note within the emails repeatedly emphasized that the message and attachments are intended for the named recipient and may contain privileged information.\n\nIn summary, by early September 2024 the parties had discussed deposition dates for Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet, with September 18 proposed but contingent on the availability of scheduling, while the Whaley firm communicated that their September calendar was largely booked, with open availability only after October 1. The exchange reflects ongoing efforts to coordinate deposition logistics and to finalize discovery-related timing in this case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Brenda Lang, arising from a motor vehicle accident on September 3, 2021. The matter proceeded through a series of discovery and deposition scheduling communications in 2024 among Scott Gowen, counsel for Brenda Lang; Sarena Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm’s litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager; and Bryce Koon, also with The Whaley Law Firm, with Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet as the parties.\n\nOn February 12, 2024, Scott Gowen sent discovery requests for Ms. Lang to answer, delivering them in Word and PDF format and asking Bryce Koon to confirm receipt. Bryce replied at 9:18 a.m. that the requests had been received and that they would be returned promptly. Earlier, Gowen had noted that the email containing the discovery materials was confidential and intended only for the named recipient. On the same day, Gowen followed up asking for confirmation of receipt.\n\nA few weeks later, on April 9, 2024, Bryce informed Gowen that they had not yet received Ms. Lang’s discovery responses and asked when they could be expected. Gowen responded later that day, at 3:53 p.m., requesting and apologizing for the delay, and asking for until the end of the month to serve the responses.\n\nProgress toward depositions stalled for several months. On July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle told Gowen that The Whaley Law Firm’s office was open the month of September and that they could accommodate deposition dates on most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after October 10, requesting that Gowen provide a more narrowed set of dates that would work for his client.\n\nThe discussion resumed activity between July and August. On August 27, 2024, at 2:39 p.m., Sarena reminded Gowen that they had requested dates to depose his client back on July 15 and had not yet received any dates indicating when Brenda Lang would be available to be deposed. Gowen replied later that day at 4:04 p.m., explaining that he was out of town that week and would provide dates the following week. The following day, August 28, Sarena responded, acknowledging the situation and thanking Gowen for the update.\n\nBy early September, the parties were moving toward setting a deposition. On September 4, 2024, at 11:34:44 a.m., Sarena again requested deposition dates as soon as Gowen was settled back in. Later that day, at 5:07:30 p.m. (UTC), Gowen replied with a proposed date: September 18. He stated that he could depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 a.m. and that Bryce Koon could depose Mr. Hamlet immediately after; Gowen also offered to host the deposition.\n\nThroughout this correspondence, the chain of messages shows ongoing coordination among the involved attorneys and staff, including the Whaley Law Firm’s updates to Sarena about new email addresses—Sarena Tuttle’s address is noted as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a reminder to note the new email address in the firm’s communications—and the exchange of discovery materials and deposition scheduling between February and September 2024. The CC list for these communications included Bryce Koon and the BrendaLangMVAZ3760694 filevine email, reflecting the case’s administrative tracking.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This matter is Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, with The Whaley Law Firm representing Brenda Lang. The principal contacts shown in the record include Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines are D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext. 104, and her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address). The recipient in the correspondence is Scott Gowen of Louisville, Kentucky, with copies to Bryce Koon and to an account associated with Brenda Lang’s File Vine app.\n\nIn the first relevant exchange, dated September 4, 2024, the sender (Sarena) closed with a message indicating that their schedule for September is largely booked, but that they are available any day after October 1. This update followed an inquiry from Scott Gowen about scheduling depositions.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 1:07 PM, Gowen had written proposing a deposition on September 18, starting at 9:00 AM for Ms. Lang, with Bryce deposing Mr. Hamlet immediately afterward, and offering to host the deposition himself. The message was part of a back-and-forth thread discussing deposition logistics.\n\nIn the preceding messages, there is a longer thread beginning in February 2024. On February 12, 2024, Bryce Koon, Esq. stated, “Received. We will get these back to you promptly,” indicating a response to discovery demands. By April 9, 2024, Scott Gowen requested more time to serve discovery responses, asking for the end of that month. Bryce Koon replied that, after review, it did not appear the client’s discovery responses had yet been received and asked for a timeline. Gowen replied that the extension to the end of the month was acceptable. Bryce acknowledged the arrangement.\n\nThe timeline continued with a July 15, 2024 exchange. Sarena Tuttle informed Gowen that, on July 15, 2024, they had requested dates to depose his client and had not yet received a response. She asked Gowen to provide dates when his client would be available to be deposed. She also noted that their office was fairly open in September and could accommodate most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th, requesting a narrowed set of dates that would work.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, Gowen responded from out of town, apologizing that he had not yet provided deposition dates but that he would supply some dates the following week. Sarena replied on August 27, 2024, at 2:39:45 PM, reiterating that they had requested deposition dates on July 15 and had not yet received a response, and asking for availability. Gowen followed up later that afternoon with an apology for the delay and explained he was out of town. Sarena acknowledged the situation on August 28, 2024, thanking him for the update and expressing understanding.\n\nFollowing these exchanges, on September 4, 2024, at 11:34:44 AM, Sarena again pressed Gowen to provide deposition dates as soon as he and his client were able to settle back in. Later that same day, at 1:07 PM, Gowen replied with a concrete proposal: September 18 as the deposition date, with Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 AM and Bryce deposing Mr. Hamlet immediately after, and he stated he was happy to host. In response, at 1:45:20 PM, Sarena informed Gowen that their schedule for September was largely booked, but they were available any day after October 1.\n\nAcross the thread, the communications consistently revolve around scheduling depositions for Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet, with separate depositions for Lang and Hamlet, the possibility of the defendants appearing for deposition, and the logistics of hosting. The notes reflect repeated attempts to coordinate dates from mid-2024 through early September 2024, including discussions of discovery responses and deposition timing, as well as the constraint that, as of early September, the team’s calendar was full in September and open only after October 1.\n\nIn summary, the case Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet involved ongoing discovery-related correspondence beginning in February 2024, with several back-and-forth exchanges about the timing of discovery responses and the scheduling of depositions. The latest documented proposal (September 18, 2024) was for Ms. Lang to be deposed at 9:00 AM, with Mr. Hamlet’s deposition to follow, hosted by Gowen, but the client’s side indicated September was fully booked and that availability would begin after October 1.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, a motor vehicle accident case filed on September 3, 2021, involving client Brenda Lang. The following narrative summarizes the deposition-scheduling exchanges in the “RE: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet” email thread, centered on the participation of Scott Gowen (emailing from Scott.Gowen@louisvilleky.gov), Sarena Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), and W. Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm) regarding Ms. Lang and Mr. Hamlet.\n\nThe thread begins with an exchange in early 2024 about discovery responses. On February 12, 2024, Bryce Koon (W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm) replied to Scott Gowen, noting, “Received. We will get these back to you promptly.” Earlier, on April 9, 2024, Gowen asked for more time to serve the discovery responses, writing, “Scott Gowen: May I please have until the end of this month to serve the responses? I apologize for the oversight and delay.” In response, Bryce Koon commented that, after reviewing his file, they had not received their client’s discovery responses yet and asked when they might be expected. The exchange also shows a standard attorney-client privilege notice included in Bryce’s messages.\n\nThe deposition scheduling conversation then shifts to July and August 2024, when The Whaley Law Firm requested dates to depose their client and did not receive a timely response. On July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle stated that their office was pretty open for September and requested dates for deposing the other side’s client, Brenda Lang’s deposing party, and to provide dates that the other side’s client is available. On August 27, 2024 at 2:39 PM, Sarena followed up again, noting, “On July 15, 2024, we requested dates to depose your client & unfortunately, we still have not received a response. Can you please provide dates that your client is available to be deposed?” Scott Gowen replied later that day, saying he was out of town and would provide dates the following week. The next day, August 28, 2024, Sarena replied, “Good morning Mr. Gowen, We completely understand. Thank you for the update.” The thread later shows ongoing attempts to pick dates, with the parties seeking times that work within their calendars.\n\nOn September 4, 2024, two messages in the thread show renewed focus on deposition dates. At 11:34:44 AM, Sarena again reached out: “Good afternoon Mr. Gowen, We are just circling back on this one from last week. We hope that you enjoyed your trip and have had some time to get caught up. Please provide us with those deposition dates as soon as you're settled back in.” Gowen responded at 1:07 PM: “Will September 18 work? I can depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 and Bryce can depose Mr. Hamlet immediately after. I am happy to host.” At 1:45 PM, Sarena replied that they were booked for September but open any day after October 1st.\n\nFinally, on September 5, 2024, at 18:52:57 UTC, Gowen proposed an alternative date: Friday, October 25. He wrote, “How about Friday, October 25? I can depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 a.m. and Bryce can depose Mr. Hamlet immediately thereafter. Again, I am happy to host. Please let me know if this works for you guys and I will get a notice out.” This exchange completes the latest scheduling attempt in the thread, with The Whaley Law Firm indicating October 1st or later openings and Gowen offering to host.\n\nThroughout the email chain, the deposition subjects remained Ms. Lang ( Brenda Lang) and Mr. Hamlet ( Marcus Hamlet), with the attendees being Ms. Lang across the table from Gowen and Mr. Hamlet from Bryce Koon’s side, and the depositions described as to occur at Gowen’s hosted location, contingent on the dates agreed.\n\nOther contextual notes from the thread include the recurring caution banners indicating that some emails originated outside Louisville Metro, cautioning recipients about clicking links or opening attachments from unfamiliar addresses. The Whaley Law Firm is identified with the following contact details in the thread: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS”). The Whaley Law Firm’s client contact for the opposing side is reflected as Bryce Koon, Esq., with the firm’s address listed similarly and the firm’s typical disclaimer about privileged information appended to messages. The opposing counsel, Scott Gowen, is connected to the Louisville government (as indicated by the Scott.Gowen@louisvilleky.gov address in the thread).\n\nIn sum, the parties engaged in a protracted dialogue across multiple months (from February through September 2024) to schedule depositions for Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet, with September 18 being proposed, then October 1 as a post-September window, and finally October 25 as a proposed deposition date, all while acknowledging scheduling conflicts and Gowen’s willingness to host and issue a notice if the other side confirms.",

      "natural_language": "The matter is Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, a motor vehicle collision case arising from a 2021 incident (MVA 09-03-2021), with Brenda Lang represented by The Whaley Law Firm and Marcus Hamlet by Louisville city attorney Scott Gowen. Over the summer and fall of 2024, the parties exchanged multiple emails to schedule depositions. The plaintiff’s team included Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, who also provided a new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and listed The Whaley Law Firm’s office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104. The defendant’s side involved Scott Gowen (Scott.Gowen@louisvilleky.gov) and W. Bryce Koon, Esq. (Bryce@whaleylawfirm.com). Several emails included the standard caution banner stating that the message came from outside Louisville Metro.\n\nIn April 2024, the parties began discussing discovery and deposition logistics. On April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon noted that it did not appear the defendant had served discovery responses yet and asked when they could expect them. Scott Gowen replied later that day requesting until the end of the month to serve the responses, apologizing for the delay. Earlier that day, Bryce had asked about the status of the discovery responses as well.\n\nBy mid-July 2024, the issues began to shift toward scheduling depositions. On July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle wrote that their office was fairly open for September and could accommodate most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after October 10, requesting a narrowed set of dates that would work for the opposing side. She reiterated that September was tight but opened up after October 1 if needed.\n\nToward the end of August 2024, there was further back-and-forth about dates. On August 27, Scott Gowen apologized for losing track of the matter due to being out of town and said he would provide dates the following week. A day later, on August 28, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged Gowen’s note and explained that, while they were pretty booked for September, they were open any day after October 1.\n\nIn early September, the parties continued to discuss possible deposition dates. On September 4, 2024, Gowen proposed September 18 as a potential deposition date, with Ms. Lang to be deposed first beginning at 9:00 a.m. and Mr. Hamlet to be deposed immediately afterward, with Gowen offering to host the deposition. In response, Sarena acknowledged the request and noted that they were regrouping after travel, but she reiterated that they remained booked for September and would be open after October 1.\n\nFinally, on September 5, 2024, Gowen proposed Friday, October 25, as the deposition date. He suggested that Ms. Lang be deposed first at 9:00 a.m., followed immediately by Bryce Koon deposing Mr. Hamlet, and that Gowen’s office would again host. He also stated that a notice would be sent. That plan was confirmed later that same day by Sarena, who wrote, “That sounds perfect. Oct 25, 2024 starting at 9am w/PL immediately followed by Def at your office. We will get a notice over to you as well. Thank you so much.”\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the involved attorneys and staff—Sarena M. Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), Scott Gowen (Louisville, KY), and Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm)—worked to coordinate deposition dates and logistics. The notes also include the various iterations of contact details and reminders to send notices, along with the signatures and new email address for Sarena.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), the parties exchanged a series of emails in 2024 concerning deposition dates for Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet, with The Whaley Law Firm representing Brenda Lang and Scott Gowen handling the deposition logistics on the opposing side.\n\nOn September 5, 2024, Scott Gowen sent Sarena Tuttle a note attaching his notice to depose Brenda Lang. In the message, he said that, by copy of the email to court reporter Wendy Cotton, he was requesting that she cover the deposition of Ms. Lang. He also added that Wendy could be told to cover Mr. Hamlet’s deposition if desired. The initial email to Sarena and Bryce Koon also included copies to BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and to Wendy Cotton, with the time stamped 19:50:07 +0000.\n\nLater on September 5, 2024 at 3:13 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied. She indicated that the arrangement sounded perfect and stated that on October 25, 2024, starting at 9:00 AM, the deposition of Brenda Lang would occur with the Plaintiff’s deposition immediately followed by the Defendant’s deposition at Gowen’s office. She also said they would send a notice as well.\n\nThat same day, at 2:53 PM, Gowen wrote back proposing an alternative on October 25: he suggested that Lang be deposed on Friday, October 25, beginning at 9:00 AM, with Bryce deposing Mr. Hamlet immediately afterward. He reiterated that he was happy to host and asked for confirmation that the date and plan would work so he could issue a notice.\n\nEarlier on September 4, 2024, Sarena had written Gowen noting that their office was pretty booked for September, but open any day after October 1. She signed with her Whaley Law Firm contact information, including the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nIn a September 4, 2024, 1:07 PM exchange, Gowen had suggested September 18 as a possibility, stating he could depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 AM and that Bryce could depose Mr. Hamlet immediately after, and that he was happy to host. Sarena acknowledged this in a later message.\n\nBefore that, on September 4, 2024 at 11:34:44 AM, Sarena had reminded Gowen that deposition dates were needed soon and asked him to provide them as soon as he was settled back in. She reiterated her contact information and noted the new email address.\n\nA week earlier, on August 28, 2024 at 9:43:00 AM, Sarena had told Gowen that they understood and thanked him for the update, continuing the thread about scheduling.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, Gowen had replied at 4:04 PM that he was out of town that week but would provide dates the following week. Earlier that same day at 2:39 PM, Sarena replied to Bryce Koon (with Gowen and BrendaLangMVAZ3760694@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com CC’d) noting that, on July 15, 2024, they had requested dates to depose Brenda Lang and that they had not yet received a response; she asked for dates that the client was available to be deposed.\n\nThe thread also shows a prior sequence beginning on July 15, 2024, when Sarena wrote that their office was open for September and that they could look at just about any Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday after the 10th, asking for a narrowed set of dates that would work for the other side.\n\nEven earlier, on April 9, 2024, Bryce Koon had observed that, after reviewing his file, it did not appear they had received Brenda Lang’s discovery responses yet and asked when they may be provided. Scott Gowen replied later that day, asking for until the end of the month to serve the responses, apologizing for the oversight and delay. A separate portion of the chain on April 9, 2024 included Bryce’s signature block with standard attorney-file disclosures.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a back-and-forth spanning April through September 2024, focused on scheduling Brenda Lang’s deposition (and the related deposition of Marcus Hamlet), with proposed dates including September 18, 2024; October 25, 2024 (Lang at 9:00 AM with Hamlet afterward); and the arrangement that a court reporter, Wendy Cotton, would cover Lang’s deposition, and potentially Hamlet’s as well. The scheduling discussions were conducted between The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle and Bryce Koon) and Scott Gowen, with various CC addresses and the plaintiff’s file references, and included notices and hosting arrangements at Gowen’s office.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang.\n\nIn September 2024, the parties continued to coordinate depositions in the motor vehicle accident matter involving Brenda Lang. The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena M. Tuttle and Scott Gowen, with Bryce Koon in copy, exchanged a series of emails, and notices were prepared to be filed via CourtNet. The deposition notices were to be covered by court reporters, with Wendy Cotton (Wendy Cotton, listed in correspondence) identified to cover Lang’s deposition, and each side was invited to arrange coverage for the other side’s deposition if desired.\n\nThe exchange began with a July 15, 2024 email in which Sarena Tuttle noted that their office was open for the month of September and that they could consider most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th. She asked Scott Gowen to provide a narrowed set of dates that would work for him and his client. This message indicated a fairly open window for scheduling depositions but without firm dates yet.\n\nOn August 27, 2024, Gowen apologized for the delay and said he was out of town but would provide dates the following week. In a contemporaneous email, Sarena pointed out that, since July 15, 2024, they had requested dates to depose Brenda Lang’s client, and they still had not received a response; she asked Gowen to provide dates when his client would be available to be deposed. Gowen acknowledged the lag and promised to supply dates next week. A few days later, on August 28, 2024, Sarena responded with a polite acknowledgment: they understood Gowen’s update.\n\nMoving into September, the week of September 4, 2024, Gowen proposed September 18 as a deposition date, indicating he could depose Ms. Lang starting at 9:00 a.m., with Bryce to depose Mr. Hamlet immediately afterward, and noting he was happy to host the depositions. The Whaley firm replied on the same day, September 4, 2024, at 1:45 p.m., with cautionary language about outside emails. The message expressed thanks and explained that they were pretty booked for September but were open on any date after October 1.\n\nEarlier that same day, September 4, 2024, at 11:34:44 a.m., Sarena had written back, indicating they were circling back on the matter from the previous week and asking Gowen to provide deposition dates as soon as he was settled back in.\n\nOn September 5, 2024, Gowen suggested October 25 (Friday) as a deposition date, proposing Lang’s deposition beginning at 9:00 a.m. with Bryce deposing Mr. Hamlet immediately thereafter, and he reiterated his willingness to host. Sarena responded later that day (September 5, 2024, at 3:13 p.m.) that October 25, 2024, starting at 9:00 a.m., with Lang (the plaintiff) first and Hamlet (the defendant) immediately after, at Gowen’s office, would work; she noted that they would provide a notice as well. She also included the caution that this email carried the standard outside-LOUISVILLE Metro notice.\n\nGowen then replied (September 5, 2024, at 2:53 p.m.) confirming the proposal and adding: he had attached his notice to depose Ms. Lang and, by copy to court reporter Wendy Cotton, asked that she cover Lang’s deposition; he invited them to let Wendy know if they wanted her to cover Hamlet’s deposition as well.\n\nThe next day, September 6, 2024, Sarena replied: their notice was attached as well and would be filed via CourtNet. Her note also included the Whaley Law Firm contact information: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and a reminder to note the new email address.\n\nIn sum, the communications document an ongoing, back-and-forth process to schedule the depositions of Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet for October 25, 2024. The plan was for Lang’s deposition to begin at 9:00 a.m., followed immediately by Hamlet’s deposition, with Scott Gowen hosting the deposition at his office. Notices to depose were to be filed with CourtNet, and Wendy Cotton was to cover Lang’s deposition (with the possibility of covering Hamlet’s deposition upon request). The parties also indicated the depositions would be conducted with the plaintiff Lang first and the defendant Hamlet second, and the notices would be issued promptly. The correspondence spanned July 15, 2024, through early September 2024, and included multiple cautions about outside-email content and standard procedural notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This is a sequence of email communications in the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter, focusing on scheduling deposition dates for Ms. Lang and Mr. Hamlet and the related notices and court-ordered coverage.\n\nThe exchange begins with a back-and-forth of deposition planning via The Whaley Law Firm and Scott Gowen. On April 9, 2024, at 3:53 PM, Gowen wrote to Bryce Koon asking, “How about Friday, October 25? I can depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 a.m. and Bryce can depose Mr. Hamlet immediately thereafter. Again, I am happy to host. Please let me know if this works for you guys and I will get a notice out.” Bryce replied at 4:04 PM, saying, “Scott, That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me.” The transmission included standard attorney-client privilege notices from Bryce Koon.\n\nMoving forward to July 15, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a message noting that, on July 15, 2024, they had requested deposition dates to depose Brenda Lang and, unfortunately, had not yet received a response. She requested dates that Mr. Gowen’s client would be available for deposition and specified a preference for dates in September, given their scheduling needs.\n\nBy August 27, 2024, Gowen acknowledged the lapse and explained he was out of town that week but would provide dates the following week. In a reply sent the same day, August 27, 2024 at 2:39 PM, Sarena reiterated that they had requested deposition dates on July 15 and had not yet received a response, urging Gowen to provide dates for his client’s deposition.\n\nGowen responded again on August 27, 2024 at 4:04 PM, apologizing for the delay and indicating he would furnish dates next week. The next day, August 28, 2024 at 9:43 AM, Sarena replied, saying, “Good morning Mr. Gowen, We completely understand. Thank you for the update.”\n\nOn September 4, 2024, at 11:34 AM, Sarena followed up with Gowen, noting they were “circling back” on the deposition scheduling from the previous week and asking Gowen to provide deposition dates once he had settled back in. Gowen replied on September 4, 2024 at 1:07 PM, proposing, “Will September 18 work? I can depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 and Bryce can depose Mr. Hamlet immediately after. I am happy to host.”\n\nSarena’s response came later that day, September 4, 2024 at 1:45 PM, stating, “Thank you so much. We are now pretty booked for September, however, we are open any day after October 1st.” Her signature followed, detailing The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; noting the email address as a new address.\n\nGowen then proposed a specific alternative on September 5, 2024 at 2:53 PM: “How about Friday, October 25? I can depose Ms. Lang beginning at 9:00 a.m. and Bryce can depose Mr. Hamlet immediately thereafter. Again, I am happy to host. Please let me know if this works for you guys and I will get a notice out.” Sarena responded at 3:13 PM the same day, writing, “That sounds perfect. Oct 25, 2024 starting at 9am w/PL immediately followed by Def at your office. We will get a notice over to you as well. Thank you so much.” Her message also included the Whaley Law Firm signature with the same contact details.\n\nBy September 5, 2024 at 3:50 PM, Gowen attached his deposition notice to Ms. Lang and, by copy of the email to court reporter Wendy Cotton, requested that she cover Lang’s deposition and asked that Wendy be informed if she should cover Hamlet’s deposition as well. Sarena confirmed the arrangement in a follow-up message on September 6, 2024 at 9:49:04 GMT-04:00, stating, “Thank you so much Mr. Gowen, Our notice is attached as well and will be filed via CourtNet momentarily.” Her signature again listed The Whaley Law Firm’s address, phone numbers, and her new email address.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the parties advanced a plan to depose Brenda Lang on October 25, 2024 at 9:00 a.m., with Marcus Hamlet to be deposed immediately thereafter at Gowen’s office, and with The Whaley Law Firm preparing and filing deposition notices via CourtNet. The discussions also touched on the involvement of the court reporter Wendy Cotton to cover Lang’s deposition and the possibility of coverage for Hamlet’s deposition, as directed by Gowen. The correspondence consistently referenced the need for depositions to occur in Louisville, with the parties coordinating host arrangements and notice delivery in the weeks leading up to the proposed date.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang.\n\nThis document records the sequence of email communications regarding the deposition schedule in Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet. The exchange began in 2024 and involved The Whaley Law Firm, specifically Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, and W. Bryce Koon, Esq., along with Scott Gowen, who appears to be counsel for the defendant, Marcus Hamlet. The parties discussed dates for deposing Brenda Lang (the plaintiff) and Marcus Hamlet (the defendant), with hosting arrangements and notices to be issued.\n\nOn September 5, 2024, at 3:12 p.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Scott Gowen, with Bryce Koon and Brenda Lang’s filevine email included in copy. In her message she stated, “That sounds perfect. Oct 25, 2024 starting at 9am w/PL immediately followed by Def at your office. We will get a notice over to you as well. Thank you so much.” She signed as Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971 and office line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and noted her new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The message was accompanied by her professional signature.\n\nEarlier on the same day,  Scott Gowen replied at 2:53 p.m., proposing a deposition on Friday, October 25, with Ms. Lang to be deposed at 9:00 a.m. and Bryce Koon to depose Mr. Hamlet immediately thereafter. Gowen stated he was happy to host and asked to be advised whether the date worked so he could issue a notice.\n\nThe thread also contains the preceding exchanges, beginning with Gowen’s September 4, 2024, 1:07 p.m. inquiry in which he asked whether September 18 would work, offering to depose Ms. Lang at 9:00 a.m. and have Bryce depose Mr. Hamlet immediately after, noting his willingness to host. In response, on September 4, 2024, at 11:34 a.m., Sarena Tuttle wrote back to Gowen, addressing him as “Mr. Gowen,” explaining that they were circling back on the matter from the prior week and hoping he had enjoyed his trip. She asked him to provide deposition dates as soon as he was settled back in.\n\nEarlier still, on August 28, 2024, at 9:43 a.m., Sarena Tuttle acknowledged Gowen’s update with, “Good morning Mr. Gowen, We completely understand. Thank you for the update.” And on August 27, 2024, at 4:04 p.m., Gowen responded that he was out of town that week and would provide dates the following week. In turn, on August 27, 2024, at 2:39 p.m., Sarena wrote that, as of July 15, 2024, they had requested dates to depose the defendant client and had yet to receive a response, asking Gowen to provide dates when his client would be available for deposition.\n\nThe chain shows a prior July 15, 2024 exchange in which Sarena noted the office was fairly open in September and could accommodate most Tuesdays, Wednesdays, or Thursdays after the 10th, requesting a narrowed set of dates from Gowen. The thread also reflects an earlier line of communication from April 2024. On April 9, 2024, Gowen asked Bryce Koon for an extension, requesting until the end of the month to serve responses and apologizing for the oversight and delay. Bryce replied later that same day, at 11:02 a.m., that after reviewing the file it appeared they had not received Gowen’s responses and that they would follow up. Gowen then replied at 3:53 p.m. requesting until the end of the month to serve the responses, to which Bryce responded at 4:04 p.m. with an acknowledgment that it was acceptable (the exact wording in that message reads, “That is okay with me. Thank you for getting back to me.”).\n\nThroughout these communications, multiple messages included the standard outside-sender caution banner indicating that the email originated outside Louisville Metro, advising recipients not to click links or open attachments unless the sender’s address and content were recognized as safe. These cautions appeared at various points in the threaded messages, including the September 4, 2024 and July 27–August 28, 2024 entries.\n\nIn sum, the record shows a protracted scheduling dialogue beginning in April 2024 and extending through September 2024, culminating in an agreed proposed deposition plan for October 25, 2024, with Brenda Lang’s deposition at 9:00 a.m., followed by Marcus Hamlet’s deposition immediately afterward, to be hosted at Gowen’s office, and with a notice to be issued to the opposing party. The participants consistently referenced coordinating notices, hosting arrangements, and the availability windows noted in their correspondence, while also noting periods when schedules were open or booked and the need to secure dates after October 1 and specifically targeting October 18, October 25, and other mid- to late-October slots as the case progressed.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda Lang MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This narrative covers a new deposition submission linked to the Brenda Lang motor vehicle accident case.\n\nOn October 24, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, sent a new scheduling submission from 20 Second Scheduler regarding the Brenda Lang case. In her message, she indicated that the deposition would involve only the deposition of Defendant Hamlet, and she noted that Wendy McLaughlin from the defense had been cc’d on their notice. Her contact details were included: Sarena Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (with a note to use the new email address).\n\nEarlier that same day, the Scheduling Department at Kentuckiana Reporters replied, asking for clarification: “Good morning! Are we also taking the depo of the plaintiff or just of Marcus Hamlet? Please advise.” This indicated that the team was unsure whether the plaintiff’s deposition would be included, and it referenced Marcus Hamlet as the defendant being considered for deposition.\n\nThe scheduling thread also displayed the Kentuckiana Reporters team’s standard contact information and policies. The Scheduling Team listed Kristina Calhoun, McKenna Watson, Rachel Walker, and Madison Elam, along with their phone number (502-589-2273), email (Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com), and address (730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202). They included a Cancellation Policy stating that a cancellation fee applies for assignments cancelled with less than 24 hours’ notice, and a note that interpreter requests cancelled within 24 hours of the appointment time will be billed at the industry standard of a 2-hour minimum rate.\n\nA prior email from Kentuckiana Reporters dated September 6, 2024, 10:14 AM, addressed to sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, stated: “Got it! We’ll get this added to our calendar & re-confirm 24 hours prior to the deposition. Thanks! McKenna.” This shows ongoing coordination about adding the deposition to the calendar and scheduling a 24-hour confirmation.\n\nAlso on September 6, 2024, a message from donotreply@kentuckianareporters.com (on behalf of donotreply@kentuckianareporters.com) conveyed the deposition details from Sarena Tuttle: the “Additional Comments” read, “Def Depo will be at 1p or Immediately Following Plaintiff - Plaintiff scheduled to start at 9am.” A Notice to Take Deposition file was attached: NTTD-Def-Hamlet-10.25.24.pdf.\n\nIn sum, the depositions are scheduled for October 25, 2024, with the plaintiff’s deposition set to start at 9:00 AM and the defendant’s deposition for Defendant Hamlet to begin at 1:00 PM or immediately following the plaintiff, depending on the plaintiff’s timeline. The notice to take deposition for the defendant Hamlet is referenced as NTTD-Def-Hamlet-10.25.24.pdf.",

Consequently, he asserts that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would be insufficient to resolve the matter.\n\nThe email communicates a willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on the documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering.

Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson County, 23-CI-005931). The subject line reflected the case, and the body began with a cordial greeting: “Good morning counsel,” followed by a brief request for any updates, and a closing with Koon’s contact information. The signature block identified The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. The email also carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient, that it may contain privileged information, and instructions regarding errors and forwarding.\n\nEarlier, on January 27, 2025, at approximately 12:17 p.m., Bryce Koon wrote to Mr. Gowen with a revised settlement demand for the above-referenced matter, noting that a revision with an attached demand had been provided. In that communication, Koon explained that all references to appendix-related issues and treatment had been removed. He acknowledged that there were still questions about the connection of those issues to the collision but stated that the removal was made to facilitate resolution and was offered as a good-faith concession. He emphasized that, even with those items removed, Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to injuries caused by the negligence of the opposing party. Consequently, he asserted that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would be insufficient to resolve the matter. He reaffirmed a willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on the documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering and asked for the recipient’s client to share their position after reviewing the revised demand and supporting materials. The message included a link to a Dropbox file: https://www.dropbox.com/t/ZMw14HaRDOYwjiY9. The email concluded with Koon’s signature and the same firm contact information as above, followed by the same attorney-client privilege disclaimer about intended recipients and protections against improper use or disclosure.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This matter is Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet in Jefferson County, case number 23-CI-005931.\n\nThe correspondence centers on a chain of emails from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, regarding the above-referenced matter. On January 27, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a message to Mr. Scott Gowen in the office of Louisville, Kentucky, with the subject that the message concerned a revised settlement demand for Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet. In that email, Koon advised that all references to appendix-related issues and treatment had been removed. He explained that, while there were still belief-based questions about the connection of those issues to the collision, the removal was intended as a good-faith effort to facilitate a resolution. He stated that Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to the injuries caused by the defendant’s negligence, and that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would not be sufficient to resolve the matter. Koon expressed a willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on the documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering, and he requested Mr. Gowen to review the revised demand and supporting materials and to inform him of the client’s position. He provided a Dropbox link to the revised materials: https://www.dropbox.com/t/ZMw14HaRDOYwjiY9. The message concluded with Koon’s signature block, including his name, title, the firm name, the firm’s Louisville address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), and contact numbers (Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207). Like the other messages, this email carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient, may contain privileged information, and that if received in error the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not use or forward the information; the same warning and instructions about privilege applied.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up with Mr. Gowen, emailing good morning counsel and asking for any updates, expressing appreciation for any information. This message again included the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of these communications, noting privileged or protected information and instructing anyone who received the message in error to contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the content.\n\nThen, on March 5, 2025, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up to counsel with the same subject matter: “Good afternoon counsel, Just circling back on this one again. Thanks.” This message opened with the same courtesy and identified the sender and firm in the signature block. It again contained the firm’s standard confidentiality disclaimer about attorney-client privilege and proper handling if received in error.\n\nAcross these emails, the communications demonstrate a continuing effort to move toward a settlement in Brenda Lang’s MVA case against Marcus Hamlet. The January 27, 2025 message outlined a revised settlement demand, the February 17, 2025 message sought updates, and the March 5, 2025 message issued another follow-up, all seeking resolution in light of the medical expenses Lang incurred and the related injuries. All messages were authored by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and circulated to Scott Gowen and to the Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 Filevine project email address, with the case caption and client identified as noted above.",

      "natural_language": "In the Brenda Lang motor-vehicle accident matter (Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021), Brenda Lang is the client, and the case is Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931). Beginning with a series of email exchanges in early 2025, the parties discussed settlement prospects and the scope of medicals tied to the collision.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a revised settlement demand to counsel for Marcus Hamlet. In that message, Koon stated that all references to appendix-related treatment and issues had been removed. He explained that, although there were still questions about the connection of those appendix-related items to the collision, the removal was meant to demonstrate good faith to facilitate resolution. He noted that Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to the injuries caused by the negligence of Hamlet, and that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would be insufficient to resolve the matter. Koon expressed willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on the documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering and asked the recipient to review the revised demand and supporting materials, including a Dropbox link. The message carried the standard confidentiality notice common to attorney communications and was signed with full contact details for The Whaley Law Firm. The email also referenced that the CC line included Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021’s Filevine project email address and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up with counsel, writing, “Good morning counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one again. Any updated appreciated,” reiterating the need for a response. This message also carried the firm’s standard confidentiality notice.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, another outside-email cautionary notice preceded Koon’s message, in which he again wrote, “Good afternoon counsel, Just circling back on this one again.” He included his contact details and the firm’s confidentiality notice.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Scott Gowen replied. He stated that he could not get to a settlement figure of $35,000 and that any settlement would need to include indemnity for the medicals, noting that most of the medical expenses were not even attributable to the accident. He indicated that he did not have authority to settle but that he would be willing to recommend Metro Government pay $10,000 subject to the execution of a release containing broad indemnity language. He added that he would only make that recommendation if Ms. Lang would accept that amount; otherwise, he suggested proceeding to trial.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Bryce Koon responded to Gowen, expressing that there appeared to be a misunderstanding. He stated that he had removed all references to appendix-related issues and treatment, and that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He asked whether Gowen’s position was that the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision, requesting an explanation if so, and offered to resend the records if needed. The message concluded with Koon’s signature and the firm’s confidentiality provisions.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the case details, the amount of medical expenses incurred, and the extent of indemnity language necessary for any proposed settlement, all within the framework of ongoing negotiations seeking a resolution without proceeding to trial.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This narrative covers the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter (Jefferson County, 23-CI-005931), focusing on a series of 2025 settlement communications between counsel.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a revised settlement demand to Scott Gowen regarding the above-referenced case. In that message, Bryce explained that he had removed all references to appendix-related issues and treatment from the demand. He noted that while there were still questions about the connection of those appendix-related items to the collision, the parties recognized the difficulty of litigating such matters. The removal was presented as a good-faith effort to facilitate a resolution. Bryce stated that even with those items removed, Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to the injuries caused by his client’s negligence, and that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would not be sufficient to resolve the matter. He expressed willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on the documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering, and he asked Gowen to review the revised demand and supporting materials. The email included a Dropbox link for the supporting documents and carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of such correspondence. It also contained a caution that the message originated outside Louisville Metro, advising recipients to exercise care with links and attachments, and reiterating that the information was intended only for the named recipient.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce followed up with Gowen, asking for any updates.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, Bryce sent another brief note to Gowen, again bridging the communication and reiterating the request for updates, while the message itself carried the customary external-email caution and confidentiality boilerplate.\n\nIn a reply dated March 7, 2025, Gowen acknowledged the difficulty in reaching a settlement and stated that he could not accept $35,000. He explained that any settlement would have to include an indemnity for the medicals, noting that many of the medical expenses were not attributable to the accident. Gowen indicated that he did not have authority to settle but would be willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10,000, subject to the execution of a release containing broad indemnity language. He emphasized that he would make that recommendation only if Ms. Lang would accept the amount; otherwise, he suggested proceeding to trial.\n\nFinally, on March 25, 2025, Bryce responded to Gowen's position, signaling a continued disagreement. He stated that he believed they were not on the same page and explained that he had removed any “questionably-related” treatment concerning Ms. Lang’s appendix. Bryce asked whether Gowen contends that the September 12, 2021 ER treatment was not related to the collision and requested an explanation if that was Gowen’s position. He also offered to resend the records if needed.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondence reflects the case details (Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Jefferson County, 23-CI-005931), the issue of whether certain medical treatments were connected to the collision, the removal of appendix-related treatment from the settlement demand, the claimed medical expenses (over $26,000), and the ongoing negotiation about a potential settlement versus trial. The discussions repeatedly reference the possibility of Metro Government paying a limited amount ($10,000) with broad indemnity language, contingent on Ms. Lang’s willingness to accept, and the alternative of proceeding to trial if a satisfactory resolution could not be reached.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021\nClient: Brenda Lang\n\n Brenda Lang, the client in the matter Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931), which stems from a motor vehicle accident on September 3, 2021, has been engaging in settlement discussions with counsel for Marcus Hamlet. The communications span January through March 2025 and involve the Whaley Law Firm, led by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and counsel for the opposing side, Scott Gowen.\n\n In a January 27, 2025 email, Bryce Koon sent a revised settlement demand to Scott Gowen, noting that he had removed all references to appendix-related issues and treatment. He acknowledged that while there were still questions about the connection of those appendix-related items to the collision, he understood the difficulty of litigating those points. Bryce emphasized that Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to the injuries from the collision, and stated that an offer in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 would not be sufficient to resolve the matter. He attached supporting materials, including a Dropbox link, and provided his contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-365-5043, fax 502-237-3207. The email also included the standard privilege disclaimer and noted that the message was intended only for the named recipient.\n\n On February 17, 2025, Bryce followed up again, requesting any updated position after reviewing the revised demand and supporting materials. The message, like the January 27 email, carried the outside-source caution and the same contact information for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\n On March 5, 2025 at 12:20 PM, Bryce sent another follow-up to Scott Gowen, again seeking guidance on the case status. The message reiterated the firm’s earlier position and asked for any updates.\n\n On March 7, 2025 at 9:22 AM, Scott Gowen replied. He stated that he could not reach $35,000 in a settlement and that any settlement would have to include indemnity for the medicals, most of which he believed were not even attributable to the accident. He added that he did not have formal authority but would be willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10,000, subject to the execution of a release containing broad indemnity language. Gowen noted, however, that he would only make that recommendation if Ms. Lang would accept that amount; otherwise, he suggested proceeding to trial.\n\n That same March 7 exchange was copied to Brenda Lang’s Filevine project email address and to Sarena Tuttle at the Whaley Law Firm.\n\n On March 25, 2025, Bryce responded with a direct rebuke of the current stance, explaining that the parties were not on the same page. He stated that he had removed all references to the appendix-related treatment from the demand and contended that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. Bryce asked Scott whether the 9/12/21 emergency room treatment was considered unrelated to the collision and requested clarification. He also offered to resend any records if needed.\n\n Finally, on March 26, 2025 at 14:55:52 UTC, Scott Gowen closed the loop with a concise note to Bryce: he understood Bryce’s position and suggested that it might be prudent to obtain a trial date so the matter could be progressed.\n\n In summary, the case has involved a long-running settlement dialogue centered on medical expenses (Ms. Lang’s medical bills exceed $26,000 and potentially align with the collision’s injuries), contested connections of certain treatment and appendix-related issues, and discussions about a potential, limited indemnity-driven settlement from Metro Government (around $10,000) versus proceeding to trial, with an initial position rejecting a $35,000 figure. The communications were shared among counsel for Ms. Lang (The Whaley Law Firm), counsel for Marcus Hamlet (Scott Gowen of the Metro Government), and Ms. Lang herself via the Filevine project, with copies to Sarena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang.\n\nRe: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931).\n\nThis matter involves Brenda Lang and Marcus Hamlet in Jefferson County, case number 23-CI-005931. The following is a narrative of the email communications about the case, beginning with the latest message and then detailing the preceding exchanges.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, at 02:18:09 GMT-04:00, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Scott Gowen, with copies to Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle. The subject was the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter. In the message, Koon stated that after reviewing the file, it appeared depositions of the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle would need to be taken. He asked Gowen to provide potential dates for those individuals and included his firm’s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer indicating it was intended only for the named recipient and warning that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not use or forward the information.\n\nEarlier communications in the thread unfolded as follows:\n\nOn March 26, 2025, at 10:56 AM (roughly), Scott Gowen replied to Bryce Koon, indicating that he understood Koon’s position and suggesting that it might make sense to set a trial date and “work this one up.”\n\nOn March 25, 2025, at 1:29 PM, Bryce Koon wrote back to Gowen. In this message, which included a caution note stating it originated from outside Louisville Metro, Koon expressed that he believed they were not on the same page. He had removed any “questionably-related” treatment concerning Ms. Lang’s appendix from the records, maintaining that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He asked whether Gowen’s position was that the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision and requested an explanation if that was the case; he offered to resend the records if needed. The message was signed with Bryce Koon’s contact information.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, at 9:22 AM, Gowen replied to Bryce Koon. He stated that he could not reach $35,000 and that any settlement would need to include indemnity for the medicals, most of which he believed were not attributable to the accident. He said he had no authority but would be willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10,000, subject to a release containing broad indemnity language. He noted that he would only make that recommendation if Koon could confirm that Ms. Lang would accept that amount; otherwise, he suggested they should proceed to trial.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, at 12:20 PM, Bryce Koon sent a reply to Gowen (with Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address copied). The message, which included the standard external-email caution, began with “Good afternoon counsel” and stated that he was circling back on the matter again. It concluded with a brief sign-off containing his contact details.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, at 10:23 AM, Bryce Koon sent another message to Gowen. He wrote, “Good morning counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one. Any updated appreciated. Thank you,” and again provided his contact information.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, at 12:17 PM, Bryce Koon sent a revised settlement demand to Gowen. He explained that all references to appendix-related issues and treatment had been removed, while acknowledging there were still valid questions about the connection of those issues to the collision. He recognized the difficulty of litigating such matters but described the removal as a good-faith effort to facilitate a resolution. He noted that, even with those items removed, Ms. Lang had incurred more than $26,000 in medical expenses directly related to the injuries caused by Mr. Hamlet’s negligence. He stated that an offer in the range of $5,000–$10,000 would not be sufficient to resolve the matter and expressed willingness to discuss a reasonable resolution based on documented medical expenses and Ms. Lang’s pain and suffering. He asked Gowen to let them know Metro Government’s position after reviewing the revised demand and supporting materials. The message included a Dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/t/ZMw14HaRDOYwjiY9. The email concluded with Bryce Koon’s signature and firm contact information, along with the standard disclaimer about attorney-client privilege and external email.\n\nThe April 29, 2025 message, referenced at the start of this narrative, was sent in the context of ongoing negotiations, with a focus on obtaining dates for depositions of other passengers and continuing to manage the litigation strategy in Brenda Lang’s favor. The thread shows a persistent effort to settle through indemnity-based releases and to address the admissibility and relevance of medical expenses tied to the collision, while exploring trial options if a settlement could not be achieved. The correspondence also reflects routine preservation of privilege notices and external-email cautions across the communications.",

      "natural_language": "In the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter (Jefferson 23-CI-005931), the case team carried on a series of settlement and discovery discussions from January through May of 2025. The proceedings centered on settlement posture, the scope of medical-related demands, and plans to depose potential witnesses and other passengers involved in the collision.\n\nOn January 27, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a revised settlement demand regarding the above-referenced matter. He noted that all references to appendix-related issues had been removed and that the remainder of the demand addressed the issues identified in the demand by treating the medicals as related to the collision. The email included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, and the message indicated the revised demand was attached. The set of recipients included Scott Gowen from Louisville Metro Government, with copies to Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle, among others.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up, asking for any updates on the matter. No substantive changes to positions were recorded in the note, but the outreach reflected ongoing interest in progress.\n\nBy March 5, 2025, Koon again contacted Gowen, stating that he believed the two sides remained out of alignment. He explained that he had removed any “questionably-related” treatment regarding Ms. Lang’s appendix, and he asserted that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He asked Gowen to indicate if the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision and offered to resend the records if needed. The message carried the external-email caution typical of communications from outside Louisville Metro.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Gowen replied that he could not reach a $35,000 settlement and that any settlement would need to include indemnity for the medicals, most of which he contended were not attributable to the accident. He stated he did not have authority to approve a settlement, but was willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10,000, subject to the execution of a release with broad indemnity language. He emphasized that this recommendation depended on Ms. Lang’s acceptance, and otherwise suggested proceeding to trial.\n\nThe exchange continued on March 25, 2025, with Koon responding that he believed there remained a misunderstanding. He stated that he had removed the “questionably-related” appendix issues and that the remainder of the medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He again asked Gowen to explain whether the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision, offering to resend the records if needed.\n\nGowen followed up on March 26, 2025, suggesting that it might make sense to set a trial date and proceed with preparing the case toward trial rather than continuing the current settlement discussion.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, Koon wrote that, after reviewing the file, they would need to depose the other passengers in Ms. Lang’s vehicle and asked Gowen to provide potential dates for those depositions.\n\nFinally, on May 5, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a message to Gowen stating, “We are looking to depose Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight.” Gowen replied later that morning, asking Koon to identify exactly who he wanted to depose and to confirm that those individuals were still employed by Metro Government. The May 5 emails continued to carry the same privilege notices and recipient lists found in the prior messages, with copies to Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nAcross the chain, the notices reflect the ongoing effort to coordinate depositions of specific individuals (the initial three named in the May 5 email and, subsequently, the other passengers) while simultaneously negotiating a potential settlement that balances indemnity language and the attribution of medical expenses. The signature blocks consistently show The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the standard attorney contact information, and the messages include customary cautions about outside emails and privileged information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021\nClient: Brenda Lang\n\nRe: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931)\n\nThis matter concerns Brenda Lang and her automobile-accident case against Marcus Hamlet, docketed in Jefferson County as 23-CI-005931. The following narrative summarizes the email communications among counsel and the parties from February through May 2025.\n\nOn February 17, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to counsel regarding the Lang v. Hamlet matter, stating, “Good morning counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one. Any updated appreciated.” The message included Koon’s contact details and a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and warning against disclosure if received in error.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, at 12:20 PM, Bryce Koon again wrote to Scott Gowen with Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address cc’d to Sarena Tuttle. In this outside-Louville Metro email, Koon said, “Good afternoon counsel, Just circling back on this one again,” and signed with his firm’s contact information. A CAUTION notice warned that the email originated outside Louisville Metro.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, at 9:22 AM, Gowen replied, telling Bryce that he could not reach $35,000 in settlement and that any settlement would need to include indemnity for medicals, the majority of which, he claimed, were not attributable to the accident. Gowen stated he did not have authority but was willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10,000 subject to the execution of a release with broad indemnity language, provided Lang would accept that amount; otherwise, the parties would proceed toward a trial date. This reply also included a standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, at 1:29 PM, Bryce Koon responded to Gowen, again including Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle in CC. He expressed that he believed they were not on the same page, noting that he had removed “any of the ‘questionably-related’ treatment regarding Ms. Lang’s appendix” and that the remaining medicals, as identified in the demand, were clearly related to the collision. He asked Gowen to explain if the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision and offered to resend records if needed. The message carried the standard outside-email CAUTION.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, at 10:56 AM, Gowen replied to Bryce, acknowledging Bryce’s position and suggesting that it might make sense to obtain a trial date and develop the case from there. The message concluded with Gowen’s sign-off, followed by the typical disclaimer about privileged or protected information.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, at 2:18 PM, Bryce Koon wrote to Gowen with Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 – Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle copied in. He reported that, after reviewing the file, it appeared they would need to depose the other passengers in Lang’s vehicle and asked Gowen to provide potential dates for those individuals. The message included the standard outside-email caution.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, there were two key exchanges. At 9:15 AM, Gowen replied to Bryce, apologizing for the late response and asking Bryce to identify exactly who he wanted to depose so he could check whether those individuals were still employed by Metro Government. Bryce’s response requested the depositions of Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight. This May 5 message from Bryce stated the deposition targets explicitly and was accompanied by his firm’s signature block, including address, phone, and fax, as well as a confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe May 5 exchange also reflects the ongoing discovery posture in the case, including a focus on depositions of individuals connected to Lang Lang v. Hamlet, with the primary objective of setting depositions for the potential witnesses named by Bryce Koon, Esq.\n\nIn summary, the thread from February through May 2025 shows ongoing settlement negotiations centered on indemnity for medicals and a dispute over the appropriate settlement amount, a proposal to move forward with a trial date, and a clear discovery plan that included deposing the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle and, later, specifically deposing Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight, as the case progressed toward trial. The correspondence repeatedly involves The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon, Esq.), Scott Gowen (Metro Government counsel), Brenda Lang (the plaintiff), and Sarena Tuttle, with standard confidentiality cautions included in the outgoing emails.",

      "natural_language": "The Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet case (Jefferson 23-CI-005931) involves client Brenda Lang, with the case file titled Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. The communications in the record show a sequence of emails between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Scott Gowen of Louisville Metro, with Brenda Lang’s Filevine project email address copied on certain messages. The latest entry is a follow-up from May 21, 2025.\n\nThe first dated entry in the thread occurs on February 17, 2025, when Bryce Koon wrote to counsel, “Good morning counsel, Wanted to follow up on this one. Any updated appreciated.” The message includes the standard confidentiality disclaimer common to The Whaley Law Firm emails, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged information; recipients who receive it in error should contact the firm and should not use or forward the information. A caution that the message originated outside Louisville Metro is also included in the record.\n\nOn March 5, 2025, Bryce Koon sent another message: “Good afternoon counsel, Just circling back on this one again.” This message, too, carried the outside-LouVolle Metro caution and the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Scott Gowen replied: “Bryce, Sorry for the delay in responding. I cannot get to $35K. And any settlement would have to include indemnity for the medicals, most of which are not even attributable to the accident. I do not have any authority, but would be willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $10K subject to the execution of a release containing broad indemnity language. But I am only willing to make that recommendation if you tell me that Ms. Lang will accept that amount. Otherwise, I guess we just need to get a trial date.” This message also includes the standard confidentiality disclaimer and the outside‑the‑Metro caution.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Bryce Koon responded: “I'm sorry Scott, but I guess I am missing something here as we are not on the same page. I have removed any of the ‘questionably-related’ treatment regarding Ms. Lang's appendix. The remainder of the medicals, as identified in the demand, are clearly related to the collision. Is it your position that the 9/12/21 ER treatment was not related to the collision? If that is the case, please explain. If you need me to resend these records, please let me know.” This message again carries the outside‑Louisville caution and the standard disclaimer.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Gowen replied: “Bryce, I understand your position. Perhaps it makes sense to get a trial date and we can work this one up.” The message includes the usual confidentiality notice and outside‑Metro caution.\n\nThen, on April 29, 2025, Bryce Koon wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, After reviewing this file, it appears we will need to take the depositions of the other passengers in your client's vehicle. Are you able to provide potential dates for any of those individuals?” This email had the external-caution disclaimer and the confidentiality notice, and it CC’ed Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address, as well as Sarena Tuttle.\n\nNext, on May 5, 2025, there were two messages. The first, at about 9:15 AM, was from Scott Gowen: “Bryce, Sorry for the late response. Please identify exactly who you want to take and I will check to see if they are still employed by Metro Government.” The message again contained the customary confidentiality disclaimer and the outside‑Louisville caution. A few minutes later, Bryce Koon replied: “Good morning counsel, We are looking to depose Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight.” This reply also included the same disclaimers and caution.\n\nFinally, on May 21, 2025, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up to counsel: “Good morning counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this. Thanks,” signed with his name and title from The Whaley Law Firm, The message again carried the confidentiality disclaimer and the standard outside‑Louisville Metro caution.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the record reflects a focus on scheduling depositions (specifically of Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, Eric Knight, and the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle) and ongoing negotiations regarding settlement amounts and indemnity for medicals, as well as consideration of trial timing. The thread includes multiple CCs to Brenda Lang’s Filevine address and notes the involvement of Sarena Tuttle in some communications. Each email contains a confidential attorney‑client disclaimer and a caution about outside communication.",

      "natural_language": "In the Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet matter (Jefferson 23-CI-005931), Brenda Lang is the client in a motor vehicle accident case designated as Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. The following narrative summarizes the email correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and Scott Gowen, counsel for Louisville Metro Government, from early 2025 through June 30, 2025, including the ongoing deposition and settlement discussions.\n\nOn March 7, 2025, Scott Gowen replied to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm. Gowen stated that he could not reach a settlement of $35,000 and that any settlement would have to include indemnity for the medicals, most of which he argued were not attributable to the accident. He indicated he had no authority to authorize a higher amount but suggested Metro Government might pay $10,000 subject to a release containing broad indemnity language, provided Brenda Lang would accept that amount; otherwise, he suggested we proceed toward a trial date.\n\nA week later, on March 25, 2025, Bryce Koon responded. He explained that, after reviewing the file, it appeared the depositions of the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle would be required. He asked Scott Gowen to provide potential dates for those individuals. He also noted that he had previously removed “any of the ‘questionably-related’ treatment” regarding Lang’s appendix, and that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He asked whether the 9/12/21 emergency room treatment was considered unrelated to the collision and requested an explanation if that were the case; he offered to resend records if needed.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Gowen replied that it might make sense to obtain a trial date and to work the case up toward that end.\n\nIn a message dated April 29, 2025, Bryce Koon wrote that, after reviewing the file, it appeared the parties would need to depose the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle, and he asked Scott Gowen for potential deposition dates for those individuals.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Bryce indicated in a message that the team was looking to depose Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight. Gowen responded by asking Bryce to identify exactly who he wished to depose and said he would check to confirm whether those individuals were still employed by Metro Government.\n\nAlso on May 5, 2025, the messages included standard attorney-client privilege disclaimers: Bryce’s message, and Gowen’s response, each noted that the electronic communications were intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information, with instructions to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error and not to disclose or forward content to unintended recipients.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, Bryce sent a follow-up email titled Re: Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931). The email carried a caution notice indicating it originated outside Louisville Metro and reiterated the privilege disclaimer language commonly included in such communications. The body simply stated, “Good morning counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this. Thanks,” with Bryce’s contact information and firm details.\n\nTwo days later, on May 27, 2025, Scott Gowen replied that he was still verifying whether the proposed deponents—presumably Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight—remained employed by Metro Government, and he anticipated having an answer today or tomorrow.\n\nFinally, on June 30, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a follow-up that stated, “Counsel, Wanted to follow up on this and if any of these individuals are available. In the meantime, we are prepared to reduce our demand to $30,000 for full and final settlement of this claim.” The email was sent from Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm’s phone and fax numbers listed, and it was addressed to Scott Gowen with a copy to the Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021 Filevine project email address. The message included the standard protective disclaimer about privileged information and instructed that, if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not use or forward the information.\n\nIn summary, the case overview shows ongoing deposition planning (including Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, Eric Knight, and other passengers) and a shift in settlement posture from a prior target in the high-30s to an expressed willingness to settle for $30,000, contingent upon the availability of the named individuals and the terms of a full and final release with indemnity provisions.",

      "natural_language": "Between March 2025 and July 2025, counsel in Brenda Lang’s motor vehicle collision case with Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson County, case 23-CI-005931) exchanged a series of email updates. The case is identified in these notes as Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet (Jefferson 23-CI-005931), with Brenda Lang as the client. The communications below involve W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Scott Gowen of Louisville Metro Government, with several emails including a Filevine project CC for Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021. Each message carried the standard attorney‑client privilege disclaimer stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be forwarded if received in error, and, in several instances, a caution that the email originated from outside Louisville Metro.\n\nThe first entry (July 21, 2025) shows Bryce Koon following up on the case and asking Scott Gowen for any update. The message is brief: “Following up on this. Any update appreciated.” It includes Bryce’s signature and the firm’s contact details, along with the customary privilege disclaimer, and a separate note indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be used or forwarded if received in error. The email also includes a Filevine CC line referencing Brenda Lang MVA 09/03/2021.\n\nEarlier, on June 30, 2025, Bryce wrote to counsel with a substantive update: they were following up and asking whether certain individuals were available, and in the meantime, they were prepared to reduce their demand to $30,000 for a full and final settlement of the claim. This message also carries the standard privilege disclaimer and the outside-email caution in the body of the message.\n\nOn May 27, 2025, Scott Gowen replied that he was still verifying that each of the named individuals were still employed by Metro Government and that he should know something today or tomorrow. This message also included the privilege disclaimer and the outside-email caution.\n\nThe May 21, 2025 correspondence from Bryce Koon to Gowen (with Brenda Lang’s Filevine CC) is a follow-up note that continues the thread of inquiry, and again includes the “CAUTION: This email came from outside of Louisville Metro” notice. It carries the same privilege disclaimer as the other messages.\n\nEarlier still, on May 5, 2025, Bryce wrote that they intended to depose Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight. Scott Gowen’s response that day asked Bryce to identify exactly who he wanted to depose so he could check whether those individuals remained employed by Metro Government. The reply from Bryce confirms the intended deponents and maintains the same formal email structure and privilege notice.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, in a prior exchange, Gowen instructed Bryce to specify precisely who should be deposed and indicated he would verify employment status. Bryce then indicated the specific deponents he wished to depose.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, Bryce advised that after reviewing the file, it appeared depositions of the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle would be necessary, and he requested potential dates for those individuals. The message also included the standard privilege disclaimer and the outside-email caution.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Gowen suggested that it might make sense to set a trial date and work the case up from there, signaling a shift toward trial planning.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Bryce responded to Gowen, expressing confusion about a disagreement on the relatedness of medical records. He explained that he had removed any “questionably-related” treatment regarding Ms. Lang’s appendix and asserted that the remaining medicals identified in the demand were clearly related to the collision. He asked whether the 9/12/21 emergency room treatment was not related to the collision and requested that Gowen explain if that was the case; he offered to resend the records if needed. The March 25 message also carried the usual privilege disclaimer and a caution about outside email origin.\n\nAcross these messages, the topic centers on discovery planning (depositions of certain witnesses, including other passengers in the vehicle), a potential settlement posture (the June 30, 2025 update reduces the demand to $30,000 for full and final settlement), and ongoing disputes over the relationship of medical records to the collision, with a thread of confirming which witnesses remain employed by Metro Government. The emails repeatedly note that the content is confidential and privileged, warn recipients about outside-origin emails, and include standard firm contact information and Filevine project references.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Brenda-Lang-MVA-09-03-2021. Client: Brenda Lang. This matter is Brenda Lang v. Marcus Hamlet, Jefferson County case 23-CI-005931, involving a motor vehicle accident originally noted on March 9, 2021 (Brenda Lang MVA). The following is a narrative of the communications and settlement/discovery discussions among counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and related parties, centered on potential settlement with Metro Government and depositions of various individuals.\n\nThe chronology begins with March 26, 2025, when Scott Gowen of Metro Government suggested that it might make sense to set a trial date and “work this one up,” signaling openness to moving toward resolution but not yet committing to any particular figure or release terms. On April 29, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied that, after reviewing the file, the parties would likely need to depose the other passengers in Brenda Lang’s vehicle and asked for potential dates for those individuals.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Bryce again pressed for depositions, stating that Lang’s side intended to depose Wendel Smith, Marcus Cheaton, and Eric Knight, and Scott Gowen responded later that morning, requesting that Bryce identify exactly who they wished to depose so he could verify whether those individuals were still employed by Metro Government. A week later, on May 21, 2025, Bryce followed up for an update. On May 27, 2025, Gowen replied that he was still verifying the employment status of the individuals and expected to have information within a day or two.\n\nBy June 30, 2025, Bryce indicated that Lang’s side was prepared to reduce its demand to $30,000 for a full and final settlement of the claim, and he asked again which individuals could be deposed, seeking potential dates for those depositions, and noting that the other passengers in Lang’s vehicle would need to be deposed as well.\n\nIn July 2025, discussions shifted to a potential settlement with Metro Government. On July 21, 2025, Bryce sent a message acknowledging the ongoing discussions and seeking updates. On July 23, 2025, Gowen replied, stating that while he did not currently have authority, he would be willing to recommend that Metro Government pay $15,000, provided there was a release containing broad indemnity language and only if Ms. Lang would accept that amount. He asked Bryce to confirm whether Lang was interested in that proposition. Bryce then responded on July 24, 2025, at 10:42 AM, asking for thoughts and expressing doubt that Lang would agree to a $15,000 settlement. Later the same day, at 11:41 AM, Aaron Whaley, counsel for Lang, weighed in on the matter by asking whether the appendix to the medical records should be excluded from consideration and, if the appendix is excluded, what the total medicals would be; he also sought Lang’s confirmation that she considers the appendix to be unrelated.\n\nThroughout this sequence, the messages include the standard outside-email caution notices about the sender’s address and privilege, with boilerplate confidentiality language affirming that the communications are intended for the named recipients and advising on handling if received in error. The parties’ communications reflect a pattern of ongoing discovery planning (depositions of named individuals and of other passengers in Lang’s vehicle) alongside ongoing settlement discussions with Metro Government, including a potential settlement at $30,000, then a later proposal of $15,000 conditioned on a broad indemnity release and Lang’s acceptance. The case remains active with the plaintiff’s representation by The Whaley Law Firm and involvement from Metro Government counsel.",
