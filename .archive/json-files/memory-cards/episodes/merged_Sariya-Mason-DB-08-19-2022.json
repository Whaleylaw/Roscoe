He noted that a Word copy was included for convenience and invited any questions. The body of the email included a standard confidentiality disclaimer, indicating the message was intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or otherwise protected information; it instructed that if the message or attachments were received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose the information.\n\nThe email was sent to Deanna M. Tucker, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d. Bryce’s signature block followed, listing The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the same phone and fax numbers as above.\n\nIn a reply later the same day, at 3:13 PM, Deanna M. Tucker—identified in the signature as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner at her firm—acknowledged receipt and requested that her legal assistant be included on future emails. She wrote, “Bryce, Received. If you could include my legal assistant, Kristy King, on emails, that would be appreciated. I have copied her on this email.” Her signature block provided her firm’s address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, with direct phone number 502.625.1671 and direct fax 502.779.9329.

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). Client: Sariya Mason. The file is labeled Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022.\n\nIn December 2023, the matter included a communications thread between The Whaley Law Firm and the opposing counsel. On December 7, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Deanna M. Tucker with the subject Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). He attached Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed that day, and stated that a Word copy was included for convenience. He identified himself and provided the firm’s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email also included the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nDeanna Tucker replied later that day: “Bryce, Received. If you could include my legal assistant, Kristy King, on emails, that would be appreciated. I have copied her on this email.” She signed as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, with the firm’s Louisville address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; direct phone 502-625-1671; direct fax 502-779-9329. She also included the usual confidentiality notice stating the message is for the named recipient and may be attorney-client or work-product privileged, and that if received in error the recipient should notify the sender and destroy the message.\n\nFollowing Deanna’s request, Bryce responded: “Will do.” This brief reply was sent on December 7, 2023, to acknowledge that Kristy King would be included on future communications. The exchange—like the prior message—carried The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details and the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThen, on January 18, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another email regarding discovery in the same case to Deanna Tucker, with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King copied. He reported that the responses to the requests for admission had been received, but the responses to the interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He requested to know when those remaining responses might be expected. The email included his standard signature with the Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville address and contact numbers (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363) and again carried the confidentiality notice.\n\nIn summary, the December 7, 2023 filing established Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and its notice, followed by acknowledgment and a request to include Kristy King in future communications; and on January 18, 2024, the team followed up to note that admissions responses had been received while interrogatories and document production remained outstanding and to request a timeline for those remaining responses.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note documents discovery communications in the matter Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case number 23-CI-006039.\n\nThe communications originate from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, and were sent to Deanna M. Tucker (with several colleagues copied) over a period spanning December 2023 to January 2024. The file shows a consistent pattern of follow-up on outstanding discovery responses in the Jefferson County case.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, Bryce Koon emailed Deanna Tucker to transmit Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed that day. He advised that a Word copy of the discovery material was included for convenience and asked counsel to review and let him know if there were any questions. The Whaley Law Firm signature in this message lists 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. Additionally, the email included a standard confidentiality notice indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged information, with instructions should the message have been received in error.\n\nDeanna Tucker replied on December 7, 2023, at 3:13 PM, acknowledging receipt and requesting that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on emails going forward; she noted that she had copied Kristy on the email. Tucker’s signature in this chain identifies her as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, with an office at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. Her direct phone is 502.625.1671 and her direct fax is 502.779.9329. A confidentiality notice was included in the exchange, stating the communication is privileged and should be treated accordingly if received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:56 PM, Bryce had written to Deanna Tucker with a brief: “Good afternoon counsel,” and advised that Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery had been attached, along with a Word copy for convenience. He also noted that he would “will do” regarding including Ms. King on future emails, in response to Tucker’s request.\n\nThe next message in the thread, at 3:15 PM on December 7, 2023, shows Deanna Tucker replying with the acknowledgment “Will do,” confirming her amendment to include Kristy King on communications.\n\nMoving forward to January 18, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up to Deanna Tucker. He stated that he wished to follow up on the discovery requests served in the matter and noted that, so far, the responses appeared to include answers to the requests for admission, but the responses to interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He asked Deanna to advise when such responses could be expected. This January 18 message also includes the standard firm signature for The Whaley Law Firm, repeating the Louisville address, phone, and fax numbers, along with the confidentiality notice.\n\nFinally, on January 31, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another concise follow-up to Deanna Tucker. He wrote to again request information on the outstanding discovery responses and asked that she advise when they may be expected. This email again carried the standard Whaley Law Firm signature block and confidentiality notice.\n\nAcross the thread, the communications consistently reference the case caption Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case 23-CI-006039. The correspondence also reflects standard attorney‑client privilege notices and the practice of including Kristy M. King, Deanna Tucker’s requested legal assistant, on email communications. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details appear in the signatures, with minor variations in fax numbers between messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya Mason, case file Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note records discovery-related communications in the matter of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039.\n\nThe series of emails began with a December 7, 2023 message from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207). In that message, he attached Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the notice filed that day, noting that a Word copy was included for the recipient’s convenience and inviting any questions. The message was sent to Deanna M. Tucker, with a copy to Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King, and the subject line identified the case. The body of the email stated, “Attached please find Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed today. A word copy is included for your convenience. If you have any questions, please let me know.” The message included the standard attorney-client/privilege disclaimers common to electronic correspondence.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 3:13 PM on December 7, 2023, Deanna M. Tucker replied. She asked that Bryce please include her legal assistant, Kristy King, on emails and noted that she had copied Kristy on the exchange. The signature block identified Tucker as a partner located at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, with direct phone 502-625-1671 and direct fax 502-779-9329. The message also contained a confidentiality notice, indicating the communication and any attachments were intended only for the recipient(s) named and may be subject to attorney-client and/or work product privileges.\n\nLater the same afternoon, at 3:15 PM, Bryce Koon replied, indicating “Will do.” The exchange at that time carried the same general subject matter and the same discovery documents and intent.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, at 3:18 PM, Bryce Koon again followed up with Deanna Tucker regarding the discovery requests. He noted that, while answers to the requests for admission appeared to have been received, responses to the interrogatories and to the production of documents remained outstanding, and he asked when those responses could be expected. The message again carried the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nA few days later, on January 31, 2024, at 1:08 PM, Koon sent another follow-up. He stated he was writing to again pursue the outstanding discovery responses and asked Deanna Tucker to advise when those responses may be expected. The note included the attorney’s contact information and the same confidential-disclaimer language.\n\nThen, on February 14, 2024, at 4:09 PM, Koon sent a final follow-up to counsel. He acknowledged that the parties had been attempting for some time to obtain responses to the interrogatories and the requests for production of documents previously served. He stated that, while he did not wish to engage in extraneous litigation, if there was no response by this time next week, they would be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard. The message again included The Whaley Law Firm’s professional contact information and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the communications repeatedly reference the same active matter: Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039. The note reflects ongoing efforts to obtain full discovery responses (interrogatories and production of documents), with occasional partial responses (notably admissions) and repeated follow-ups over a period extending from December 2023 through February 2024. The law firm contact details for The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) appear in the December 7, 2023 and February 14, 2024 messages. Deanna M. Tucker’s responses consistently indicate the need to include her legal assistant (Kristy M. King) on communications, a request Tucker conveyed in her December 7, 2023 reply.\n\nIn sum, the record shows a back-and-forth sequence of discovery-related emails beginning with the December 7, 2023 transmission of Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery, followed by multiple follow-ups in January 2024 and a further reminder in February 2024, with counsel warning of a possible motion to compel if the outstanding interrogatories and document productions are not addressed within a stated timeframe.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). Client: Sariya Mason. This narrative summarizes the email correspondence between counsel handling the matter and traces discovery and motion scheduling activity in the case.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, at 16:33:49 (UTC-05:00), W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Deanna M. Tucker, Esq., with copies to Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King. He stated, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today and set for next Monday’s motion hour.” The message included Koon’s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm—712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-365-5043, fax 502-364-9363—and a standard attorney-client privilege confidentiality notice indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and warning against sharing or using the information if received in error. The same day, the thread shows the ongoing pattern of discovery-related communications between the parties, with the expectation that the attached filing would be addressed during the upcoming motion hour the following Monday.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on February 14, 2024, at 16:09 (UTC-05:00), Koon wrote to Deanna M. Tucker, stating, “As you can see below, we have been attempting for some time now to obtain responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents we previously served. While I do not wish for any extraneous litigation, if we do not hear back from you by this time next week we will be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard.” He concluded with his standard firm signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nThe record also includes an earlier follow-up from January 31, 2024, at 13:08 (UTC-05:00), in which Koon wrote, “Good afternoon Deanna, I am writing to again follow up on the outstanding discovery responses. Please advise when these may be expected.” The January 31 message was accompanied by Koon’s firm contact details and the usual confidentiality language.\n\nPrior to that, on January 18, 2024, at 15:18 (UTC-05:00), Koon sent a message: “Good afternoon Deanna, Just wanted to follow up on the discovery requests served in this regard. It appears we have received answers to the requests for admission but the responses to interrogatories and production of documents remain outstanding. Please advise when we may expect such responses.” The message again carried Koon’s signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nThe chain includes December 7, 2023, at 3:15 PM, in which Koon replied simply, “Will do.” The preceding December 7, 2023, at 3:13 PM, shows Deanna M. Tucker replying to Bryce Koon, requesting that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on emails and noting that she had copied Kristy on the email.\n\nEarlier still, on December 7, 2023, at 2:56 PM, Koon wrote, “Attached please find Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed today. A word copy is included for your convenience. If you have any questions, please let me know.” The email carried The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and the standard confidentiality boilerplate.\n\nIn December 2023, Deanna M. Tucker’s reply — dated December 7, 2023 at 3:13 PM — confirmed receipt and requested that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on emails, noting she had copied Kristy on the current exchange and reiterating confidentiality of the communications.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the central issues have been discovery-related: the plaintiffs’ counsel (W. Bryce Koon, Esq.) has been seeking responses to interrogatories and requests for production of documents, with explicit reminders that failure to respond could lead to a motion to compel; the record also shows that the plaintiff filed a First Set of Discovery, including a notice, in December 2023, and that communications continued into February 2024 regarding the status of discovery responses and scheduling of motions.\n\nThis case concerns Sariya Mason as the plaintiff against Surelis Castillo and others, in Jefferson County Circuit Court, docket 23-CI-006039. The parties’ correspondence reflects ongoing discovery efforts and the procedural step of setting a motion hour for a forthcoming filing, with multiple follow-ups aimed at obtaining timely responses to discovery requests and avoiding unnecessary litigation through proactive resolution of discovery disputes.",

In the message, Lonergan states that the client is Serse Thomas and that, on behalf of Sarah Mason, a motion to compel had been filed for Monday. He asks whether the proposed order you tendered provides 14 days from the date of the order to obtain the discovery responses, and notes that his side is working on the responses and almost has them done. He indicates an expectation of delivering them well before that deadline, but explains a language barrier with their client and that they are currently short-handed. Lonergan adds that his team is in all-day mediation on Monday and asks if you would be willing to sign an agreed order giving them until March 11 to complete the discovery responses. He clarifies that this is 14 days from the 26th, which would be the motion hour, and asks you to call him back at his direct line, 526-25-1678.

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case 23-CI-006039, a follow-up email was sent on January 18, 2024. W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Deanna M. Tucker, with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King copied on the thread, to address the status of discovery requests in the case. He noted that answers to the requests for admission had been received, but the responses to the interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding, and he asked Deanna to advise when such responses could be expected. The email included counsel contact details for The Whaley Law Firm—712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 364-9363—and carried the standard attorney-client confidentiality disclaimers typical of the firm.\n\nThis January 18, 2024 email followed a prior exchange dated December 7, 2023. In the earlier communications, Bryce Koon sent out Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery along with the associated notice filed that day, noting that a Word copy of the set was included for convenience. The email was addressed to Deanna M. Tucker and copied to Sarena Tuttle, with the subject line identifying the same case (Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). The message stated that a Word copy was included and invited any questions.\n\nDeanna M. Tucker responded later on December 7, 2023, at 3:13 PM, asking that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on future emails and noting that she had copied Kristy on the email. Tucker signed as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, a Partner, and provided her contact information: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1671; Direct Fax: 502.779.9329. Her message also contained the firm’s confidentiality notice, indicating the communication and attachments were intended for the named recipient(s) and protected by attorney-client and work product privileges, with instructions on what to do if received in error.\n\n Bryce Koon replied to Tucker at 3:15 PM on December 7, 2023 with a simple confirmation, “Will do,” indicating he would include Kristy King on future communications as Tucker requested. This exchange, like the prior one, was accompanied by the standard confidentiality disclaimer stating that the message may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information and advising the recipient to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message was received in error and not to disclose or forward it.\n\nIn summary, the case note documents a January 18, 2024 follow-up confirming that admissions responses had been received but that interrogatories and document production responses were still outstanding; it also recounts the December 7, 2023 sequence in which Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery was sent, Tucker’s request to include Kristy King on emails, and Bryce Koon’s acknowledgment of that request. The correspondence includes the parties’ contact details and the confidentiality and privilege notices that accompanied each email.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. in Jefferson Circuit Court, 23-CI-006039. The client is Sariya Mason, and the file is labeled Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. The record consists of a chain of email communications between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Deanna M. Tucker, a partner at SBMK Law, with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King copied on various messages.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, at 2:56 p.m., Bryce Koon sent Deanna Tucker a message attaching Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the notice filed that day, noting that a Word copy was included for her convenience. The email also contained The Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality notice. The CC line included Sarena Tuttle, and Kristy M. King was cc’d in subsequent correspondence.\n\nDeanna Tucker replied at 3:13 p.m. on the same day, requesting that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on emails and noting that she had copied Kristy on the email. She signed as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, with the Louisville, Kentucky address and direct contact details, and the message also carried the confidentiality notice.\n\nBryce Koon responded shortly thereafter at 3:15 p.m. with a brief \"Will do,\" and his signature block again listed The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information.\n\nIn the following month, on January 18, 2024, at 3:18 p.m., Koon again wrote to Deanna Tucker regarding discovery in the Mason case. He advised that the discovery requests had been served and noted that responses had been received for the requests for admission, but that responses to interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He asked Deanna to advise when those remaining responses could be expected, and he concluded with his standard contact information and confidentiality notice, with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King cc’d on the email.\n\nFinally, on January 31, 2024, at 1:08 p.m., Koon sent another follow-up to Deanna Tucker regarding the outstanding discovery responses. He again requested guidance on when the responses may be expected and closed with his contact information and the confidentiality notice. The CC on this message included Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King, and the email carried the subject line RE: Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039).\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the emails repeatedly contained attorney-client privilege and confidentiality notices, and the sender’s firm information appeared in the signatures: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone numbers 502-365-5043 and fax numbers 502-364-9363 (and 502-237-3207 in earlier messages). The recipient list included Deanna M. Tucker of SBMK Law, with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King consistently copied. The subject lines in each message consistently referenced the case Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case 23-CI-006039, with the matter labeled as Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022 in the file. The client in this matter is Sariya Mason. The correspondence summarized below occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMK Law, involving counsel W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and Deanna M. Tucker (apparently a partner at SBMK).\n\nOn December 7, 2023, Bryce Koon sent an email to Deanna M. Tucker attaching Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed that day; a Word copy was included for convenience. He stated that if there were any questions, Deanna should let him know. The message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm’s phone number 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. The email carried the standard confidentiality notice applicable to electronic communications, and it identified the recipient as Deanna M. Tucker.\n\nIn a reply later the same day, December 7, 2023 at 3:13 PM, Deanna M. Tucker replied that Bryce should include her legal assistant, Kristy King, on emails and that she had copied Kristy on the email. She signed as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, with the SBMK address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. Her direct phone was 502-625-1671 and direct fax 502-779-9329. A confidentiality notice followed, reiterating privilege and the need to destroy or forward communications only to the intended recipient if there was an error in transmission.\n\nShortly after, at 3:15 PM on December 7, 2023, Bryce Koon replied, “Will do,” indicating he would include Kristy King on future emails. The communication again carried the Whaley Law Firm contact details and the same confidentiality notice.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Bryce Koon again wrote to Deanna M. Tucker. He noted that he was following up on the discovery requests served in this matter and observed that answers had been received for the requests for admission, but the responses to interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He requested that Deanna advise when the remaining responses could be expected. The message again included the Whaley Law Firm contact information and a confidentiality notice.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up email to Deanna M. Tucker, reiterating the outstanding discovery responses and asking Deanna to advise when they may be expected. The notice and contact details remained the same, with the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nFinally, on February 14, 2024, Bryce Koon sent a further forward-looking message to Deanna M. Tucker, copied to Sarena Tuttle of the Whaley Law Firm and Kristy M. King of SBMK. He stated that, as shown below, they had been attempting for some time to obtain responses to the interrogatories and requests for production of documents that had previously been served. He noted that he did not wish for extraneous litigation, but warned that if they did not receive a response by this time next week, they would be forced to file a motion to compel in this regard. The message, like the others, included the standard confidentiality notice and The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the involved offices were The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363) and SBMK Law (Deanna M. Tucker, Kristy M. King as requested), with Deanna’s affiliation and contact information provided in her reply of December 7, 2023. The emails repeatedly carry the confidentiality notices typical of attorney communications and reflect ongoing discovery practice in the Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022\nClient: Sariya Mason\n\nThis note summarizes a sequence of email communications in the matter of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case number 23-CI-006039. The communications involve counsel for the plaintiff, W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, and counsel for the defendants, Deanna M. Tucker. The note traces discovery-related correspondence beginning in December 2023 and continuing through February 2024, culminating in a filing that was attached to an email on February 21, 2024 and set for the following Monday’s motion hour.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, Bryce Koon sent an email to Deanna Tucker attaching Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed that day, and he noted that a Word copy was included for convenience. The message contains the standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of electronic correspondence from counsel, and the Whaley Law Firm’s contact details were included: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of 502-365-5043 and a fax number listed as 502-237-3207 in this instance. In the same thread, Deanna Tucker replied later that day (3:13 PM) requesting that her legal assistant, Kristy King, be included on emails, and she provided her own signature with the firm’s confidential notice. Bryce Koon responded shortly thereafter (3:15 PM) confirming that Kristy King would be included on future emails.\n\nEarlier, on January 18, 2024 (3:18 PM), Koon followed up on the discovery requests, noting that responses to the requests for admission had been received, but that the interrogatories and production of documents remained outstanding, and he asked when such responses could be expected. He included his standard firm signature and contact information, with the fax number listed as 502-364-9363 in this message. The confidentiality and privilege notices were again part of the email footer.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Koon again wrote Deanna Tucker to follow up on the outstanding discovery responses, requesting an update on when they may be expected. The message continued to bear the Whaley Law Firm’s identifying information and the customary confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Koon sent another reminder, noting that, “as you can see below,” the law firm had been attempting to obtain responses for some time. He stated that if they did not hear back by the following week, they would be forced to file a motion to compel regarding discovery responses. This message again carried his standard signature and the confidentiality notice.\n\nFinally, on February 21, 2024, Koon sent a good-afternoon counsel email informing Deanna Tucker that the attached filing had been filed that day and was set for the next Monday’s motion hour. The message indicates that the filing was associated with the Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo matter, and it reiterates the ongoing scheduling of a motion hour. The February 21 email also lists the same recipients as in prior messages, with Deanna Tucker as the primary recipient and Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King CC’d. The signature again identifies The Whaley Law Firm and provides the Louisville address, the phone line, and the fax line (this time listing the fax as 502-364-9363). As with the prior messages, the email includes the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nAcross the chain, the key facts include: the case caption and docket number of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, Jefferson Circuit, 23-CI-006039; the plaintiff’s first set of discovery and accompanying notice filed December 7, 2023; ongoing discovery responses (specifically, admitted responses obtained, but interrogatories and production of documents still outstanding); repeated follow-ups from counsel requesting prompt production of these documents and responses; and the intent to seek relief by way of a motion to compel if responses were not forthcoming by the stated deadlines. The communications also show a routine practice of including Kristy M. King, Deanna Tucker’s assistant, on correspondence and the use of standard client-attorney privilege and confidentiality notices in each email.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm’s contact details appear in the signature blocks across the messages, with the Louisville, Kentucky address of 712 Lyndon Lane, 40222, a landline of 502-365-5043, and the fax number varying between 502-237-3207 in December 2023 messages and 502-364-9363 in later messages (including the February 21, 2024 email). Deanna Tucker’s communications from this period also included a confidentiality notice and her role as a partner at the firm located at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, with direct phone 502-625-1671 and direct fax 502-779-9329.\n\nIn summary, this case has a documented history of discovery activity beginning with the December 2023 filing of the plaintiff’s first set of discovery, followed by a series of communications pressing for timely responses to interrogatories and production requests, and culminating in a February 21, 2024 email announcing a filed filing and a scheduled motion hour for the following Monday. The exchange reflects ongoing efforts to resolve discovery disputes with the potential for a motion to compel if timely responses were not provided.",

      "natural_language": "This case file, labeled Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022, concerns client Sariya Mason in the matter of Shrice Thomas (Saryia Mason) v. Castillo in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039. The Re line in the correspondence reflects the same case: Shrice Thomas (Saryia Mason) v. Castillo (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039).\n\nThe email communications involve Matthew Londergan of SBM-KY Law and W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with Sarena Tuttle CC’d on the thread. On February 23, 2024, Bryce Koon sent Matt Londergan an email with the subject Shrice Thomas (Saryia Mason) v. Castillo (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). He asked Matt to review the attached notice of remand and stated that he would follow up in a couple of weeks. Bryce provided his contact information and included a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer. There was an attachment indicated as a PNG file named 7B2639118C3B465BB62F885EB3C529AB[7722345].png. The message also carried a confidentiality notice: it was intended only for the named recipient, and if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, with no waiver of privilege, and should not forward the information to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, Bryce wrote again to Matt with the subject Shrice Thomas (Saryia Mason) v. Castillo (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). In that message, dated Friday, February 23, 2024 at 10:10 AM (the prior message’s date appears here, but it is part of the same thread), Bryce said: “Matt, Please see the attached notice of remand. I will follow back up with you in a couple of weeks. Thank you for your assistance in this regard.” This email, like the previous one, included Bryce’s firm contact information, a PNG attachment, and the confidentiality disclaimer. The recipient listed was mlondergan@sbmkylaw.com, with Sarena Tuttle CC’d, and the subject remained the same. The PNG attachment is again indicated as 7B2639118C3B465BB62F885EB3C529AB[7722345].png.\n\nFurther down the same March 18, 2024 thread, around 2:18 PM (the record notes a question mark next to the exact time), Bryce wrote: “Good afternoon Matt, Just wanted to follow up and see if you have gotten the discovery responses. Thanks.” The signature again included Bryce Koon’s credentials and contact information, along with the standard confidentiality language and the same PNG attachment placeholder.\n\nLater that day, at 22:13:53 +0000, Matthew Londergan replied to Bryce. In his message, he explained that he was out of the office on vacation until Wednesday and that they were working on finalizing the discovery responses, adding that he anticipated having them ready no later than the following week. This reply was sent to Bryce Koon, with Sarena Tuttle CC’d, and, like the earlier messages, contained the confidentiality disclaimer and the PNG attachment indicator.\n\nIn summary, the chain of correspondence in this case centers on the February 23, 2024 notice of remand, a March 18, 2024 follow-up from Bryce regarding discovery responses, and a March 18, 2024 response from Matt indicating a temporary absence and an expectation to complete the discovery responses by the following week, all within the context of attachments and standard privilege/confidentiality notices.",

A word copy is included for your convenience.\nIf you have any questions, please let me know.\n\nThttp:",
      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022\nClient: Sariya Mason\n\nCase context:\nIn the matter of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., filed in Jefferson Circuit Court (docket number 23-CI-006039), a sequence of discovery communications occurred between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and counsel at SBM Legal Group. The primary contacts were W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, representing the plaintiff, Sariya Mason, and Deanna M. Tucker, Esq., a partner at SBM, representing the defendant group. Kristy M. King, a legal assistant at SBM, and Sarena Tuttle, and others at the two firms were copied on various communications. The emails repeatedly noted that they contained attorney-client privileged material and were not to be disclosed if received in error.\n\nDecember 7, 2023 communications:\n- At 2:56 PM, Bryce Koon sent an email to Deanna M. Tucker with the subject Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039). He attached Plaintiff’s First Set of Discovery and the associated notice filed that day and stated that a Word copy was included for convenience. He asked Deanna to contact him with any questions.\n- At 3:13 PM, Deanna Tucker replied, noting that Bryce should include her legal assistant, Kristy King, on email communications and that she had copied Kristy on the present email.\n- At 3:15 PM, Bryce Koon responded confirming the same, and he continued the thread with the parties and copies as appropriate.\n\nJanuary 2024 follow-up communications:\n- January 18, 2024, at 3:18 PM, Bryce Koon sent a follow-up message to Deanna Tucker. He stated that discovery responses had been outstanding, including interrogatories and production of documents, and he requested that Deanna advise when they could be expected. He reiterated that there should be no waiver of privilege and that the messages were intended for the named recipient.\n- January 31, 2024, at 1:08 PM, Bryce Koon again followed up with Deanna Tucker, asking for an update on the outstanding discovery responses and when they might be expected.\n- January 18 and January 31 messages repeatedly referenced the parties’ ongoing efforts to obtain the plaintiff’s responses (interrogatories and production of documents) and warned that, absent timely responses, a motion to compel could be pursued.\n\nFebruary 2024 prior to the March 2024 disclosure:\n- February 7 or early February communications are noted in the record through February 14, 2024, at 4:09 PM. In this message, Bryce Koon stated that they had been attempting to obtain responses for some time and, while not seeking extraneous litigation, if no response was received by the following week, a motion to compel would be filed. He reiterated that the case involved interrogatories and requests for production of documents.\n- February 21, 2024, at 4:34 PM, Bryce Koon reported that “today” they had filed something related to the discovery and that the matter was set for next Monday’s motion hour. He signed as counsel for The Whaley Law Firm and included standard attorney-client disclaimers.\n\nMarch 25, 2024 communication:\n- On March 25, 2024, Kristy M. King, Legal Assistant for SBM, sent an email concerning the same case. In this message, she stated that attached were the Defendant’s discovery responses and document production. She noted that a hard copy would not follow by mail unless requested. The email included her contact information (address, direct phone, and direct fax) and bore SBM’s confidentiality notice. The communication was directed to counsel at The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon and Deanna M. Tucker) and copied Sarena Tuttle and Matthew Londergan.\n\nAdditional notes:\n- The chain repeatedly employed the standard confidentiality language typical of attorney communications, indicating that the messages and attachments were intended for the named recipients and may be privileged; if received in error, recipients were instructed to notify the sender and destroy the materials.\n- Throughout the timeline, the subject line for these communications consistently referenced Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039), and messages circulated among Bryce Koon, Deanna Tucker, Kristy King, Sarena Tuttle, and others at both law firms.\n- The March 25, 2024 message confirms the defendant’s discovery responses and document production had been assembled and sent electronically, with a note that a hard copy would not be mailed unless requested.\n\nIn summary, from December 2023 through March 2024, the parties engaged in a back-and-forth sequence regarding discovery responses and document production in the Jefferson Circuit case 23-CI-006039, with multiple follow-ups by The Whaley Law Firm indicating delays and potential motions to compel, culminating in a March 25, 2024 email transmitting the defendant’s discovery responses and production and noting no required hard-copy mailing unless requested.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The record documents a sequence of discovery-related communications in the case Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., filed in Jefferson Circuit Court (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039) and carried through spring 2024. The sender in most communications is W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363, though an earlier message shows a different fax number). The recipient list includes Deanna M. Tucker of SBMKY Law (dtucker@sbmkylaw.com) and her co-counsel, Deanna M. Tucker, along with other recipients such as Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King. The communications repeatedly reference the discovery responses and document productions associated with the defendant in this matter, as well as the scheduling of motions for their motion hour. Each email contains a confidentiality notice typical of attorney communications.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, Deanna M. Tucker replied to Bryce Koon, noting that Bryce should include her legal assistant, Kristy King, on future emails and indicating she had copied Kristy on the exchange. She signed as Deanna M. Tucker, a partner at her firm, with the email signature including her Louisville address and direct contact details. A confidentiality notice accompanied this and related messages.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Bryce followed up again, stating that, although answers to the requests for admission had been received, responses to the interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He indicated that, while he did not want extraneous litigation, a motion to compel would be pursued if no responses were forthcoming.\n\nThe next day, January 31, 2024, Bryce again reached out to Deanna Tucker, asking to be advised when the outstanding discovery responses could be expected. The correspondence continued the theme of pressing for complete discovery.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, Bryce sent another message to Deanna Tucker, reiterating that attempts had been ongoing for some time to obtain responses to the interrogatories and requests for production. He warned that if they did not hear back by the following week, they would be compelled to file a motion to compel. This message again carried the standard confidentiality boilerplate.\n\nA subsequent email on February 21, 2024, from Bryce Koon stated that the attached filing had been made that day and was set for the next Monday’s motion hour. The chain notes that this is in the Jefferson Circuit case identified as 23-CI-006039, and the message reiterates the motion-hour scheduling.\n\nOn March 25, 2024, Kristy M. King, serving as legal assistant, sent a message to Bryce Koon and Deanna Tucker (with Sarena Tuttle and Matthew Londergan CC’d) reporting that the defendant’s discovery responses and document production were attached. She indicated that a hard copy would not follow by mail unless requested and invited any questions. The message carries a confidentiality notice typical of such communications.\n\nFinally, on April 11, 2024, Bryce Koon sent Good morning emails to counsel stating that the attached motion had been filed that day and was set for Monday’s motion hour. He included a full signature block for The Whaley Law Firm, with the Louisville address and contact information. The record shows the ongoing coordination around the motion and the discovery matters in Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., in Jefferson Circuit Court (23-CI-006039). The April 11 message also includes the standard attorney-confidentiality notices typical of such communications.\n\nIn summary, over late 2023 and early to mid-2024, the parties repeatedly corresponded about outstanding discovery responses (interrogatories and document production), with admissions responses already provided, and ongoing efforts culminating in the filing of a motion (and scheduling for the motion hour) in the Jefferson Circuit case 23-CI-006039, all linked to the representation of Sariya Mason by The Whaley Law Firm and the opposing counsel, Deanna M. Tucker of SBMKY Law, along with several supporting staff.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes a series of communications in the case of Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case 23-CI-006039, involving the client Sariya Mason and the attorney team at The Whaley Law Firm (case file: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022). The messages center on discovery, production of documents, and motions, and they track the progression of discovery and related filings through early 2024.\n\nOn December 7, 2023, Deanna M. Tucker replied to a message from W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm regarding the Sariya Mason matter. Tucker indicated that she had received Bryce’s communications and requested that her legal assistant, Kristy M. King, be copied on emails. Tucker’s message also included a note that she had copies of the materials, and it was part of a thread that included contact with Sarena Tuttle and Kristy King, with all communications cc’d to them. Bryce’s signature on that message shows The Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville, Kentucky office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax of (502) 237-3207.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Bryce followed up regarding the discovery work in the case. He stated that, although they had received answers to the requests for admission, the responses to the interrogatories and the production of documents remained outstanding. He emphasized that, while he did not seek unnecessary litigation, if no responses were received by the following week, he would be forced to file a motion to compel the discovery responses.\n\n Bryce repeated the follow-up theme on January 31, 2024, writing that he was again seeking the outstanding discovery responses and asking for a timeline for their delivery.\n\nIn a February 14, 2024 message, Bryce again referenced the ongoing efforts to obtain responses to the interrogatories and production requests, reiterating that they had been attempting to obtain these for some time. He warned that, if they did not hear back within a week, they would be compelled to file a motion to compel. The message again reiterated the intention to move forward if there was no timely response.\n\nOn February 21, 2024, Bryce informed counsel that the attached document had been filed and that the matter was set for next Monday’s motion hour, signaling a scheduled hearing related to the discovery issues. His message reiterated the standard Whaley Law Firm closing and included the firm’s signature block with the same Louisville address and contact information.\n\nMeanwhile, on March 25, 2024, Kristy M. King, identified as a Legal Assistant for The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Bryce Koon and Deanna M. Tucker, with Sarena Tuttle and Matthew Londergan CC’d. King stated that the attached documents contained Defendant’s discovery responses and document production, and noted that a hard copy would not be mailed unless requested. King’s message also included her direct contact details: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502-625-1706; Direct Fax: 502-583-4780. The email also contained a confidentiality notice typical of attorney communications, underscoring that the content is for the named recipients and may be privileged.\n\nFinally, on April 11, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another communication to counsel, again noting that the attached motion had been filed that day and that it was set for Monday’s motion hour. This message continued the pattern of motion practice related to the discovery issues in the Mason case, with the same general recipients and cc’d parties. Bryce’s message was sent from The Whaley Law Firm at the same Louisville address and contact numbers.\n\nIn sum, between December 2023 and April 2024, counsel for Sariya Mason and the defense in Sariya Mason v. Surelis Castillo, et al. engaged in a back-and-forth regarding discovery responses, with multiple follow-ups from Bryce Koon, a March 2024 transmission of the defendant’s discovery responses and production, and two motions being set for hearing in connection with the discovery disputes (one set for the next Monday following February 21, 2024, and another set for the Monday following April 11, 2024).

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The matter is titled Castillo adv. Thomas and is being tracked under the Sariya-Mason-DB file for the client Sariya Mason.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, Deanna M. Tucker sent an email regarding the Castillo adv. Thomas matter. The message was from Deanna M. Tucker to Aaron Whaley, with copies sent to Bryce Koon, Sarena Tuttle, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan. The email is dated Monday, August 19, 2024 at 22:25:58 +0000. The body of the email includes Deanna’s standard confidentiality disclaimer, making clear that the communication and any attachments are confidential and subject to attorney‑client and/or work product privileges; if received in error, the recipient was instructed to notify the sender and destroy the communication. The signature block identifies Deanna as a partner at the firm, with contact details and a firm logo, followed by the confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on August 12, 2024, Deanna wrote to Aaron and Bryce asking for a one-week extension on the Responses to RFA, INT & RFP on behalf of Ms. Vilches. The message stated: “May we have a one-week extension on the Responses to RFA, INT & RFP on behalf of Ms. Vilches?” It was signed by Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, with the same Louisville address (401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202) and direct contact numbers (Direct Phone: 502.625.1671; Direct Fax: 502.779.9329), and it included the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAt 3:10 PM on August 12, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied to Deanna, replying to the extension request with a simple, affirmative: “Yes, that is fine.” This exchange took place in the same email thread that Deanna had initiated. The header lines show Aaron Whaley’s involvement and the continued distribution to the same CC list (Bryce Koon; Sarena Tuttle; Kristy M. King; Matthew Londergan).\n\nThe record also includes the signature blocks for the parties: Deanna’s signature lists her as a Partner at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, with Direct Phone: 502.625.1671 and Direct Fax: 502.779.9329, and contains the firm’s confidentiality notice. The trace also identifies Whaley Law Firm’s address as 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the contact phone 502-583-4022, corresponding to Aaron Whaley’s signature.",

King; to Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 – Filevine Project Email Address (SariyaMasonZ2040607@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com); and to Sarena Tuttle. The subject line was the ongoing matter in the case; the body stated: “Good afternoon counsel, Please see the attached motion to compel filed today and set for Monday's motion hour.” The message was signed by Mr. Koon and included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207). A standard electronic confidentiality/disclosure notice followed, instructing that the message is intended only for the named recipient and outlining privilege considerations, with instructions to contact the firm if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier correspondence in the same thread includes three prior messages by Bryce Koon. On September 12, 2024, at approximately 10:38 AM (text shows a question mark after AM), Koon wrote to counsel following up on the opposing party’s outstanding discovery responses, asking for an update on when those responses could be expected and warning that, if no prompt reply was received, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. The email again concluded with Koon’s signature and the firm’s contact information, along with the same confidentiality notice.\n\nPrior to that, on September 3, 2024, at approximately 3:45 PM (the timestamp includes a question mark after PM), Koon wrote to counsel to follow up on the outstanding discovery requests directed to Ms. Vilches, asking for any update on when those responses could be expected, and closing with his standard signature and confidentiality disclaimer.",

Wolford (paralegal at SBMKY Law) regarding the Thomas v. Castillo matter, with cc to Sarena at Whaley Law Firm and to the Sariya Mason Filevine project email address. The subject line read “Re: FW: Thomas v. Castillo.” In the body, Bryce stated that the video in question was presumably included in a link sent previously, but that, if not, the video should be accessible via the link provided: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sctz3bcvybirwnoa3dzee/Video-Footage-of-Attack.mp4?rlkey=8rlc4qwrszszm4bduq2jtk6bm&st=rk7uyx2n&dl=0.

The message ended with his signature, including his office address at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone number (502) 365-5043; and fax number (502) 237-3207. The email also contained The Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality notice, stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client or work product information; recipients who receive it in error should contact the firm and not disclose its contents.\n\nEarlier the same day, at 2:57 PM, Karen S. Wolford forwarded an email with the subject “Thomas v. Castillo” to AGWhaley@WhaleyLawFirm.com. In that message, Karen wrote: “Counsel – Good afternoon. Ms. Thomas advised the Louisville Metro Animal Control officer that she had a Ring video from her residence (in addition to the neighbor’s Ring camera footage). Can you please send me the video from Plaintiff’s Ring camera? Thank you.” Karen’s message included her professional title as Paralegal and her contact information: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1681; Direct Fax: 502.779.9339.

Wolford replied, noting, “I apologize, I meant to include you all on the below email. Thanks.” The reply appears to address the distribution of the prior message and to confirm additional recipients.

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The note documents a September 25, 2024 email exchange concerning the matter titled Thomas v. Castillo, within the Thomas v. Castillo file and related to the Sariya Mason client file (Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address).\n\nThe correspondence began with an email from Karen S. Wolford (kwolford@sbmkylaw.com) on September 25, 2024 at 19:24:32 UTC, addressed to Bryce Koon and copied to Sarena (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) and to the Filevine project email address for Sariya Mason. In that message, Wolford stated, “I believe that this is the neighbor’s video. I am looking for Plaintiff’s Ring camera video. Thanks!” The message was signed by Karen S. Wolford.\n\nIn Bryce Koon’s reply, sent later the same day at 3:15 PM, he wrote that he believes the requested video “was included with the link sent over previously, but if it was not, it should be available on the link below,” and he provided a Dropbox link to the video: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/sctz3bcvybirwnoa3dzee/Video-Footage-of-Attack.mp4?rlkey=8rlc4qwrszszm4bduq2jtk6bm&st=rk7uyx2n&dl=0. He added that if there were any trouble with the link or questions in this regard, Wolford should let him know. The signature identified him as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, with contact details including 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone 502-365-5043; Fax 502-237-3207. The message also included a standard electronic-sig block noting attorney-client privilege and instructions for reporting misdelivery.\n\nPreviously, at 2:57 PM on September 25, 2024, Karen S. Wolford had sent another email to AGWhaley@WhaleyLawFirm.com with the subject Thomas v. Castillo. In that message, she stated: “Counsel – Good afternoon. Ms. Thomas advised the Louisville Metro Animal Control officer that she had a Ring video from her residence (in addition to the neighbor’s Ring camera footage). Can you please send me the video from Plaintiff’s Ring camera? Thank you.” Wolford’s signature block followed, listing her role as Paralegal and providing the firm’s address (401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202) and direct contact numbers (Direct Phone: 502.625.1681; Direct Fax: 502.779.9339). The signature also contained the firm’s confidentiality notice and a note indicating that the communication is intended only for the named recipient and may be privileged.\n\nFollowing this, approximately one minute later, there is an entry indicating that Wolford sent a follow-up apology: “I apologize, I meant to include you all on the below email. Thanks.” This note was dated around 2:58 PM on the same day.\n\nThroughout the chain, the communications show the typical confidentiality notices associated with The Whaley Law Firm’s email signatures, warning that the message may contain attorney-client or work product privileges and instructing recipients who received the message in error to notify the sender and destroy the communication.\n\nIn summary, the records capture a sequence of requests and responses on September 25, 2024, regarding video evidence in Thomas v. Castillo, specifically seeking Plaintiff’s Ring camera footage from Ms. Thomas’s residence in addition to the neighbor’s Ring footage. Bryce Koon provided a Dropbox link for the Video-Footage-of-Attack.mp4, and Karen Wolford had earlier requested Plaintiff’s Ring camera video, clarifying the existence of multiple Ring camera sources. The note also contains the standard confidentiality disclosures and contact information for the involved parties.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note records a series of communications concerning the Thomas v. Castillo matter, with the Whaley Law Firm acting on behalf of the client in Kentucky.\n\nOn November 20, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note the new email address), sent an email to Kristy M. King regarding the Supplemental Discovery in the Thomas v. Castillo matter. She stated that the Supplemental Discovery had originally been served on October 18, 2024 and referenced attached email correspondence for further reference. She explained that while she understood Mrs. Tucker’s trial commitments, she could grant an extension only to November 29, 2024, and that any additional time would require approval from the attorneys. She noted that she had added the attorneys to the email chain for their review of the extension request and offered to discuss any further needs.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on November 19, 2024, Kristy M. King, Legal Assistant at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202 (direct phone 502-625-1706; direct fax 502-583-4780), wrote in reply (times noted in the thread as 3:46?PM): “Received, thank you.” She indicated that Ms. Tucker was not able to locate the email showing when the supplemental discovery had been sent to her and asked Sarena to confirm the date of service. Kristy also noted that Ms. Tucker was in trial that week and requested an extension for these responses, asking whether December 6 would be agreeable. The message included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThe thread also shows an earlier message from Kristy M. King titled “Thomas v. Castillo,” sent at 7:49?AM on November 19, 2024, to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com and bryce@whaleylawfirm.com. In that message, she requested a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that accompany the attached Notice of Service, stating that she had not received a copy. A forwarded message from Aaron Whaley then appears in the chain, followed by Kristy’s signature block.\n\nAdditionally, on November 19, 2024 at 3:35 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Kristy: “Good afternoon Kristy, Please find attached the Word & PDF versions of the requested documents. If you need anything else, please do not hesitate to contact us.” This message included Sarena’s signature with her title and contact information and again noted the new email address.\n\nAttached materials in the thread included Word and PDF versions of the requested documents, and the correspondence lists the parties in the chain as well as the CCs: Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon. The email chain also included confidentiality notices in the body of the messages.\n\nIn sum, the record shows that Supplemental Discovery was first served on October 18, 2024; an extension to November 29, 2024 was granted by Sarena Tuttle, with further extension beyond that requiring attorney approval. Kristy King sought confirmation of the service date and proposed December 6, 2024 as an additional extension due to Ms. Tucker’s trial schedule, while also requesting a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that accompany the Notice of Service, which had not been received. The thread includes multiple copies of attachments (Word and PDF) and standard confidentiality notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. Re: Thomas v. Castillo. This sequence documents the email communications among the Whaley Law Firm and SBMKYLaw regarding supplemental discovery in the Thomas v. Castillo matter, within the Sariya Mason file, including dates, extensions, and the exchange of documents.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, at 7:49 a.m., Kristy M. King, a Legal Assistant at SBMKY Law, sent an email to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com and bryce@whaleylawfirm.com with the subject Thomas v. Castillo. She requested a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that accompany the attached Notice of Service, noting that she had not received a copy herself. Her message began with a cordial “Good Morning” and included her contact details: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone: 502.625.1706; Direct Fax: 502.583.4780.\n\nThat same day, a forwarded copy of Kristy King’s request was sent in an email from Aaron Whaley within the Whaley Law Firm to his colleagues, reflecting the ongoing exchange about the Thomas v. Castillo matter and confirming that Kristy had not received the supplemental discovery requests.\n\nLater that day, at 3:35 p.m., Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Kristy. She stated, “Please find attached the Word & PDF versions of the requested documents. If you need anything else, please do not hesitate to contact us.” Her message confirmed that the Word and PDF versions of the requested documents had been attached. The signature block identified her at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address and contact information, and reminded recipients to note her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, at 3:46 p.m., Kristy M. King responded: “Received, thank you. Ms. Tucker was not able to locate the email for when these were sent to her, can you confirm the date of service for me? Ms. Tucker is in trial this week and we will need to request an extension on these responses, would December 6th be agreeable?” Kristy’s message reiterated the need to confirm the service date and proposed a December 6 extension deadline, given her client’s trial schedule. Her message included her standard SBMKY Law contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nThe email chain shows that Sarena’s earlier note from November 20, 2024, at approximately 10:02 a.m., referenced the supplemental discovery originally served on October 18, 2024. In that communication, Sarena attached the relevant email correspondence for reference. She explained that while they understood Mrs. Tucker’s trial commitments, she could grant an extension to November 29, 2024, with any additional extension requiring approval by the attorneys involved. She stated she had added the attorneys to the chain to review the extension request and invited further discussion if needed.\n\nFinally, on December 2, 2024, Sarena wrote to Kristy again: “Good afternoon Kristy, We just wanted to touch base with you on these Responses, any update would be greatly appreciated.” She signed as the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm and provided her contact information, reiterating the note about her new email address.\n\nAcross the thread, the participants included Kristy M. King of SBMKYLaw, Deanna Tucker (also at SBMKYLaw), and senior firm members Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, all copied on various messages. The communications center on obtaining and confirming the date of service for the supplemental discovery requests related to Thomas v. Castillo, the need for extensions due to trial schedules, and the provision of Word and PDF versions of the requested documents. The case note remains within the Sariya Mason file (Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022) and pertains to the Thomas v. Castillo matter, with new contact details noted for Sarena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. Re: Thomas v. Castillo.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, Deanna M. Tucker, a partner at SBMKY Law, sent an email to Sarena Tuttle and Kristy M. King with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon CC’ed. In her message, she said she hoped Sarena was well and noted that Friday had apparently been a court holiday, adding that they would serve “these” that day. She signed as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker, Partner, and provided her office address—401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202—as well as her direct phone number (502.625.1671) and direct fax (502.779.9329). The email footer also included a confidentiality notice stating the communication is intended only for the named recipients and may be subject to attorney-client and/or work product privileges; if received in error, the recipient should notify the sender and destroy the email. The signature line identified her as Deanna M. Marzian Tucker.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:17 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Kristy King and Deanna Tucker, with Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon CC’ed, asking for an update on “these Responses.” Her message also included her contact information, noting a new email address for herself: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct and office numbers and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe thread contains a longer history of communications preceding that December 2 exchange. On November 20, 2024 (time indicated as 10:02 AM, though the exact minutes are unclear in the record), Sarena wrote that the Supplemental Discovery had originally been served on October 18, 2024. She referenced attached email correspondence for further reference, acknowledged Mrs. Tucker’s trial-related situation, and stated that she could grant an extension to November 29, 2024; any additional extension would require approval by the attorneys. She noted that she had added the attorneys to the chain for review of the extension request and invited further discussion if needed.\n\nEarlier, on November 19, 2024, at 3:46 PM, Kristy M. King replied: She had received the prior message and confirmed that Ms. Tucker was not able to locate the email showing when the supplemental discovery had been sent. She asked Kristy to confirm the date of service and indicated that Ms. Tucker would be in trial that week and that they would need to request an extension on the responses, proposing December 6 as an agreeable date.\n\nKristy’s message was followed by a November 19, 2024, 3:35 PM response from Sarena: “Please find attached the Word & PDF versions of the requested documents. If you need anything else, please do not hesitate to contact us.” This message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle with the same Whaley Law Firm contact details and again noted the new email address.\n\nEarlier still, at 10:38 AM on November 19, 2024, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message from Kristy M. King. In Kristy’s earlier note, dated November 19, 2024 at 7:49 AM, she addressed the matter to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com and bryce@whaleylawfirm.com and asked: “Good Morning, would you please send me a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that go with the attached Notice of Service? I never received a copy.” Kristy included her own contact information and a confidentiality notice in her signature.\n\nThe chain concludes with Aaron Whaley’s signature block after Kristy’s initial request.\n\nIn summary, this case involves the Thomas v. Castillo matter in which supplemental discovery was served October 18, 2024, with ongoing discussions in November 2024 about extensions due to trial schedules. On December 2, 2024, Deanna Tucker indicated they would serve the documents that day, and Sarena Tuttle sought updates regarding the responses. The communications reveal multiple parties coordinating service, requesting and granting extensions (noting a tentative extension to November 29, 2024, and the possibility of additional extensions subject to attorney approval), and sharing attachments of the Word and PDF versions of the requested documents. The thread also establishes new contact details for Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) and reiterates confidentiality provisions present in each email.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Thomas v. Castillo, within the Sariya-Mason file (Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022) for client Sariya Mason, an email chain in late November and early December 2024 covered discovery responses and extension requests. The primary participants were Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm; Deanna M. Tucker, Partner at SBM Kentucky Law; Kristy M. King, Legal Assistant at SBM Kentucky Law; and colleagues Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nOn December 2, 2024, at 3:12 PM, Sarena sent a note to Deanna Tucker with copies to Kristy King and others, acknowledging an extension request that had been noted for December 6. Sarena stated she could grant only a two-week extension, which would fall on a holiday Friday, and she expressed understanding that papers would not be received on that day. She closed by noting her new contact information.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:57 PM, Deanna Tucker replied, acknowledging that Friday had been a court holiday and indicating that they would serve the documents that day. The message included Deanna’s standard contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nAlso on December 2, at 2:17 PM, Sarena followed up with Kristy King (and Deanna Tucker), asking for an update on the responses and inviting further discussion if needed.\n\nLooking back, on November 20, 2024, Sarena had written that the Supplemental Discovery was originally served on October 18, 2024. She referenced attached email correspondence for context and explained that, while she understood Deanna Tucker’s trial commitments, she could grant an extension to November 29, 2024, with any additional time requiring approval from the attorneys. She added the attorneys to the email chain for review of the extension request.\n\nEarlier, on November 19, 2024, Kristy King replied that she had received the prior message and noted that Deanna Tucker had been unable to locate the email showing when the materials were sent; Kristy asked for confirmation of the date of service and suggested that, given Tucker’s trial schedule, they would need to request an extension and asked whether December 6 would be agreeable.\n\nThat same day, November 19, at 3:35 PM, Sarena responded to Kristy, attaching Word and PDF versions of the requested documents and inviting any further needs.\n\nAt 10:38 AM on November 19, 2024, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message from Kristy King requesting a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that accompany the attached Notice of Service, noting that she had not received a copy. Kristy’s message included her contact details and a confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nKristy King’s earlier message, sent at 7:49 AM on November 19, 2024, had asked for a copy of the supplemental discovery requests that go with the attached Notice of Service, stating that she never received them. Aaron Whaley then forwarded Kristy’s request into the chain, with contact information for himself and Bryce Koon.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the parties discussed service dates, potential extensions (including a proposed December 6 extension), the need for attorney approval for extensions beyond November 29, 2024, and the provision of Word and PDF copies of the requested discovery documents. The chain also included confidentiality notices typical of communications among the firms.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The note concerns the matter titled Thomas v. Castillo.\n\nOn Friday, January 3, 2025, at 20:14:10 UTC, Matthew Londergan of SBMKY Law sent an email to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding the Thomas v. Castillo matter. In the message, Londergan apologized for an oversight and stated that an attached .amr file contained a recorded statement from the witness Leandry Badia. He noted that the file should be playable in Windows Media Player or VLC Media Player and offered to re-send the recording as a .zip file if there were any issues opening it. He closed by providing his direct contact information and attaching a confidentiality notice.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied on the same day at 2:57 PM, acknowledging receipt and indicating that, upon initial review, there was reference to a recording from Leandry Badia, but she had not actually received any recording. She pointed out that the Response to the Request for Production indicated the recording had been previously provided, yet it did not appear to be attached to the initial production file, and she asked that a copy of the alleged recording be forwarded for review. Her signature also notes that she is a Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm and includes her new email address.\n\nEarlier that same day, at around 2:47 PM, Matthew Londergan sent another email to counsel stating, “Counsel: Please find attached to the below email from Benji Smith, Supplemental Responses to the Interrogatories and Requests for Production of Documents propounded upon Surelis Castillo. A hard copy will not follow unless requested.” This message was followed by Londergan’s standard confidentiality notice.\n\nBenji Smith of Barnes Maloney PLLC sent a separate email at 2:21 PM to Sarena Tuttle (with copies to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, bryce@whaleylawfirm.com, Matthew Londergan, Kristy M. King, and Deanna M. Tucker) concerning Thomas v. Castillo. Smith’s message header identifies his firm’s contact details: Barnes Maloney PLLC, 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; email bsmith@sbmkylaw.com; direct phone 502.625.1674; direct fax 502.779.9326; mobile 502.553.5258; website www.sbmkylaw.com. The email includes a confidentiality notice and indicates it was sent to the Whaley Law Firm, with the subject line Thomas v. Castillo. The signature block also includes an image placeholder reference and the standard confidentiality language.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the chain demonstrates efforts to provide a witness recording (Leandry Badia) and to address the parties’ requests for production, while also noting gaps in the initial production and confirming availability of supplemental materials.",

      "natural_language": "In the Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022 file for client Sariya Mason, the matter titled Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, in the Jefferson Circuit Court (case number 23-CI-006039), multiple deposition-coordination emails were exchanged. On Friday, January 24, 2025, at 12:24:57 PM Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Deanna Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sarena Tuttle copied and the Sariya Mason Filevine project email address included in the CC. The subject of the message was “Re: Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al - Jeff Cir Crt - 23-CI-006039.” In the body, Koon stated that they were “again attempting to obtain dates for your client's depositions” and requested that dates be provided for February or March. He signed with his name, title, and The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207). The message also contained the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer indicating the message is intended only for the named recipient and that any inadvertent receipt should be reported to the firm, with no waiver of privilege and instructions not to use or forward the information.\n\nEarlier that month, on Friday, January 17, 2025, at 2:22 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied to counsel with the subject of advancing deposition scheduling for Mrs. Vilches. In her message, she noted the need to obtain deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and requested confirmation of her native language, which she described as a derivative of Spanish. She emphasized the urgency of providing this information to avoid further delays, pointing out that the claim is over 2.5 years old and that there is video footage of the incident showing an unprovoked attack. She also observed that your clients tend to leave the United States to visit family and suggested that a Zoom deposition might be the best option, though not ideal. Tuttle invited the recipients to contact her to discuss the matter in further detail. Her signature block listed her direct line (D: 502-357-9971) and office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), her email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), and the note that it was a new email address, along with the standard firm contact details.\n\nAlso on January 9, 2025, at 2:03 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote another message to counsel. She stated that, after reviewing the file, all written discovery appeared to be completed or near completion and that the firm would like to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Vilches as soon as possible. She requested dates on which both sides’ counsel and their clients would be available. Given that Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, she noted the need to schedule a translator and asked that the recipients confirm Mrs. Vilches' native dialogue to ensure the best translator could be engaged. Tuttle’s signature reiterated her role as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the same contact details as above (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; and a notice of the new email address).\n\nAcross these communications, the core issue remained the scheduling of depositions for Mrs. Vilches in the Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al matter, with the parties discussing language translation needs, the possibility of a Zoom deposition, urgency due to the case’s lengthy duration, and the coordination of dates in February or March (as requested by Koon) following the prior discovery developments. The emails reflect ongoing coordination between The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel, the involvement of Sarena M. Tuttle in pretrial logistics, and the multilingual considerations necessary for the deposition of Mrs. Vilches.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The note concerns the matter captioned Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al in the Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, at 12:24:57 PM (Eastern Time), Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an electronic message regarding deposition dates. The email was addressed to Deanna Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sarena Tuttle and a Sariya Mason Filevine project email address copied on the message. The subject line reiterates the underlying case caption and docket: Re: Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al - Jeff Cir Crt - 23-CI-006039. In the body of the message, Koon wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, We are again attempting to obtain dates for your client's depositions. Please provide dates in February or March for when these can be conducted.” He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and listed the phone number as (502) 365-5043 and the fax number as (502) 237-3207. The email also included a standard confidentiality notice stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient, may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information, and that if received in error the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not use or forward the information to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nEarlier correspondence in the thread shows two prior messages from Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. On January 17, 2025, at approximately 2:22 PM (the record shows a question mark after 2:22 PM), Tuttle wrote to counsel asking for deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and requesting confirmation of her native language. Tuttle noted the need for this information to avoid further delays, emphasizing that the claim was over 2.5 years old and that there is video footage of the incident showing an unprovoked attack. She mentioned that counsel’s clients tend to travel out of the United States to visit family and suggested that a Zoom deposition might be the best option, though not ideal, and invited any questions to discuss the matter further. Tuttle’s signature block listed her titles as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, the firm’s name and address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), phone number (D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104), and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating the address as the new email address.\n\nOn January 9, 2025, at about 2:03 PM, Tuttle again wrote to counsel. She stated that, upon review of the file, it appeared that all written discovery had been completed and/or was near completion. She expressed a desire to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Vilches as soon as possible and asked that counsel provide dates when both sides would be available. She added that because Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, they would need to schedule a translator and requested that counsel confirm Mrs. Vilches’ native dialogue to ensure the scheduling of the best translator. The January 9 message carried the same signature block as the January 17 message, including the note about the new email address.\n\nAcross these communications, the parties repeatedly reference scheduling depositions for Mrs. Vilches in connection with the same underlying matter, with ongoing consideration of language needs (translation), potential use of virtual deposition via Zoom due to travel considerations, and the age of the claim alongside existing video footage of the incident.",

Yanelys Castillo et al., case number 23-CI-006039. The record also lists a Filevine project email for Sariya Mason: SariyaMasonZ2040607@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nOn February 4, 2025 at 10:01:04 AM (GMT-05:00), W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email from bryce@whaleylawfirm.com to opposing counsel Deanna Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sarena Tuttle and the Sariya Mason Filevine contact CC’d. The message stated that the attached filing had been filed that day and was set for next Monday’s motion hour. It included Bryce Koon’s signature and the firm’s contact information, along with the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and instructing recipients who received it in error to contact the sender and not to forward the information.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on January 9, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote that, after reviewing the file, all written discovery appeared completed and/or near completion. She stated the intention to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Vilches as soon as possible and asked for dates in which both counsel and their client would be available. Because Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, she requested that a translator be scheduled and asked that the recipient confirm Mrs. Vilches’ native dialect to ensure the best translator could be arranged. This message carried the Whaley Law Firm signature block and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle sent another message to counsel requesting deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and noting that Mrs. Vilches speaks some derivative of Spanish. She requested confirmation of her native language to avoid further delays, emphasized that the claim is over 2.5 years old and includes video footage of the incident showing an unprovoked attack, and suggested that a Zoom deposition may be the best option given that defense clients reportedly leave the United States to visit family, though Zoom is not ideal. She invited direct contact to discuss the matter further and again provided her Whaley Law Firm contact information and new email address.\n\nOn January 24, 2025 at approximately 12:24 PM, Bryce Koon replied that they were again seeking deposition dates for the client’s deposition and requested dates in February or March for when such depositions could be conducted. The message included the standard confidentiality disclaimer typical of the firm’s communications.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the messages included the Whaley Law Firm’s standard attorney-client privilege notices and instructions regarding misdelivery. The chronology reflects ongoing efforts to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Vilches, address language translation needs, and coordinate dates for depositions in the Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al. matter, all while managing the related Sariya Mason case file.",

Because Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, they would need to schedule a translator and requested that opposing counsel confirm Mrs. Vilches’ native dialogue to ensure the best translator could be arranged. The email included Tuttle’s contact details and noted her new email address.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, at 2:22 p.m. (time shown as 2:22?PM), Sarena Tuttle wrote again. She stated they were trying to obtain deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and noted that Mrs. Vilches speaks some derivative of Spanish; they requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’ native language as well. Tuttle urged providing this information as soon as possible to avoid further delays, emphasizing that the claim is over 2.5 years old and includes video footage of the incident showing an unprovoked attack. She added that counsel’s clients tend to leave the United States to visit family and suggested that a Zoom deposition might be best, though not ideal, and invited direct contact to discuss further.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, at approximately 12:24 p.m. (time shown as 12:24?PM), Bryce Koon again wrote to counsel. He stated that they were “again attempting to obtain dates for your client’s depositions” and requested dates in February or March when those depositions could be conducted. This message also carried The Whaley Law Firm’s standard privilege disclaimer, indicating the message was for the named recipient, may contain privileged information, and advising that if received in error, the recipient should contact the firm and not disclose or forward the contents.\n\nThroughout these emails, the standard electronic-communications disclaimers were included in each message, noting privilege and the intended recipient, with instructions for recipients who may have received the message in error to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not use or forward the information.\n\nAdditional details in the January thread show that Sarena M. Tuttle’s messages carried her role and contact information, including her extension (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104) and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with an explicit note that the address is their new email. The messages repeatedly reference the same case and the scheduling of depositions for Mrs. Vilches, along with concerns about language barriers, the need for translators, and potential Zoom deposition arrangements given travel considerations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note concerns the matter Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., in Jeff Cir Crt, 23-CI-006039.\n\nIn correspondence regarding the deposition scheduling for the case, on January 9, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to counsel. She stated that, upon reviewing the file, all written discovery had been completed or was near completion, and she requested that dates be provided for when both counsel and their client would be available to participate in the deposition of Mrs. Vilches as soon as possible. She noted that Mrs. Vilches’ native language is a language other than English, so they would need to schedule a translator and asked that counsel confirm Mrs. Vilches’ native dialogue to ensure the best translator could be arranged.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, at approximately 2:22 PM (the time is rendered as “2:22?PM” in the record), Sarena Tuttle followed up with counsel. She reiterated the request to obtain deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and highlighted the need to confirm her native language, given that she speaks some derivative of Spanish. She emphasized the urgency, stating that the claim is over 2.5 years old and includes video footage of an unprovoked attack. She also noted that counsel’s clients tend to travel outside the United States to visit family and suggested that a Zoom deposition could be the best option, though it was not ideal. She offered to discuss any questions directly.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, at 12:25 PM, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Deanna M. Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sarena Tuttle cc’d and Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 – Filevine Project Email Address included. The message stated: “Good afternoon counsel, We are again attempting to obtain dates for your client's depositions. Please provide dates in February or March for when these can be conducted.” The message appears with a standard disclaimer about attorney-client privileged or protected information and notes that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not use or forward the information, with no waiver of privilege implied.\n\nFinally, on February 7, 2025, at 20:38:29 UTC, an email from Matthew Londergan to Bryce Koon was sent. Londergan apologized for the delay in responding and stated that both of their clients were available on the following dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11:00 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 at any time; Thursday, March 13 at any time; and Thursday, March 27 at any time. He confirmed that a Spanish interpreter would be needed for these depositions. He asked to be advised if these dates did not work and indicated that they would obtain additional dates. He noted that Thursdays generally work best for their clients. The email included his direct phone and fax numbers, along with the firm’s address. It also contained a confidentiality notice indicating that the communication, including any attachments, is intended only for the named recipient and may be subject to attorney-client and/or work product privileges; if received in error, the recipient should notify the sender and destroy the communication, with no waiver of privilege.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The matter at issue is Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039. The notes reflect a series of emails between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKylaw.com regarding depositions for Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo in this case, with Sariya Mason listed in the file as of 08/19/2022 (Filevine project email address: SariyaMasonZ2040607@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com).\n\nStarting January 9, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to counsel recommending that the deposition of Mrs. Vilches be scheduled as soon as possible. She noted that Mrs. Vilches’s native language is something other than English and requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’s native dialogue to ensure the scheduling of an appropriate translator. She also highlighted that the claim is over 2.5 years old and that video footage exists showing an unprovoked attack, and she suggested that a Zoom deposition might be best if travel proves difficult. The message was signed with Sarena M. Tuttle’s contact information, including the note “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nOn January 17, 2025, Sarena followed up again with counsel, indicating the need to obtain deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches and reiterating that Mrs. Vilches speaks some derivative of Spanish and that confirmation of her native language was required to arrange an appropriate translator. She urged providing information promptly to avoid further delays in a case where the parties may be traveling since they tend to leave the United States to visit family, and she again suggested a Zoom deposition as a possible, though less ideal, option.\n\nA January 24, 2025 email from Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (sent to Deanna M. Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sarena Tuttle and Sariya Mason DB cc’d) reiterated the ongoing effort to obtain deposition dates for the clients. Bryce requested dates in February or March for the depositions. The message included the standard confidentiality language common to these communications and provided Bryce Koon’s firm contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207. An image was attached, and the email contained the firm’s confidentiality notice, stating that the communication is intended only for the named recipient and that privilege may apply.\n\nOn February 7, 2025, Matthew R. Londergan, Attorney at SBMKylaw, replied to Bryce and others. He listed available deposition dates for February and March: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 at any time; Thursday, March 13 at any time; and Thursday, March 27 at any time. He confirmed that a Spanish interpreter would be needed for these depositions. He invited the other side to indicate if any dates did not work so that additional dates could be provided, noting that Thursdays generally work best for their clients.\n\nBy February 10, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle responded with a proposed timing for the depositions. She proposed that on March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., the deposition with Mrs. Vilches would occur first, followed by the deposition with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon, or vice versa. She asked whether their office could be used for the convenience of the parties. The message was signed by Sarena with the same contact details and again included the notice to use the new email address. The note also lists The Whaley Law Firm’s address and contact lines, and reiterates the ongoing coordination among the counsel and the clients in the Jeff Cir Crt case 23-CI-006039.\n\nIn summary, the communications between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKylaw between January and February 2025 centered on scheduling the depositions of Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo in the Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al matter, with emphasis on obtaining Spanish-language interpretation, the possibility of Zoom participation, and leveraging counsel’s offices for convenience on March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m.",

      "natural_language": "In the Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al. case (Jeff Cir Crt - 23-CI-006039), the structured correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKY Law concerns scheduling depositions for the clients Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo. The client listed in the file is Sariya Mason, with the case reference Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 in Filevine.\n\nThe first relevant note begins with an email chain from January 9, 2025, when Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, advised counsel that all written discovery had been completed or was near completion. She requested that the deposition of Mrs. Vilches be scheduled as soon as possible and asked that both sides provide dates when they and their clients would be available. Because Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, Sarena also asked that a translator be arranged and that the native language of Mrs. Vilches be confirmed to ensure proper scheduling.\n\nA follow-up from January 17, 2025 reiterates the scheduling request for Mrs. Vilches’s deposition and adds that Mrs. Vilches speaks some derivative of Spanish. Sarena requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’s native language to determine the best translator. She also noted that the claim is more than 2.5 years old and emphasizes the existence of video footage showing an unprovoked attack, suggesting that a Zoom deposition might be preferable though not ideal. She urged prompt scheduling and invited any questions to be discussed directly.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Bryce Koon, counsel for The Whaley Law Firm, responded to the scheduling requests. He stated that they were again attempting to obtain dates for the client depositions and asked for dates in February or March when the depositions could be conducted. The message was addressed to Deanna M. Tucker and Kristy M. King and copied to Sarena Tuttle and the Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 Filevine project email address. The correspondence included standard confidentiality language indicating it was intended only for the named recipients and warning against disclosure if received in error.\n\nFollowing that, on February 7, 2025, Matthew Londergan of SBMKY Law replied to Bryce and others. He apologized for the delay and stated that both of their clients were available on several dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 any time; Thursday, March 13 any time; and Thursday, March 27 any time. He also confirmed that a Spanish interpreter would be required for the depositions. He invited colleagues to flag any conflicts with those dates and offered to obtain additional options if needed. His message also included his standard attorney contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied with a proposed deposition plan. She wrote that March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., with Mrs. Vilches, and continuing with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon (or vice versa) would work for The Whaley Law Firm. She asked Matthew Londergan whether they could use his office for the convenience of the parties.\n\nThat same day, February 10, 2025, at 3:24 p.m., Matthew Londergan confirmed that the conference room at their office would be available on the requested day, and he noted that the depositions could proceed in either order depending on what the parties preferred. He provided his direct phone and fax numbers and included his firm’s confidentiality notice. He also shared the firm’s address: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202.\n\nIn summary, the depositions for Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo were being coordinated with a plan to hold them on March 6, 2025, starting at 10:00 a.m., in the conference room at SBMKY Law’s Louisville office, with flexibility regarding the order of the two depositions and the use of a Spanish interpreter to accommodate language needs. The parties also considered the possibility of conducting a Zoom deposition if necessary, given the age of the case and the existence of video footage of the incident.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The matter at hand is Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, in Jeff Cir Court, case number 23-CI-006039. The file concerns deposition planning for Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo, in support of the underlying claim involving Sariya Mason.\n\nOn January 9, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote that, after reviewing the file, all written discovery had been completed and/or was near completion. She stated a deposition of Mrs. Vilches should be scheduled as soon as possible and asked for dates on which both counsel and their clients would be available. Because Mrs. Vilches’ native language is not English, she requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’ native dialogue to ensure the scheduling of an appropriate translator.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, Sarena followed up, noting that deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches were still needed and requesting confirmation of the language details. She emphasized that the claim was over 2.5 years old and included video footage of the incident showing an unprovoked attack. She also indicated that a Zoom deposition might be best, though not ideal, and asked to discuss any questions directly to avoid further delays.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., with The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Deanna Tucker, Kristy King, Matthew Londergan, and others, stating that counsel was again attempting to obtain deposition dates for the clients and requesting dates in February or March for when the depositions could be conducted. The message included Bryce’s contact information and a note referencing the Sariya Mason file: “Sariya Mason DB 08/19/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address <SariyaMasonZ2040607@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com>.”\n\nOn February 7, 2025, Matthew R. Londergan, Attorney, responded with available dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6, any time; Thursday, March 13, any time; and Thursday, March 27, any time. He confirmed that both clients are available on those dates and noted that a Spanish interpreter would be required for the depositions. He asked to be notified if any of these dates did not work to obtain additional options, and he observed that Thursdays generally work best for their clients.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Sarena replied that March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., with Mrs. Vilches, and continuing with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon or vice versa, would work for their office. She asked whether they could use Matthew’s office for the depositions to facilitate the proceedings. In a prior related exchange, Sarena had requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’ language to arrange translation accordingly.\n\nThat same day, February 10, 2025, at 10:24 a.m. (the exact time is shown as 10:24?AM in the record), Matthew responded that the conference room at their office would be available on that day and that the depositions could proceed in whichever order the parties preferred. Later that day, at 11:04 a.m., Sarena replied, “Awesome, sounds great. We will get a notice over to you & the court reporter today.”\n\nThroughout the correspondence, standard confidentiality notices accompany the messages, reiterating privileges and instructing recipients to notify the sender if a message was received in error. The records also show various contact details for the participants, including Sarena Tuttle’s address at The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, KY, with direct lines and her new email address, and Matthew Londergan’s office address and direct lines. The exchange also references the ongoing need for a Spanish interpreter and the logistics of arranging depositions for Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo, with a preference for using the office of Matthew Londergan for convenience.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jefferson Circuit Court Case 23-CI-006039, the depositions of the witnesses were coordinated across a long email thread in early 2025. The client listed in the structured file is Sariya Mason (case file: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022). The thread shows ongoing discussions between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKY Law about scheduling depositions for Ms. Thomas and Ms. Mason, with a particular focus on the witnesses Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo, and with a Spanish interpreter required.\n\nThe exchange began with an email from January 9, 2025. Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, asked Matthew Londergan, an attorney at SBMKY Law, to schedule the deposition of Mrs. Vilches as soon as possible. She requested confirmation of Mrs. Vilches’s native language to ensure an appropriate translator could be arranged, noting that the language was not English and that scheduling would hinge on identifying the best translator for Mrs. Vilches.\n\nOn January 17, 2025, Sarena followed up, indicating that March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., would work for her office for the deposition of Mrs. Vilches, with the deposition of Mrs. Castillo to follow in the afternoon or vice versa. She also suggested using SBMKY’s office for the convenience of the parties and asked for confirmation of the native language to ensure proper translation arrangements. Her message also referenced that the claim in question is more than two and a half years old and included video footage of the incident, described as an unprovoked attack, underscoring the time sensitivity of scheduling and translation needs.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm emailed counsel, reiterating the need to obtain deposition dates and requesting dates in February or March for both sides’ clients. He CC’d Sarena Tuttle and included Sariya Mason’s filehouse contact as part of the Filevine project.\n\nOn February 7, 2025, Matthew Londergan replied to Bryce, listing several potential dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 (any time); Thursday, March 13 (any time); and Thursday, March 27 (any time). He noted that both clients would require a Spanish interpreter and welcomed additional date suggestions if these did not work, adding that Thursdays generally work best for their clients.\n\nThe thread continued on February 9 and February 10, 2025, with further scheduling details. On February 10 at 9:46 a.m., Sarena Tuttle responded that March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., would work for her office for the deposition of Mrs. Vilches, with Mrs. Castillo to be scheduled for the afternoon or vice versa. She asked whether SBMKY would allow the deposition to be held at The Whaley Law Firm’s office for the convenience of the parties and reiterated the need to confirm Mrs. Vilches’s native language to arrange a translator.\n\nShortly after, at 10:24 a.m. on February 10, Matthew Londergan confirmed that the conference room at SBMKY’s office would be available on that day and that the deposition order could be arranged to suit the parties’ preferences. He indicated that the depositions could be conducted in SBMKY’s conference room and that the order of the two depositions could be arranged to accommodate the witnesses.\n\nLater on February 10, 2025, at 11:04 a.m., Sarena wrote that she would send a notice to both the opposing counsel and the court reporter that day. She reaffirmed the confidentiality of the communication, as did the standard notices that accompanied the email chain.\n\nFinally, at 4:16 p.m. (UTC) on February 10, 2025, Matthew Londergan sent a concluding note reiterating the request to schedule the depositions within the same timeframe and asking Sarena to provide dates in March or April when Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason could be available. He closed with his standard attorney signature block, including his office address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, direct phone number 502.625.1678, and direct fax 502.779.9336.\n\nThroughout these correspondences, confidentiality notices were included in each message, reminding recipients that the communications and any attachments are intended for the named parties and may be privileged. The exchanges show a collaborative effort to coordinate two depositions (Ms. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo) in the JeffCir Crt case, with a strong emphasis on securing a Spanish interpreter and choosing a scheduling window that aligns with both sides’ availability in March and April, ideally within SBMKY’s conference room for convenience. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details were consistently provided, including Sarena Tuttle’s role as a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, and her new email address.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter titled Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, Jeff Cir Court, case number 23-CI-006039, the Whaley Law Firm's file for Sariya Mason (case noted as Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022) documents communications between The Whaley Law Firm and SBM KY Law regarding scheduling depositions. The client listed is Sariya Mason.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, at 11:23:12 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Matthew Londergan of SBM KY Law. In that message, she wrote: “Absolutely, Mr. Londergan, Please find attached the NTTD for the Defendant's Depositions. We have requested a Spanish Translator for that day as well. I have sent a request to Mrs. Thomas & Sariya to check when they can be available. I will update you as soon as I hear back.” Her signature noted her contact details, including her new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address and telephone numbers.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 11:16 a.m., Matthew R. Londergan replied: “Sarena: We would like to get your clients’ depositions scheduled in the same timeframe, if possible. Would you please send us some dates that Ms. Thomas and Sariya are available in March/April?” He provided his contact information, including 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202; Direct Phone 502.625.1678; Direct Fax 502.779.9336.\n\nAt 11:04 a.m. on February 10, Sarena responded: “Awesome, sounds great. We will get a notice over to you & the court reporter today.” This message, like others, included her Whaley Law Firm header and contact details.\n\nEarlier on February 10, at 10:24 a.m., Matthew Londergan had noted that the conference room at his office would be available that day and that Whaley could decide the order of deposition proceedings. He stated: “Whichever order you all would prefer to do the depositions in is fine with us.”\n\nAt 9:46 a.m. on February 10, Sarena wrote: “Good morning Matthew, March 6, 2025 beginning at 10:00a with Mrs. Vilches and continuing with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon or vice versa, works for our office. Do you mind if we use your office for the convenience of the parties?” This message again carried the standard firm signature block.\n\nOn February 7, 2025, at 3:38 p.m., Matthew Londergan had previously replied to Bryce Koon: “Bryce: Sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this. Both of our clients are available on any of the following dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6, any time; Thursday, March 13, any time; Thursday, March 27, any time. We have confirmed that we will need a Spanish interpreter for these depositions. Let me know if these dates do not work for you, and we will obtain some more possible dates. In talking to our clients, Thursdays generally work best.” His note included his contact details.\n\nOn January 24, 2025 at 12:25 p.m., Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Deanna M. Tucker, Kristy M. King, and Matthew Londergan, with Sariya Mason DB in the CC line and a Filevine project email address associated with Sariya Mason. The subject line referenced the same case. Bryce wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, We are again attempting to obtain dates for your client's depositions. Please provide dates in February or March for when these can be conducted. Thank you, W. Bryce Koon, Esq.” His signature block provided the firm’s address and contact information, including the phone number (502) 365-5043 and fax number (502) 237-3207. An image attachment note appeared, with a standard confidentiality disclaimer stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and advising recipients to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error.\n\nEarlier still, on January 17, 2025, at 2:22 p.m., Sarena Tuttle wrote to counsel: “Good afternoon Counsel, We just wanted to touch base again on getting deposition dates for Mrs. Vilches, we understand that Mrs. Vilches speaks some derivative of Spanish and would like confirmation of her native language as well. Please provide this information as soon as possible to avoid any further delays as this claim is over 2.5 years old with video footage of the incident, showing an unprovoked attack. We further understand that your clients tend to leave the United States to visit family, and that a Zoom deposition may be best, though not ideal.” The note ends mid-sentence with “If you,” indicating that the message was truncated. The thread included the same confidentiality notices commonly attached to transmissions of that firm.\n\nIn summary, the communications between The Whaley Law Firm and SBM KY Law from mid-January to early February 2025 focused on scheduling depositions for the parties involved in Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., establishing that a Spanish interpreter would be required, arranging dates (with a preference for Thursdays), and coordinating the use of either counsel’s office to facilitate the depositions. The deposition targets include Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo, with arrangements involving Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason as named deponents, and a Spanish translator to be provided for those proceedings.",

      "natural_language": "Case overview: This note concerns the Sariya Mason client (Sariya Mason, DB 08/19/2022) in Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al.,Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039.\n\nChronology of communications:\n\n- January 24, 2025: Bryce Koon, Esq., on behalf of The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Deanna M. Tucker, Kristy M. King, Matthew Londergan, and others (including a Filevine project address for Sariya Mason) requesting dates in February or March for the depositions. The message was a general follow-up requesting deposition dates.\n\n- February 7, 2025, 3:38 PM: Matthew R. Londergan, attorney, replied with potential deposition dates for both clients: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 any time; Thursday, March 13 any time; Thursday, March 27 any time. He noted that a Spanish interpreter would be required for these depositions and invited Bryce to advise if these dates did not work to obtain additional options, adding that Thursdays generally work best for their clients.\n\n- February 9, 2025, 9:46 AM: Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, responded to Matthew. She proposed March 6, 2025 beginning at 10:00 a.m. with Mrs. Vilches and continuing with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon or vice versa, and asked consent to use the firm’s office for the convenience of the parties.\n\n- February 10, 2025, 10:24 AM: Matthew replied that the conference room at their office would be available that day and that the depositions could proceed in either order.\n\n- February 10, 2025, 11:04 AM: Sarena responded, “Awesome, sounds great. We will get a notice over to you & the court reporter today,” confirming next steps.\n\n- February 10, 2025, 11:16 AM: Matthew followed up, stating the desire to schedule the depositions for both clients in the same timeframe and requesting that Sarena send dates when Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available in March/April.\n\n- February 10, 2025, 11:23 AM: Sarena sent a reply with the NTTD (Notice to Take Deposition) for the Defendant’s Depositions attached. She noted that a Spanish translator had been requested and that she had sent a request to Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to check availability, promising to provide an update once responses were received.\n\n- February 11, 2025, 4:21 PM (UTC): Matthew Londergan sent an update indicating new scheduling constraints: they had learned that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, but Ms. Castillo would still be available that day. To accommodate either schedule, he proposed that, if the parties preferred to depose both witnesses on the same day, both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available at any time on one of the following alternative dates: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, or March 27. He also confirmed that a conference room at their office would be available for the depositions on any of these dates. If none of these dates work for the opponent, they would pursue dates in April. He closed by inviting a call to discuss further.\n\nOther notes and identifiers:\n- The case caption remains Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Court, 23-CI-006039.\n- The client involved in this matter is Sariya Mason (DB 08/19/2022).\n- The parties identified for deposition include Ms. Vilches, Ms. Castillo, and involvement of Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason.\n- A Spanish interpreter is required for these depositions.\n- The depositions were proposed to be held at the Whaley Law Firm office, with a conference room reserved for convenience.\n- The communications included a series of confirmations, notices to court reporters, and requests to check availability, with a standing offer to adjust dates into April if needed.\n- Contact details for the participants include:\n  - Matthew R. Londergan, Attorney, 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202. Direct Phone: 502.625.1678; Direct Fax: 502.779.9336.\n  - Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Direct Phone: 502-357-9971; Office: 502-583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (new address noted).\n- In the email footnotes, confidentiality notices were included in each message, indicating the communications are privileged and intended only for the named recipients.\n\nIn summary, the parties are coordinating deposition dates for Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., with a plan to depoise Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo (and possibly Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason) around mid-to-late March, considering March 13, 18, 20, 25, or 27 as potential options if March 6 proves infeasible due to Ms. Vilches’ travel. A Spanish translator was requested, and a court-notice to the court reporter was planned. The Whaley Law Firm offered their conference room for the depositions and remains open to adjusting to April if needed.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the email communications and scheduling discussions between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKY Law Firm, dated February 7 through March 13, 2025, concerning the deposition planning for Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al. in the Jeff Cir Court, case number 23-CI-006039, with Sariya Mason as the client.\n\nOn February 7, 2025 at 3:38 PM, Matthew R. Londergan (Attorney, SBMKY Law) informed Bryce that both clients are available on several dates: Thursday, February 20 after 11 a.m.; Thursday, March 6 any time; Thursday, March 13 any time; and Thursday, March 27 any time. He noted that a Spanish interpreter would be needed for these depositions and that Thursdays generally work best; if the listed dates did not work, they would obtain additional dates. His contact details were provided, and a confidentiality notice accompanied the message.\n\nOn February 9 or 10, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied. In a message sent at 9:46 AM on February 10, she stated that March 6, 2025, beginning at 10:00 a.m., would work for their office, with Ms. Vilches first and Ms. Castillo in the afternoon, or vice versa; she asked whether they could use the sending office for the depositions to accommodate the parties. Her signature included her title, the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and her direct line. A confidentiality notice was included in the email.\n\nLater on February 10, 2025 at 11:04 AM, Sarena responded again: “Awesome, sounds great. We will get a notice over to you & the court reporter today,” reaffirming the plan and indicating they would issue the deposition notice to both the opposing party and the court reporter. This email also carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 11:16 AM on February 10, 2025, Matthew Londergan replied that they would like to schedule his clients’ depositions in the same timeframe and asked Sarena to send dates when Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available in March or April. His message included his office address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, and his direct contact numbers, along with the confidentiality notice.\n\nIn a follow-up at 11:23 AM on February 10, 2025, Sarena sent the email with the attached NTTD (Notice to Take Depositions) for the defendants’ depositions and noted that they had requested a Spanish translator for the day. She also stated she had sent a request to Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason to check their availability and that she would update SBMKY as soon as she heard back. Her signature block again listed The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and new email address.\n\nSarena’s earlier message from February 10, 2025 at 11:04 AM was preceded by an earlier note stating, “Awesome, sounds great. We will get a notice over to you & the court reporter today,” confirming that a notice would be issued promptly.\n\nOn February 10, 2025 at 9:46 AM, Sarena had proposed the detailed schedule for March 6, 2025: beginning at 10:00 a.m. with Mrs. Vilches and continuing with Mrs. Castillo in the afternoon, or the order could be reversed; she asked whether it would be acceptable to use The Whaley Law Firm’s office for the depositions to facilitate the process.\n\nBy February 11, 2025 at 11:21 AM, Matthew informed Sarena that they had learned Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6. Ms. Castillo remained available on that day, but if the parties preferred to conduct both depositions on the same day, they had confirmed that both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available on any of the following days: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27. They also noted that a conference room was available at their office for the depositions on any of these dates, and they offered to arrange dates in April if none of the listed dates worked for the other side. He concluded by inviting a discussion over the phone if needed. His signature block again provided his office details: 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, with direct phone and fax numbers and the confidentiality notice.\n\nLater on February 11, 2025 at 12:58:38 PM, Sarena replied to Matthew: “Good afternoon Matt, Thank you for the update & dates. We can move it to the 13th without an issue.” She confirmed acceptance of the proposed March 13 date and repeated that they could shift to that date given the updated availability, and she provided her contact details, including her new email address at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct lines and email. The message itself did not include any additional scheduling details beyond confirming the March 13 option, but it did reiterate the shift to that date and acknowledged the update.\n\nAcross these exchanges, several consistent points appear: the depositions pertain to the Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al. matter in Jeff Cir Court, case 23-CI-006039; the clients involved include Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo, with Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason also mentioned for scheduling; a Spanish interpreter has been requested for the deposition day; The Whaley Law Firm offered use of its office space (including a conference room) to accommodate the depositions; the parties discussed scheduling across several potential dates, primarily in March 2025, with some consideration of April if needed; and the communications repeatedly included confidentiality notices and standard firm contact information, including the firm’s address, phone numbers, and Sarena’s new email address.\n\nIn sum, the correspondence documents a coordinated effort in February 2025 to schedule the depositions of the involved parties, balancing the availability of Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo, arranging for a Spanish translator, securing a conference room, and aligning dates so that the depositions for these related matters could be conducted efficiently, ultimately confirming March 13, 2025 as a feasible date for the depositions with permission to proceed on that day.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note covers communications regarding the deposition schedule in the matter Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, Jeff Cir Court, 23-CI-006039.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, the Whaley Law Firm alerted SBMKY Law that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available for depositions on March 18, 2025. The message came from Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and included the firm’s contact details.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Matthew R. Londergan of SBMKY Law had indicated they would inform their clients of potential dates. In response to scheduling needs, Sarena confirmed on February 10, 2025 that the defendants’ depositions would be conducted, beginning March 6, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. with Mrs. Vilches and continuing with Mrs. Castillo, and noted that a Spanish translator had been requested for that day. She also indicated she had sent a request to Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to check their availability and would provide an update as soon as she heard back. The same day, SBMKY stated that the conference room at their office would be available for the depositions on that date, and that the order of the depositions could be arranged as Whaley preferred.\n\nLater that day, SBMKY reiterated that the conference room would be available and that they were flexible about the order of the depositions. On February 10, 2025 at 11:23 a.m., Sarena attached the Notice to Take Depositions (NTTD) for the Defendant’s Depositions and noted that a Spanish translator had been requested for the day; she also said she had asked Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to check their availability and would update Londergan as soon as she heard back.\n\nAt 11:21 a.m. on February 11, 2025, Londergan informed that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, but Ms. Castillo would be available that day. He also indicated that if both depositions were to be conducted on the same day, both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available on any of these dates: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, or March 27. A conference room at SBMKY’s office would be available on any of these dates, and if none of these dates worked for the opposing office, dates in April could be arranged. He invited further discussion by phone.\n\nSarena responded on February 11, 2025 at 12:59 p.m., indicating that they could move the deposition to March 13 without issue. Matthew replied later that day at 1:22 p.m., saying they would inform their clients. Earlier in the thread, the initial note had stated that the depositions were to begin March 6, 2025 with Vilches and continue with the other party, with the possibility of rescheduling if needed.\n\nIn sum, the deposition plan involved coordinating the depositions of Mrs. Vilches and Mrs. Castillo around early March 2025, with contingencies for May/April dates if necessary, a Spanish translator for the day, and a conference-room venue. On February 11, 2025, it was noted that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025, adding to the schedule of potential dates and confirming continued communication among all counsel.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Crt, 23-CI-006039, the scheduling communications were exchanged in February 2025 between The Whaley Law Firm and Sariya Mason’s counsel, as part of the Sariya-Mason-DB file dated August 19, 2022. The depositions at issue involve Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason, with defendants including Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo, and the team planned to hold the depositions at the Whaley Law Firm office.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm began outlining the plan. In a morning message, she stated that March 6, 2025 would begin at 10:00 a.m. with Mrs. Vilches and would continue with the other deponent. Matthew Londergan replied later that day, noting that the conference room at his office would be available that day and that Whaley could determine the deposition order. He followed up that same day by expressing readiness to send a notice to the court reporter and to coordinate with the clients.\n\nEarlier that morning, multiple messages circulated regarding dates and coordination. Matthew asked for dates in March or April when Ms. Thomas and Sariya would be available, and Sarena attached a Notice to Take Depositions (NTTD) for the defendants’ depositions, along with a request for a Spanish translator for that day and a request for Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to confirm their availability. Kristy M. King, the legal assistant for Sariya Mason, also included a confidentiality notice in her communications.\n\nOver the next hours, the parties discussed adjusting the schedule. Sarena indicated they could move the deposition date to March 13. Matthew noted that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, but that Ms. Castillo would be available that day; he also advised that if both depositions were to occur on the same day, they had confirmed that both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available on any of the following mutually workable dates: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27. The Whaley team requested flexibility on the date and reminded that a conference room would be available at their office for whichever order the depositions occurred. If none of those dates worked, they suggested moving to April.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, further updates were exchanged. An earlier message from Matthew had requested that the parties’ availability be provided for March/April, and Sarena replied that they could move the depositions to March 13. Matthew followed by confirming that Ms. Vilches would now be unavailable on March 6, but that Ms. Castillo would still be available that day; the group remained open to scheduling both depositions on the same day on one of the dates listed (March 13, 18, 20, 25, or 27), with a court reporter and a conference room arranged at the office. She noted that they would update as soon as they heard back.\n\nSarena then informed Matthew that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025. In parallel, Kristy M. King circulated that the 10:00 a.m. start time at The Whaley Law Firm’s office was being considered for the depositions.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, new contact details surfaced: Sarena Tuttle noted a new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) for future correspondence, and Kristy M. King’s signature appeared with the Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and the firm’s phone and fax numbers.\n\nIn summary, the parties coordinated multiple schedules for the depositions in Schrice Thomas v. Castillo et al., with initial plans to begin on March 6, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. (Vilches first, then Castillo), the option to conduct both depositions on the same day, and subsequent adjustments moving toward March 13 or March 18, 2025, while ensuring a court reporter, a Spanish translator, an NTTD, and a suitable conference room setting were arranged.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note relates to Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., before the Jeff Cir Crt, case number 23-CI-006039. The email thread consists of communications between Matthew R. Londergan of SBMKY Law and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with multiple recipients on CC and by email, concerning scheduling depositions for the defendants and the related Notice to Take Deposition (NTTD), including arrangements for a Spanish translator and a suitable venue.\n\nThe exchange began in early February 2025. On February 10, 2025, Matthew Londergan asked Sarena Tuttle to propose dates in March and April for the depositions of Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo, noting that a conference room at his office would be available for the depositions. He requested that they coordinate with their clients, Ms. Thomas and Sariya Mason, and keep him posted if anything changed. The initial message included his direct contact details and a confidentiality notice typical of attorney communications.\n\nLater on February 10, Sarena responded that they had attached the Notice to Take Depositions (NTTD) for the Defendant’s Depositions and had requested a Spanish translator for that day. She indicated that she had sent a request to Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason to check their availability and promised to update as soon as responses were received. She also provided her contact information and noted a new Whaley Law Firm email address in the chain. In a follow-up, she confirmed that they would get a notice to Matthew and the court reporter that day, reiterating the plan to coordinate the depositions.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Matthew replied that the conference room at his office was available and that either order of depositions would be acceptable. He reiterated his willingness to accommodate the scheduling and to notify the clients accordingly. Sarena then attached the NTTD and again affirmed the availability of a Spanish translator, along with the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nLater on February 11, 2025, Sarena indicated that they could move the depositions to March 13 without issue. In response, Matthew noted that he had learned Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, and that while Ms. Castillo was available that day, they could schedule both depositions on the same day if desired. He reported that both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available on any of the following days: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, or March 27, and he reminded that a conference room was available at their office for the depositions. He also offered to discuss further if needed. This message thread contains the standard confidentiality notices on each email.\n\nOn February 11, 2025 at 12:59 PM, Sarena confirmed once more that they could move to March 13. At 1:22 PM, Matthew responded, “Great, thank you. We will let our clients know.” Later that same day, Sarena informed Matthew that they had just heard back from Mrs. Thomas, and that both Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025. In the final note from February 11, 2025 at 7:12 PM, Matthew thanked her and stated that they would get the depositions noticed for their office on March 18, and asked to be informed if anything changed in the meantime.\n\nAcross the thread, the parties discussed the Notice to Take Depositions, arranged for a Spanish translator, and coordinated availability for two defendants’ depositions—Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo—while reserving the office conference room for the proceedings. The stated plan, as of the latest update, is to notice the depositions for March 18, 2025, with flexibility to adjust to alternative dates (March 13, 18, 20, 25, 27) if needed, and to proceed with both depositions on the same day if feasible.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., Jefferson Circuit Court, 23-CI-006039, was the subject of a series of scheduling emails in February 2025 involving the representation for Sariya Mason (the client) and counsel for the other side. The Whaley Law Firm, on behalf of Sariya Mason, coordinated depositions in the matter with SBMKY Law. In the initial exchange, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent to Kristy M. King and cc’d colleagues a notice that included an attached Notice to Take the Deposition of the Defendant (NTTD) and a request for a Spanish translator for the day, noting that she had reached out to Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to check their availability and would provide updates.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Kristy M. King asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start at their office would be acceptable for the depositions. In reply, Sarena confirmed a positive response: “Absolutely. Thank you so much,” and signed with her updated contact information. Earlier that same day, Kristy’s team had proposed a potential schedule, and Matthew R. Londergan, an attorney for SBMKY, had asked for dates in March and April to align depositions for Ms. Thomas and Sariya.\n\nLater on February 10, 2025, Sarena told Matthew that they could move the deposition date to the 13th without issue. The next day, February 11, 2025, Matthew informed Sarena that they had learned Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, and that Ms. Castillo was available that day. He added that, if both depositions were to occur on the same day, they had confirmed that both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available at any time on the following dates: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27, and that a conference room would be available at their office for the depositions on any of those dates; if none of these dates worked for the other office, they could pursue dates in April. \n\nSarena replied that the plan sounded good and that they would issue a notice to the court reporter that day. A subsequent message from Sarena to Matthew acknowledged the new dates, stating that moving the deposition to the 13th was not a problem. Matthew then responded, thanking her and saying they would inform their clients. Later that day, Sarena noted that they had heard back from Mrs. Thomas, who, along with Sariya Mason, would be available on March 18, 2025. Kristy then inquired about starting the depositions at 10:00 a.m. at their office, to which Sarena replied, “Absolutely. Thank you so much, Kristy,” and signed her message with her full contact information, including her new email address.\n\nFor reference, the communications included the following contact details and identifiers: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address). Kristy M. King’s office address appeared as 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202, with direct phone 502-625-1706 and direct fax 502-583-4780. The depositions were to be held in the presenting firm’s conference room, with dates proposed for March 13, 18, 20, 25, and 27, and a March 6 option previously discussed due to Ms. Vilches’ travel, all subject to the availability of Mrs. Thomas (Schrice Thomas) and Sariya Mason for the day and the possible need for a Spanish translator.",

In that message, she advised that the Defense has requested the deposition be moved to March 13, 2025. The deposition time remains 10:00 a.m., and the location remains DC Office, 401 W.

The response came from the Kentuckiana Reporters Scheduling Team, which included Kristina Rahm, McKenna Watson, and Madison Elam, and provided standard contact details: P: 502-589-2273; E: Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com; A: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202. The department also included their cancellation policy, which states that a cancellation fee applies for all assignments canceled with less than 24 hours’ notice, and that interpreter requests canceled within 24 hours will be billed at the industry standard of a 2-hour minimum rate.\n\nAdditionally, the donotreply message from Kentuckiana Reporters, sent on February 10, 2025 at 11:14 AM, confirms a new submission from 20 Second Scheduler. It lists the Name as Sarena Tuttle and the Email as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the Additional Comments: “Def Deposition x2 - In Person - DC Office - Spanish Translator Required.” The notice attached to that submission is named 2025.02.10-Mason-NTTD-Defs-03.06.2025-10a-EST-DC-Office.pdf.\n\nIn sum, the latest plan is to hold two depositions in person at the DC Office in Louisville, Kentucky, with a Spanish translator required, under the updated schedule moving the deposition to March 13, 2025 at 10:00 a.m., at 401 W.

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This matter concerns a new submission from 20 Second Scheduler. The thread begins with an email from the Scheduling Department at Kentuckiana Reporters to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, dated February 12, 2025 at 16:06:56 UTC, acknowledging the submission and stating that they would update their records. The Scheduling Team signature includes Kristina Rahm, McKenna Watson, and Madison Elam, with contact information for Kentuckiana Reporters: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-589-2273; email Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on February 10, 2025 at 11:14 AM, a message from donotreply@kentuckianareporters.com on behalf of donotreply@kentuckianareporters.com was sent to Scheduling Department. It was sent by Sarena Tuttle (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and included the following details in the Additional Comments: Def Deposition x2 - In Person - DC Office - Spanish Translator Required. It also included a Notice file titled 2025.02.10-Mason-NTTD-Defs-03.06.2025-10a-EST-DC-Office.pdf.\n\nThe Scheduling Department replied about an hour later, at 11:56 AM, confirming that they would add these to their calendar and work on reserving a Spanish interpreter. Their reply came from the Kentuckiana Reporters Scheduling Team and reiterated their cancellation policy: a cancellation fee will apply for any assignment cancelled with less than 24-hours’ notice, and interpreter cancellations within 24 hours are billed at the industry standard of a 2-hour minimum rate. The standard signature block appeared, listing Kristina Rahm, McKenna Watson, and Madison Elam, along with the same contact details for Kentuckiana Reporters.\n\nOn February 12, 2025 at 10:16 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note that a new email address is in use), responded to Scheduling Department. She informed them that the Defense had requested the deposition be moved to March 13, 2025. The time remained 10:00 AM, and the location remained the DC Office at 401 W. Main Street, 16th Floor, Louisville, KY 40202. She also noted that a translator would still be required and advised that an Amended Notice was attached for discussion.\n\nLater that same day, February 12, 2025, at 16:06 UTC, the Scheduling Department replied to Sarena with, “Got it! We’ll get this updated on our end. Thanks!” The message was sent under the Kentuckiana Reporters Scheduling Team, and the signature block again listed Kristina Rahm, McKenna Watson, and Madison Elam, along with the same contact details and the repeated cancellation policy.\n\nAcross these communications, the following additional contextual details appear in the chain: the initial submission was titled “New submission from 20 Second Scheduler,” and the Amended Notice referenced by Sarena was attached in her February 12 message. The record also shows the inclusion of standard cancellation terms—the 24-hour notice rule and the 2-hour minimum for interpreter cancellations. The parties’ contact details appear repeatedly: The Whaley Law Firm’s contact page shows Sarena’s address and numbers, including the note to use the new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. Kentuckiana Reporters’ contact details are also included, with their Louisville office address, phone number, and email.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022\nClient: Sariya Mason\n\nThis record concerns the matter Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al, in Jeff Cir Crt, case number 23-CI-006039. The deposition scheduling communications involve counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and from SBMKY Law, with the Plaintiffs Mr. Vilches, Mrs. Castillo, Mrs. Thomas, and Sariya Mason referenced in various positions in the thread. The note begins with a recent scheduling conflict raised by Kristy M. King, a legal assistant, on March 17, 2025, who asked for new dates after advising of a conflict for tomorrow and noting the need to reschedule the Plaintiffs’ depositions.\n\nIn the run-up to these dates, the calendar coordination unfolded through a sequence of emails in February 2025. On February 10, 2025, Matthew R. Londergan, an attorney with the Whaley/Belmont group, requested that the two depositions—those of Ms. Thomas and Sariya—be scheduled in the same timeframe and asked for dates in March or April that would work for the counsel and the Plaintiffs. The response from Sarena M. Tuttle was prompt. She indicated “Absolutely” and sent back information, noting that the firm had attached the NTTD (Notice to Take Depositions) for the Defendant’s Depositions and that a Spanish translator was being requested for that day. She also said she had asked Mrs. Thomas and Sariya to check their availability and that she would provide updates as soon as she heard back.\n\nEarlier in the day, there was an initial note from Sarena replying “Awesome” to the request, followed by further detail in the subsequent communications. Also on February 10, 2025, Sarena referenced that Kristy had asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start at SBMKY’s office would be suitable for the depositions.\n\nThe thread then shows a key development on February 11, 2025. Matthew Londergan informed Sarena that they had learned Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6. Ms. Castillo would still be available on that date, and the two depositions could be conducted on the same day if desired. The teams confirmed that Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo would be available at any time on any of the following days: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27. A conference room at their office was also available on these dates. They noted that if none of these dates worked for the other office, April dates could be considered.\n\nIn response to the proposed dates, Sarena advised that they could move the deposition to March 13 without issue. Matthew responded that they would inform their clients. Sarena then noted that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya had responded and would be available on March 18, 2025. Kristy asked for confirmation about a 10:00 a.m. start at their office for the depositions, and Sarena replied with “Awesome,” confirming readiness to proceed under that arrangement.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the communications repeatedly referenced confidentiality notices attached to each email and the need to handle discovery with attorney-client/work product privileges preserved.\n\nBy February 11, 2025, the parties had established potential dates on which both Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo could be deposed (March 13, 18, 20, 25, or 27), with arrangements for a conference room at the defense office if needed, and with the additional detail that a Spanish translator would be requested for the day. The availability updates indicated that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025, and that the 10:00 a.m. start at the defense office was being considered.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Kristy M. King sent a new email noting a scheduling conflict for tomorrow and requesting that additional dates be provided that would work for both counsel and the Plaintiffs, Sariya Mason and Mrs. Thomas, in order to reschedule the Plaintiffs’ depositions. She asked for alternative dates and apologized for the late notice.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects a coordinated effort in February 2025 to schedule the depositions of the Plaintiffs in Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., with proposed dates including March 13, 18, 20, 25, and 27, consideration of Ms. Vilches and Ms. Castillo’s availability, a plan to use a conference room at the defense office, and a request for a 10:00 a.m. start on the days chosen. By mid-March, a scheduling conflict prompted a request for additional date options to accommodate counsel and the Plaintiffs, including Sariya Mason and Mrs. Thomas. Throughout, confidentiality notices accompanied each message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note concerns the deposition scheduling for plaintiffs in Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Court, 23-CI-006039. The communications involve The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for Sariya Mason) and SBMKY Law (Kristy M. King, Matthew R. Londergan, Bryce Koon, Deanna M. Tucker, Benji Smith). The thread covers proposed dates, available slots, and changes due to conflicts, with repeated references to the new email address for Sarena.\n\nOn February 10, 2025, Sarena Tuttle told Matthew Londergan: “Absolutely,” and noted that she attached the NTTD for the Defendant’s Depositions and that they had requested a Spanish Tr—the line ends at “Tr” in the record. In her signature, she also indicated a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. Earlier messages dated February 11, 2025 show the parties discussing available dates and logistics for the depositions. Matthew Londergan replied that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, but Ms. Castillo would be available that day; if both depositions were to be on the same day, they could be scheduled on any of the following days: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, or March 27, with a conference room available at their office. He also noted that if none of those dates worked, they would propose dates in April. He added that he would let their clients know. Earlier in the thread, Sarena had indicated that they could move the deposition date to the 13th without issue, and Matthew confirmed their clients’ availability for the proposed dates, including Mrs. Thomas and Sariya being available on March 18, 2025.\n\nKristy M. King also contributed to the scheduling discussion, asking on February 11, 2025 at 2:12 p.m. whether a 10:00 a.m. start at their office would be okay for the depositions. In response, Sarena Tuttle affirmed with a brief reply at 2:45 p.m., saying, “Absolutely. Thank you so much Kristy,” and again providing her contact details with the new address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on February 11, 2025 at 12:59 p.m., Sarena told Matthew that they could move the deposition to the 13th without issue. In a separate message, dated February 11, 2025 at 1:50 p.m., Sarena also advised that they had heard back from Mrs. Thomas, and that both Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025.\n\nContinuing the exchange, on February 11, 2025 at 1:22 p.m., Matthew wrote, “Awesome. We also just heard back from Mrs. Thomas. Her & Sariya will be available on March 18, 2025.” He later thanked Sarena for the update, saying they would relay the information to their clients. The thread also notes a conference room would be available for the depositions at SBMKY’s office on the dates discussed, and that if the proposed dates did not work, April dates would be sought.\n\nIn the later portion of the exchange, on February 10–11, 2025, Sarena reiterated the attached NTTD for the Defendant’s Depositions and their request for a Spanish translator (the line ends with “Tr,” indicating the sentence was not completed in the record). The thread includes repeated confidentiality notices common to these attorney communications, along with signatures that consistently display Sarena’s new email address.\n\nFinally, on March 17, 2025, Kristy M. King reported a scheduling conflict for tomorrow and requested additional dates that would work for counsel and plaintiffs, apologizing for the late notice. In response, later that same day, Sarena acknowledged the conflict, stated that the beginning of April is tricky due to Spring Break and vacations, and proposed looking at dates the week after Easter. She listed April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1 as open and asked which of those dates would work best for Kristy’s office.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes the scheduling communications for depositions in the case Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Crt, 23-CI-006039, with client Sariya Mason. The involved law firms are The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, and colleagues Matthew Londergan, Bryce Koon, Deanna M. Tucker, and Benji Smith) and SBM Kentucky Law ( Kristy M. King, a Legal Assistant, and Mr. Matthew Londergan as the client contact). The depositions at issue concern Plaintiffs, including Sariya Mason, and the parties have been coordinating through email exchanges that span February and March 2025. Each email contained a confidentiality notice stating that the communication and attachments are confidential and privileged and should be treated accordingly.\n\nBeginning in mid-February 2025, the parties discussed dates for the plaintiffs’ depositions and the logistics of where and when they would occur. In a February 11 exchange, the Whaley firm advised that the depositions could be moved to March 13 without issue, and that the depositions could be held in their office with a conference room available for use on any of the proposed dates. They noted that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, and that Ms. Castillo would be available on that day if both depositions were desired on the same day. The Whaley team listed several potential dates for depositions: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27, with the option to reschedule into April if those dates did not work. They also indicated that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025. In addition, they proposed a 10:00 a.m. start time for the depositions at their office. Matthew Londergan acknowledged the proposed dates and noted that he would inform their clients.\n\nLater on February 11, 2025, Matthew Londergan confirmed that Ms. Vilches would be unavailable on March 6 due to being out of the country, but that Ms. Castillo remained available on that date. He reiterated the available dates for scheduling: March 13, March 18, March 20, March 25, and March 27, with a conference room available at their office. He suggested that if both depositions could be held on the same day, they would coordinate accordingly. The Whaley team responded affirmatively to the 10:00 a.m. start time, and the exchange continued with further confirmations about the dates and client availability. Matthew later indicated that he would inform their clients of the proposed schedule, and Sarena replied, “Absolutely,” expressing appreciation for Kristy’s coordination.\n\nIn the same February 11 thread, there is a rapid back-and-forth about timing and client availability. The Whaley team confirmed that moving to March 13 was acceptable, and they provided the March 18 availability for Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason. They also confirmed that depositions could start at 10:00 a.m. at the SBM Kentucky office, and that a conference room would be available for the depositions. The sequence also shows ongoing coordination regarding whether both depositions should occur on the same day and how best to accommodate the calendar constraints, with the parties showing flexibility about April dates if March dates proved impractical.\n\nBy March 17, 2025, scheduling again required adjustment due to conflicts in early April. Kristy M. King conveyed that there had been a scheduling conflict for the next day and asked for additional dates that would work for counsel and the Plaintiffs. She noted that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1 and asked if there was a preferred date or start time. Kristy’s message closed with her standard confirmation and contact details. The Whaley firm replied with a plan to consider the later dates and asked for guidance on preferred times.\n\nIn response to Kristy’s March 17 message, Sarena Tuttle provided a clear set of alternative open dates in the week after Easter: April 22, 23, 24, 29, and 30, as well as May 1. She asked Kristy to indicate which of these dates would work best for her office. This offered window reflects ongoing collaborative scheduling between the two firms to finalize the depositions for the plaintiffs, including Sariya Mason and Mrs. Thomas, in this Jefferson Circuit Court case.\n\nAdditional context within the chain shows prior back-and-forth in February about possible start times (with at one point a suggested 10:00 a.m. start) and the availability of the parties. There are references to both Ms. Castillo and Ms. Vilches, and to coordinating depositions either on separate days or on the same day, with the option to move to April if March dates could not be arranged. Throughout, the discussions emphasize the need to accommodate Spring Breaks, vacations, and travel constraints, while securing a suitable conference-room space at the scheduling firm’s office.\n\nIn short, the parties have been negotiating depositions for Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., with plaintiffs including Sariya Mason. Initial February exchanges proposed multiple March dates (including March 13, 18, 20, 25, and 27) and a 10:00 a.m. start, subject to availability of a conference room at the filing firm’s offices. Availability updates indicated that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, and that Ms. Vilches would be out of the country on March 6, with other days available for scheduling. By mid-March, Mr. Londergan’s availability moved to late April and early May (April 29, 30, and May 1), and Sarena offered open dates in late April and early May (April 22–24, 29–30, and May 1), requesting confirmation of which option worked best for Kristy’s office. The correspondence remains confidential and privileged, as noted in each email.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya Mason\nClient: Sariya Mason\n\nThis note follows the scheduling communications for the case Schrice Thomas v Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir. Crt., 23-CI-006039. The cited case is part of a broader matter involving the client Sariya Mason, with the record kept under Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022.\n\nIn early February 2025, the parties began coordinating depositions for the Plaintiffs. Kristy M. King of SBMKY Law asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start at their office would be acceptable for the depositions. Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm confirmed that 10:00 a.m. was being considered and indicated that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025. They also discussed moving the deposition date to March 13, if needed. The thread shows that the depositions were being scheduled with the goal of minimizing delays, and that there were several dates proposed, including April 22, 23, 24, 29, and 30, and May 1, 2025, as potential options. The participants in this exchange included Sarena Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm), Matthew Londergan (SBMKY Law), Bryce Koon (Whaley Law Firm), Deanna M. Tucker (SBMKY Law), and Benji Smith (SBMKY Law). The communications were CC’d to these individuals, and the email chain contained standard confidentiality notices.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, there was a continued exchange confirming logistics. Kristy M. King asked if a 10:00 a.m. start at their office would be acceptable for the depositions. Sarena Tuttle replied that they could move the deposition to the 13th without issue. Earlier in the day, Sarena had noted that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025, and that 10:00 a.m. was a contemplated start time. Matthew Londergan acknowledged the update and said they would inform their clients. In addition, Sarena shared that they had heard back from Mrs. Thomas and that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025, and she reiterated the plan to proceed with the 13th if needed. The parties retained the confidentiality notices typical of these communications.\n\nA separate March 17, 2025 thread shows a scheduling conflict for plaintiffs’ depositions on the following day, prompting rescheduling. Kristy M. King stated that there had been a scheduling conflict for tomorrow and asked for additional dates that would work for counsel and the Plaintiffs, apologizing for the late notice. Sarena Tuttle replied that, although early April is tricky due to Spring Break and vacations, they could look at the week after Easter, with open dates of April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1. Kristy then asked for preferences among those dates and/or a preferred start time, while the records show that April 29 was eventually selected as the agreed date.\n\nIn the final exchange documented in this note, dated March 17, 2025 at 14:21:31 -0400, Sarena stated that April 29 would work for them and that they wanted to proceed as soon as possible to avoid further delays, noting that the claim was approaching three years and that there was video proof of how the incident unfolded. She proposed a 10:00 a.m. start time at the recipient’s office. Her message was signed with her contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct D: (502) 357-9971; Office: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (Please note new email address).\n\nThe thread also contains the standard confidentiality notices embedded in these emails, and lists the participating offices and points of contact, including Kristy M. King at SBMKY Law (401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202; Direct Phone: 502-625-1706; Direct Fax: 502-583-4780) and the other listed recipients and CCs (Matthew Londergan, Bryce Koon, Deanna M. Tucker, Benji Smith), as well as the Whaley Law Firm’s general contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. This note documents a series of email communications regarding depositions in Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-006039, in which the client is Sariya Mason.\n\nThe thread begins with a February 11, 2025 exchange between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKY Law. Kristy M. King, a legal assistant at SBMKY, asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start at their office would be okay for the plaintiffs’ depositions. The message was sent to Kristy by Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with a cc to Matthew Londergan and Bryce Koon, and to Deanna M. Tucker and Benji Smith. Sarena’s message included her signature block and her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com). In response, Sarena wrote, “Absolutely.” Separately, later that day Sarena noted that she and Mrs. Thomas had heard back and that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025. The email also carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nLater on February 11, Kristy asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start was feasible, and Matthew Londergan replied, saying, “Great, thank you. We will let our clients know.” In a subsequent message, Sarena confirmed again that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025. The thread shows multiple back-and-forths among Sarena, Kristy, and Matthew, with cc’d colleagues Bryce Koon, Deanna M. Tucker, and Benji Smith.\n\nOn February 11, 2025 at around 1:50–2:45 p.m., Sarena responded to earlier discussions with updates about availability. The exchange confirms that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025, and that a 10:00 a.m. start at the SBMKY office had been discussed. It also documents Sarena’s ongoing coordination and her updated contact information from The Whaley Law Firm (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note the new email address).\n\nThe timeline moves to March 17, 2025, when a scheduling conflict for plaintiffs’ depositions arose. Kristy informed stakeholders that there was a scheduling conflict for tomorrow and asked for additional dates that would work for counsel and the plaintiffs. Kristy asked for preferred dates and start times. In response, Sarena stated that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1, and asked whether there was a preference among those dates or a preferred start time.\n\nSarena then communicated that April 29 was acceptable and urged keeping the deposition as soon as possible to avoid further delays, noting that the claim is approaching three years and that there is video proof of how the incident unfolded. She proposed a start time of 10:00 a.m. at Kristy’s office. The message concluded with Sarena’s standard sign-off and contact details, including her updated email address.\n\nKristy replied that she would issue an Amended Notice. In a separate March 17 message, Sarena reiterated that the parties preferred moving forward promptly and reiterated the availability window discussed earlier. She also restated the open dates for the week after Easter: April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1, and noted that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1, with a request for a preferred start time.\n\nEarlier on March 17, Kristy had requested additional possible dates due to a scheduling conflict for the following day and apologized for the late notice. Sarena confirmed that April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1 were open for consideration. The thread includes the typical confidentiality notices in each email.\n\nThe thread also reflects an earlier exchange from February 11, 2025, in which Sarena confirmed that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025, and that the depositions could begin at 10:00 a.m. at the office. The notes remind readers that the communications included the parties’ respective contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (new email address); Kristy M. King’s contact details at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202; Direct Phone: 502-625-1706; Direct Fax: 502-583-4780. The chain of emails shows ongoing coordination among the two firms and the plaintiffs, with the guiding objective of scheduling depositions promptly given the elapsed time in the case and the availability of the involved parties.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason. The matter at hand is Schrice Thomas v Yanely Castillo et al., in Jeff Cir. Crt., case number 23-CI-006039. The exchange below concerns scheduling the plaintiffs’ depositions in this matter, with involvement from The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle) and SBMKY Law (Kristy M. King, Matthew Londergan, and other firm personnel).\n\nIn mid-February 2025, Kristy M. King, a legal assistant at SBMKY Law in Louisville, first proposed a 10:00 a.m. start for the plaintiffs’ depositions at SBMKY’s office. The email was sent on February 11, 2025, to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm, with copies to Matthew Londergan and other colleagues, and included Kristy’s standard confidentiality notice. Kristy asked whether a 10:00 a.m. start at SBMKY’s office would work for the depositions.\n\nLater that same day, Sarena replied that they could move the deposition date to the 13th without issue and also noted that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18, 2025. In the same thread, Sarena stated that they had just heard back from Mrs. Thomas, and that she and Sariya Mason would be available on March 18. Matthew Londergan replied that they would inform their clients. A fragment of the thread also indicated that Ms. Vilches would now be out of the [incomplete phrase ends here], though the exact circumstance was not fully captured in the note.\n\nConcurrent with those exchanges, Kristy asked whether there was a preference among the dates Mr. Londergan’s schedule could accommodate for the depositions—specifically noting that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1. Sarena hadn’t yet fixed a date beyond March 18, but she later responded that April 29 could work for them, and she and Mr. Londergan discussed the preferred start time.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, after Kristy’s initial scheduling inquiry, Sarena followed up again, indicating that they could move the depositions to the 13th if needed and confirming that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya would be available on March 18, 2025. Shortly thereafter, Matthew Londergan confirmed that they would notify their clients of the proposed dates.\n\nBy mid-March, scheduling tensions resurfaced as Kristy reported a conflict for the following day and requested additional dates that would work for counsel and Plaintiffs. Sarena acknowledged the conflict and explained that early April would be tricky due to Spring Break and vacations, but she proposed looking at the week after Easter with open dates including April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1. Kristy then asked for a preference among the dates of April 29, 30, or May 1, as those were the days Mr. Londergan was available, and she inquired about a preferred start time.\n\nSarena responded that April 29, 2025 was fine for them, noting that Mrs. Thomas and Sariya Mason would be available on that date, and she reminded that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1. Kristy confirmed the readline about dates and asked if there was a preferred start time. In response, Sarena reiterated that April 29 was acceptable for their side and that they would proceed accordingly, reaffirming their availability.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, Kristy confirmed the plan and stated that she would issue an Amended Notice. Specifically, Kristy wrote, Sounds good. I’ll get an Amended Notice out. This marked the intended formalization of the agreed deposition schedule.\n\nThroughout the thread, each email included the standard confidentiality notices common to attorney communications, indicating the content was intended solely for the named recipients and protected by attorney-work product privileges, with instructions to notify the sender if received in error and to destroy the transmission.\n\nIn sum: the parties were coordinating depositions for Schrice Thomas v Yanely Castillo et al. (Jeff Cir Crt, 23-CI-006039), with Sariya Mason and Mrs. Thomas as plaintiffs. Initial discussions in February proposed a 10:00 a.m. start at SBMKY’s office, with March 18, 2025 as a target date for availability. Scheduling conflicts and spring break concerns followed, leading to a focus on the week after Easter and potential dates of April 22-24, 29-30, or May 1, with Mr. Londergan available on April 29, 30, and May 1. Ultimately, on March 17, 2025, Kristy King indicated she would issue an Amended Notice to reflect the agreed schedule.",

      "natural_language": "Case note for client Sariya Mason concerns depositions in the matter of Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Crt, case number 23-CI-006039. The depositions were being coordinated between The Whaley Law Firm and SBMKY Law, with communications involving W. Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm), Kristy M. King (Legal Assistant at SBMKY Law), Sarena Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm), Matthew Londergan (SBMKY), and Deanna M. Tucker (SBMKY). The depositions were ultimately scheduled for April 29, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., to be held at Kristy M. King’s office at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. The note records that the clients were to attend, and that the depositions were set to proceed as soon as possible to avoid further delays, noting that the claim had been pending for nearly three years and that video evidence existed showing how the incident unfolded.\n\nThe chronology begins with scheduling discussions in early 2025. On February 11, 2025, Kristy M. King asked if a 10:00 a.m. start at SBMKY’s office would be acceptable for the plaintiffs’ depositions. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle replied affirmatively, indicating “Absolutely,” and noting that they had just heard back from Mrs. Thomas. Kristy followed with a confirmation that the 10:00 a.m. start at SBMKY’s office would be suitable, and Sarena acknowledged with a brief positive reply. The February 11 exchanges also included standard confidentiality language typical of such communications.\n\nThe scheduling discussion continued on March 17, 2025, reflecting an initial scheduling conflict. Kristy M. King advised that Mr. Londergan was available on April 29, 30, and May 1, and asked for preferences regarding dates or a start time. Sarena Tuttle responded that the early April timeframe was difficult due to Spring Break and vacations, but that they could consider the week after Easter, listing open dates of April 22, 23, 24, 29, 30, or May 1 and asking which date would work best for the opponent’s office. In a follow-up, Sarena explicitly confirmed that April 29th would work for them and that they preferred a 10:00 a.m. start at the opponent’s office.\n\nBy late March, the parties had settled on April 29, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. for the plaintiffs’ depositions at Kristy King’s office. Kristy King’s March 17, 2025 messages and Sarena Tuttle’s responses reflected the agreed-upon 10:00 a.m. start and the preference to proceed on April 29 to avoid additional delays. The record also shows ongoing back-and-forth among the attorneys and staff about the scheduling, with the understanding that the depositions would proceed promptly.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, the day before the scheduled depositions, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm confirmed with the SBMKY counterpart that the clients would be at the opposing counsel’s office the following day for their depositions at 10:00 a.m. He stated, “Good afternoon counsel, I have confirmed with my clients that we will be at your office tomorrow at 10 for their depositions.” He provided his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. Kristy M. King replied later that afternoon to confirm the depositions for tomorrow, April 29, and asked to be informed if anything had changed. Kristy’s email signature included her title as Legal Assistant and her office address at 401 West Main Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, with direct phone 502-625-1706 and direct fax 502-583-4780. Each of these messages included standard confidentiality notices indicating the communications were intended only for the named recipients and may be protected by attorney-client or work product privileges; recipients were instructed to notify the sender and destroy the message if received in error.\n\nIn summary, the depositions in Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo et al., Jeff Cir Crt, 23-CI-006039, were scheduled and confirmed for April 29, 2025, at 10:00 a.m., at Kristy King’s office in Louisville, Kentucky. The depositions were to proceed for the plaintiffs, with the expectation of moving forward promptly to prevent further delays in a case nearing three years of duration, supported by video evidence of the incident. The communications included both the scheduling confirmations and the required confidentiality disclosures typical of attorney communications.",

The matter was referenced in email correspondence from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, regarding the parties and related settlement discussions.\n\nThe May 12, 2025 email: On May 12, 2025 at 9:54?AM, Bryce Koon wrote to counsel on the matter, asking whether opposing counsel would be open to mediation or continuing informal settlement talks. He noted that it might make sense to see if the dispute could be resolved before expending more time and resources, and he asked for their thoughts. The message included the standard attorney contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The signature line was followed by the customary confidentiality and privilege disclaimer, stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or otherwise protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, there is no waiver of privilege, and the information should not be used or forwarded to anyone not intended to receive it. The email header identified the sender as Bryce Koon, from The Whaley Law Firm, and was directed to counsel, with the subject referencing the Jefferson Circuit case noted above.\n\nThe May 20, 2025 follow-up email: On May 20, 2025 at 10:01:09 GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon again reached out with a follow-up message: “Good afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this one. Thanks.” This message again came from The Whaley Law Firm and included the same firm contact details in the signature block. The email was addressed to Matthew Londergan (mlondergan@sbmkylaw.com) and Deanna Tucker (DTucker@sbmkylaw.com), with Kristy M. King (kking@sbmkylaw.com) and the Sariya Mason Filevine project email address (SariyaMasonZ2040607@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) copied. The subject line continued to reference Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo, et al., Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-006039. The same confidentiality and privilege disclaimer appeared after the signature block, noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information, and instructing error recipients to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to disseminate the content.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Sariya-Mason-DB-08-19-2022. Client: Sariya Mason.\n\nIn the matter captioned Schrice Thomas v. Yanelys Castillo, et al. (Jefferson Circuit Court of Kentucky, case number 23-CI-006039), a correspondence thread was logged among counsel in early and mid-2025. On June 3, 2025, at 12:41:59 p.m. Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel Matthew Londergan and Deanna Tucker, with Kristy M. King and the Filevine project email address for Sariya Mason copied on the message. The subject line reflected the Schrice Thomas v. Castillo matter, and Koon stated in the body, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today and set for Monday's motion hour.” He signed with his full contact details for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email carried a standard attorney‑client confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the message is intended only for the named recipient, may contain privileged information, and that if it was received in error the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the material.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on May 20, 2025, at approximately 10:01 a.m. (the timestamp shown as “10:01?AM” in the record), Koon wrote to the same recipients: “Good afternoon counsel, Just wanted to follow up on this one. Thanks.” This message also carried The Whaley Law Firm’s signature block and the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nPrior to that, on May 12, 2025, at about 9:54 a.m. (noted as “9:54?AM” in the record), Koon sent another message: “Good afternoon counsel, Before moving forward, I wanted to check in to see if you’re open to mediation or continuing informal settlement talks. It might make sense to see if we can get this resolved before putting more time and resources into it. Let me know what you think.” This message likewise included the firm’s contact information and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nIn all three messages, the confidentiality disclaimer appears at the end, stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, there is no waiver of privilege, and the information should not be used or forwarded to anyone not intended to receive it.",
