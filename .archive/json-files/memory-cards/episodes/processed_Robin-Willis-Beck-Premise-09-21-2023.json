      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck \u2013 Premise-09-21-2023. Initial client contact concerns Robin Willis Beck, who was injured at the Louder Than Life festival on the evening of September 21, 2023. She states she broke her ankle while walking to the festival bathrooms, describing a hazard where grass meets concrete along a ridge with no lighting or paint to warn attendees. She attached two pictures and her ER discharge papers. Robin notes she will miss the next three days of the festival, having paid for all four days but only attending one day. She planned to proceed with crutches and was concerned about space in the ADA area and was not permitted to bring a seat into that area because it is very small. She provided her contact details: 1214 Pigeon Pass Rd, Louisville, KY 40213, 502-260-2827. A case reference in the record appears as 132712:2023007.\n\nOn September 22, 2023 at 8:42 PM, Robin emailed access@louderthanlifefestival.com describing that she broke her ankle Thursday evening and detailing the hazard near the restrooms. On September 23, 2023 at 1:29 AM, the festival responded: \u201cHello, First, we are sorry to hear about your experience. We will make sure your concerns get to festival operations. Second, since it is medically necessary are able to bring in a chair. Show this message to Security if you have any issues. If you do come, and do bring a chair, please bring a small foldable, collapsible camping style chair.\u201d This guidance was issued by Fahntoosh Enterprises Guest Services, on behalf of Danny Wimmer Presents.\n\nIn a separate exchange, on September 26, 2023 at 10:41:15 AM EDT, Robin sent another message to access@louderthanlifefestival.com asking whether there is any insurance company she can contact regarding the issue. She explained that she is already missing her second day of work and cannot return until she has seen an orthopedic surgeon, and she noted that she did not get a chance to ask anyone who helped her.\n\nOn November 7, 2023, the file shows an email chain involving attorney Bryce Koon of Whaley Law Firm. At 2:10 PM Eastern Time, Bryce sent to Robin\u2019s case file with the subject FW: ADA. Earlier that same day, at 1:22 PM, Robin sent to Bryce a message with the subject Fwd: ADA and a simple \u201cThank You!\u201d The forwarded content includes the September 26 and September 23 communications described above, as well as the September 22 message detailing the injury, the ADA seating concerns, and the reference 132712:2023007.

And for any exemptions kindly reach out to the festival info@louderthanlife.com.\u00a0If your event has been\u00a0canceled, postponed rescheduled, or moved to a new location, and refunds have been approved by the Event Provider, we will notify you by email, to the email address on file, with the refund or exchange procedures provided by the Event Provider.

I have a picture of the 6-7 inch drop off. I contacted you guys to see how I would go about getting into the concert for the remaining 3 days due to being in a wheel chair and crutches. Someone did respond to let me know that I would use their reply to get back into the concert if there were issues with security. I sent a reply to ask for the insurance contact but no one has responded. I even order my tickets as did my family for 2024 already this morning. So 6 people including me and my husband are coming in 2024 so it?s not like I?m hating on you guys for this happening. However there being no light or markings to warn that there was about a 6-7 inch drop off I fell due to it and now my ankle is broken. I need insurance contact information because my insurance is wanting me to get it. Attaching the pictures below.\n\nAttachment(s)IMG_9777.jpegIMG_8473.jpeg\n\ntrigger_logic_for_fgt\n\n[9PVL01-7E7KR]",
      "natural_language": "This case note concerns client Robin Willis Beck (Premise case date: 09-21-2023). On September 29, 2023, Robin contacted Front Gate Tickets about insurance information following an injury at the Louder Than Life festival. She reported breaking her ankle on the first night, attributing the injury to poor lighting and a hazard where grass gave way to concrete, describing a drop-off of six to seven inches. She stated there was no signage or lighting to warn of the drop-off and indicated hospital and medical bills as well as lost wages. Robin asserted she could prove the injury with pictures, paperwork, and witness statements, and she requested the contact information for the event\u2019s bodily-injury insurance (not ticket insurance). She provided her address (1214 Pigeon Pass Rd, Louisville, KY 40213) and phone number (502-260-2827) and noted that she had attached photos to her message (IMG_9777.jpeg and IMG_8473.jpeg). She also indicated intentions related to returning for the remaining days and to 2024 events, and she sought the appropriate insurance contact rather than a refund.\n\nFront Gate Tickets replied multiple times that there was no ticket insurance purchased or included with her order. In their replies, they advised Robin to refer to information about insurance and to contact the festival\u2019s general information for exemptions (festival info@louderthanlife.com). They also referenced the standard policy language: that all sales are final and that refunds or exchanges are typically prohibited by ticket-provider terms; exemptions could be pursued by contacting the festival information email. The responses came with timestamps on September 29, 2023, including 09:05 GMT+1 (Robin\u2019s initial inquiry about insurance), 17:58 GMT+1 (Dancel E\u2019s note that there was no ticket insurance), 18:06 GMT+1 (Robin\u2019s clarification that she was not seeking a refund and that she needed the event\u2019s insurance contact for bodily injury), 20:30 GMT+1 (Dancel E\u2019s reminder about no ticket insurance and the instruction to contact festival info@louderthanlife.com), and 22:20 GMT+1 (Robin reiterating that she needed the insurance contact and not ticket insurance). The final note from Front Gate Tickets on that day, 23:06 GMT+1, stated that the request for exemptions should go through the festival\u2019s own channels and again confirmed the absence of ticket insurance.\n\nIn addition to the above, the message thread included an instruction line within the forwarded thread: \u201cYour request (32542769) has been updated. To add additional comments, reply to this email,\u201d reflecting ongoing correspondence. The thread culminated with Robin sending a forward of the entire Insurance Info exchange to her attorney, Bryce Koon, on November 7, 2023 at 1:23 PM. In that forwarding, she included the prior chain, with the surrounding headers showing the outreach from Front Gate Tickets dated September 29, 2023, and the earlier responses. The forward\u2019s header shows the sending attorney contact: Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com) to RobinWillisBeckZ4295431@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, dated November 7, 2023 at 14:10:08 -0500. Robin\u2019s message to the attorney included a brief \u201cThank You!\u201d and indicated it was a forward of the insurance information.\n\nAttachments noted in the original thread were IMG_9777.jpeg and IMG_8473.jpeg. The record also includes the line \u201ctrigger_logic_for_fgt\u201d at the end of the capture. Overall, the notes document Robin\u2019s request for the insurance contact related to bodily injury from the Louder Than Life event, the vendor\u2019s confirmation that no ticket insurance existed and guidance to pursue festival-provided insurance information, her insistence that this is not a ticket-insurance issue, and the subsequent forwarding of the entire exchange to her attorney for potential legal consideration.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, and the Kentucky State Fair Board, et al., dated January 25, 2024, counsel for Robin Willis Beck exchanged emails about an extension of time to respond to the complaint. The matter arises from Beck\u2019s attendance at the Louder Than Life Festival promoted and presented by Danny Wimmer Presents. H&W Risk Management acts as the claims administrator for ACE American Insurance Company, the general liability insurer for the Kentucky State Fair Board (KSFB). This was the insurer\u2019s first notice of the incident, and, at that moment, no claim file had been set up nor a claim number issued. The insurer indicated that it would provide the claim number once the file was established and requested an extension of time to review the applicable contracts, consider a tender of defense, and refer the matter to defense counsel to respond to the Complaint. Kevin D. Prophet, MBA, AIC, Claims Supervisor for H&W Risk Management, wrote that he was attending to his father in hospice, which limited promptness in communications, but he could check email and schedule a call. He asked that the recipient confirm via email agreement to an extension of time to respond to the Complaint. Prophet provided his direct line (913-676-9284), email (kevin.prophet@hwins.com), and the address for H&W Risk Management (4300 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Fairway, KS 66205), along with the main line (913.432.4400) and the firm\u2019s website (www.hwins.com). He also noted that H&W Risk Management administers claims on behalf of ACE-American Insurance Company and included the relevant affiliations (Haas & Wilkerson; CA License numbers 0556737 and 4256968). The communication contained the standard disclaimer that insurance coverage or changes to coverage requested via text, voicemail, or email is not legally binding until confirmed by a licensed agent or employee, and that the transmission is confidential and privileged; dissemination to non\u2011intended recipients is prohibited.\n\nLater that day, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm replied that he was fine with a 14-day extension. The thread shows the exchange proceeding to an agreed extension of time to respond to the Complaint. The emails included the forwarded header from Bryce Koon at Whaley Law Firm, with the recipient address for Robin Willis Beck, and there were references to the ongoing settlement-defense coordination among the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the insurer\u2019s claims administrator. The correspondence also contains the Whaley Law Firm contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022, and the sender\u2019s signature.",

      "natural_language": "In the Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, et al. matter, labeled in the file as Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023, the client is Robin Willis Beck. The note concerns an extension to plead for all defendants, with communications in the case referencing the Jefferson Circuit Court civil claims brought by Beck. The email thread includes participants from Whaley Law Firm and Reminger Co., L.P.A., along with the Robin Willis Beck Filevine project email address.\n\nOn March 4, 2024, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., wrote Bryce Whaley at Whaley Law Firm (and cc\u2019d Aaron Whaley, Karen Hedgecock, and the Robin Willis Beck Filevine address) regarding an extension to plead for all defendants. Lowery explained that he had been retained to represent Danny Wimmer Presents in relation to Beck\u2019s civil claims in the Jefferson Circuit Court. He noted that co-defendant KSFB and its employees had submitted a defense tender demand onto DWP, and that DWP was currently evaluating it. He requested a global twenty-five day extension, moving the responsive pleading and/or motions deadline to Friday, March 29, 2024, to allow time to address the tenders and determine how to move forward with representations. He asked to be advised if the extension was agreeable or if there were questions or concerns, and expressed willingness to discuss the case further prior to tender outcomes.\n\nA follow-up message from Lowery was sent on March 7, 2024, at 9:04 AM. In that note, he addressed Bryce, asking whether the extension would be agreeable to Beck\u2019s client, noting that the extension offered to various adjusters was set to lapse the next day, and thus requesting consideration of the extension request.\n\nLater that same day, March 7, 2024, at 10:35:23 AM (-0500), Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm replied that Beck\u2019s client was agreeable to the extension. Whaley\u2019s message was sent to Steven Lowery with Bryce Whaley and Karen Hedgecock cc\u2019d, and included Robin Willis Beck\u2019s Filevine project email address. The reply was part of the same email thread discussing the extension of time to plead for all defendants in Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, et al. The message included standard firm contact details and a confidentiality disclaimer, consistent with the chain of correspondence on this matter.",

We appreciate your efforts in facilitating this process and are agreeable to the seven-day extension. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, we are agreeable to dismissal without prejudice of the government Defendants, with the understanding that the claims will be preserved, and the defendants may potentially be brought back into this litigation subject to discovery of new information.

As such, all defendants will be under the client umbrella of Reminger. Given this development, I would like to request one last good faith extension of seven days, until Friday April 5, 2024, to provide responses for the defendants to your clients complaint. Please let me know if this is agreeable and I thank you for your amenability to date regarding our responses to allow me to get the tender issue sorted out.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs to Kentucky State Fair Board, I want to make a formal request that it and its employees be released from the subject lawsuit. KSFB is a governmental entity enshrined in state statute, See KRS 247.100, et seq, and operates as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Mr. Hensler and Mr. McCoy are Executive members of the KSFB governmental staff, and their functions as outlined in your clients complaint are undisputably discretionary in nature. To the extent your client feels it has a separate and distinct claim of civil negligence against KSFB and its employees, she should proceed against those entities by filing a claim in the Board of Claims. Otherwise, governmental immunity and qualified official immunity will bar the claims against KSFB and its employees in the circuit court. As to voluntary dismissal, KSFB and its employees would be amenable to a dismissal without prejudice.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYour client\u2019s complaint facially alleges an injury sustained while a patron of Louder Than Life, hosted by Danny Wimmer Presents, and appears to allege that she sustained injury while within the portion of premises leased and controlled by Danny Wimmer. As such, DWP will be preparing an Answer to the Complaint and will be the primary party engaging in civil discovery with your client. \n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease review at your convenience the above requests and let me know if you have any questions or concerns that I may be able to address. Happy to jump on the phone and discuss these matters in more detail. Thank you both for your attention to these matters.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBest,\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 My Bio |\u00a0 \u00a0Website\u00a0 |\u00a0\u00a0vCard \n\nT? 502-625-7306F? 502-589-5436M 703-517-9480 www.reminger.com\n\nSteven B.

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, et al., Case: Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023, the client is Robin Willis Beck. On March 22, 2024, a series of emails was exchanged between counsel regarding the tender result, a request for a short extension, and the potential dismissal of the Kentucky State Fair Board (KSFB) defendants. Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., LPA, sent to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon (with Karen Hedgecock CC\u2019d) a message noting that Danny Wimmer Presents had accepted the defense tender for KSFB and its employees, meaning all defendants would be under the Reminger client umbrella. He requested a final good-faith extension of seven days, until Friday, April 5, 2024, to provide responses to the defendants\u2019 complaints, and asked for confirmation that this extension was agreeable. He also stated that he formally requested the release of KSFB and its employees from the subject lawsuit, explaining that KSFB is a governmental entity created by state statute (KRS 247.100, et seq.), operates as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and that Mr. Hensler and Mr. McCoy are executive members of KSFB\u2019s governmental staff. He argued that the functions described in the client\u2019s complaint are discretionary in nature and that, if the client has a separate and distinct civil negligence claim against KSFB and its employees, the proper route would be to file a claim with the Board of Claims; otherwise governmental immunity and qualified official immunity would bar those claims in circuit court. He indicated KSFB and its employees would be amenable to dismissal without prejudice. He also noted that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint facially alleges an injury sustained while a patron of Louder Than Life, the event hosted by Danny Wimmer Presents, and appears to allege injury within the portion of premises leased and controlled by Danny Wimmer; accordingly, DWP would be preparing an Answer to the Complaint and would be the primary party engaging in civil discovery with the client. He closed by inviting the recipients to review the requests and to discuss any questions by phone, thanking them for their attention.\n\nBryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied later that same day, acknowledging Steven\u2019s email and expressing agreement with the seven-day extension. He stated agreement to a dismissal without prejudice of the government Defendants, with the understanding that the claims would be preserved and that the defendants could potentially be brought back into the litigation subject to discovery of new information. However, Koon indicated a preference to receive an Answer on behalf of Danny Wimmer Presents prior to filing any Agreed Order of Dismissal. He concluded by thanking them for their attention and signing with his contact details for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-364-9363. The message emphasized confidentiality and included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, stating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient, may contain privileged information, and that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or forward the information. The notice also stated that the email had been scanned for viruses and malware by Mimecast Ltd.\n\nThe communications included the original email from Steven B. Lowery dated Friday, March 22, 2024 at 11:35 a.m., to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon with Karen Hedgecock CC\u2019d, and the subject line re Tender Result, Req for Extension and for KSFB Dismissal - Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, et al. Lowery\u2019s message outlined the tender acceptance by DWP, the need for an extension to respond to the complaint, and the request to release KSFB and its employees from the litigation, citing KSFB\u2019s statutory status and the immunity issues that would arise if it remained a party. It also described the expectation that Danny Wimmer Presents would file an Answer and would lead civil discovery in relation to the client\u2019s claims.\n\nIn addition to the substantive content, each email included standard confidentiality and privilege notices: The Whaley Law Firm email carried a confidential-attorney-client-privilege disclaimer, instructing that the message is intended only for the named recipient, that disclosure or use by others is prohibited, and that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or forward the information. The Reminger email carried a similar disclaimer about confidentiality and the virus-scanning status by Mimecast Ltd.\n\nIn summary, as of March 22, 2024, the parties contemplated that Danny Wimmer Presents would absorb the defense under Reminger\u2019s umbrella, sought a seven-day extension to respond to the complaint, and discussed the possible dismissal without prejudice of KSFB and its employees, with preservation of claims and the possibility of rejoining the litigation upon discovery. The parties also agreed\u2014subject to receiving Danny Wimmer Presents\u2019 Answer before any Agreed Order of Dismissal\u2014that such an approach would proceed, and they remained open to further discussion by phone if needed.",

      "natural_language": "On February 21, 2024, in the matter of extension request for Claim SF-USTT26089723 \u2014 Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC; KY State Fair Board; et al. \u2014 the client is Robin Willis Beck. The case involves Robin Willis Beck as the claimant, with the claim referenced as SF-USTT26089723 and captioned against Danny Wimmer Presents, LLC, the Kentucky State Fair Board, and others.\n\nThat same day, Devon Clark of Allianz Commercial sent an internal extension-request email to Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, Sarena Tuttle, Bryce Koon, and the Robin Willis Beck Filevine project address. The message was dated Wednesday, February 21, 2024 at 16:59:25 UTC. In the body, Clark expressed appreciation and stated that she was seeking an extension for counsel to respond because they are currently working to clear conflicts. She noted that the insured had forwarded the attached summons and complaint documents to her yesterday, and that those documents had been sent to an old address via certified mail and were received on February 5, 2024. Clark indicated she was working to assign defense on a rush assignment and observed that the effective due date for a response was Friday, February 23, 2024 (technically Sunday, February 25, 2024). She requested that the due date be extended to Friday, March 8, 2024, and asked for agreement or for another proposed date. The message included a cordial sign-off from Clark, with her pronouns listed as she/her/hers, and her contact information: direct line +1.302.553.1632, devon.clark@agcs.allianz.com, and links to Allianz\u2019s claims resources. The signature block also listed the Allianz group of affiliates and a broad disclaimer about Allianz\u2019s claims-promise and customer feedback.\n\nThe email thread shows an immediate response from Aaron Whaley, who replied on February 21, 2024 at 11:56 AM, \u201cI am fine with that.\u201d Earlier that same day, at approximately 11:53 AM, Clark had written to Aaron with the same extension request. In that earlier message, Clark reiterated the request for an extension for counsel to respond because the defense was being assigned on a rush basis, noting that the summons and complaint had been forwarded to her and were received on February 5, 2024 after being mailed to an old address. She again stated that the current due date for a response was Friday, February 23, 2024 (with the stated technical date of Sunday, February 25, 2024) and asked for a new due date of Friday, March 8, 2024, or another proposed date, pending agreement.\n\nThat message also included a confidentiality notice typical of Allianz communications: The information in the message and any accompanying files is confidential, may be legally privileged, and intended only for the named recipients; if received in error, the recipient should notify the sender and delete the material. The message footer identified the sender as Devon Clark of Allianz and included her professional title and firm information, along with Allianz\u2019s standard disclosures and disclaimers.\n\nThe chain ends with Aaron Whaley\u2019s brief reply agreeing to the proposed extension and with the standard signature block for Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022. The narrative also reflects the Filevine Project address listed among the To recipients: \u201cRobin Willis Beck SF 09/21/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address.\u201d The matter is documented in the Allianz communications as part of the claims handling process, with the parties coordinating a new response deadline in light of conflicts clearance and the recognition that summons and complaint documents were received at a non-current address.",

The same confidentiality disclaimer appeared in this message as well.\n\nSeparately, a forward from Aaron Whaley dated September 27, 2024 at 11:51:28 GMT-04:00 summarized the exchange. The forwarded email thread began with a message from Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., addressed to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Karen Hedgecock CC\u2019d. In Lowery\u2019s follow-up dated around 11:44 AM on September 27, 2024, he wrote: \u201cAaron and Bryce, Hope you\u2019re both well. Following up on the discovery requests we sent over 7/29/24, looks like we\u2019re about a month over time. When can we expect those?

Lowery of Reminger Co., L.P.A., and Karen Hedgecock, with accompanying confidentiality notices and standard contact information.",

Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., dated Friday, September 27, 2024, at approximately 11:44 AM, addressed to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Karen Hedgecock CC\u2019d. In that note, Lowery writes: \u201cAaron and Byrce, Hope you\u2019re both well. Following up on the discovery requests we sent over 7/29/24, looks like we\u2019re about a month over time.

The subject line of that email reads: \u201cre DWP Discovery to Ms. Beck - Beck, Robin v. Danny Wimmer Presents.\u201d In that July 29 message, Lowery states: \u201cAaron and Bryce, Hope all is well. Please find attached (1) DWP\u2019s IRFPDs onto Ms. Beck, with .WORD doc included, and (2) authorizations. If your client does not agree to authorizations for her medical and wage records, please let me know at your earliest convenience so we can begin the subpoena process. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.\u201d He signs with his professional details, including the firm\u2019s name, contact information, and a note about the attachments.\n\nThe thread includes Lowery\u2019s full contact information: Steven B.

His email signature also contains a confidentiality disclaimer stating that the information is confidential and intended only for the recipient or others authorized to receive it, that disclosure or action in relation to the contents is prohibited if one is not the intended recipient, and that the email has been scanned for viruses and malware by Mimecast. The forwarded message also notes the sender\u2019s affiliation with Reminger Co., L.P.A. and reiterates the recipient\u2019s contact at Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe chain also contains the second portion of the July 29 thread listing Aaron Whaley\u2019s and Bryce Koon\u2019s contact details as well as the Whaley Law Firm address (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222) and phone number (502-583-4022). The content of the July 29 message emphasizes that DWP\u2019s IRFPDs to Ms. Beck and the associated authorizations were attached, and that if Ms. Beck does not agree to authorizations for medical and wage records, they should be advised so the subpoena process can begin. The message ends with Lowery inviting any questions or concerns.\n\nIn summary, the communications show that discovery requests were sent on July 29, 2024, were reportedly about a month overdue by September 27, 2024, and that Lowery requested an estimate of when the discovery would be produced. He also offered to accept medical documentation related to Ms. Beck\u2019s treatment if additional time was needed. The attached materials referenced in the July 29 email included DWP\u2019s IRFPDs directed at Ms. Beck and medical/wage record authorizations. The correspondence also documents the procedural path toward potential subpoenas if the client did not authorize the release of medical and wage information.\n\nEnd of note.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023. The client is Robin Willis Beck, and the matter is Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (re discovery to Ms. Beck).\n\nThe correspondence unfolds as a chain of emails among counsel regarding DWP\u2019s discovery for Ms. Beck. On July 29, 2024, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., sent an email to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Karen Hedgecock copied, and with the Filevine address for Robin Willis Beck included in the CC. In that message, Lowery advised that attached to the email were (1) DWP\u2019s interrogatory and request for production disclosures onto Ms. Beck, provided in a Word document, and (2) authorizations. He noted that if Ms. Beck does not consent to authorizations for her medical and wage records, he asked to be informed at the earliest opportunity so the subpoena process could be initiated. He closed by inviting any questions or concerns and provided his contact information, including his direct line. The email also contained the standard attorney-client privileged disclaimer, indicating the message was confidential and that any inadvertent receipt should prompt contact with The Whaley Law Firm and caution against disclosure or forwarding.\n\nA subsequent message from Steven B. Lowery, dated September 27, 2024 at 11:45 AM, reaffirmed the status of the discovery requests\u2014those that were sent on July 29, 2024\u2014and noted that the requests were about a month past due. Lowery asked Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon when they could provide the expected responses and added that if additional time was required, they should send the medical documentation relating to Ms. Beck\u2019s treatment to assist in evaluating progress and needs. The message was copied to Karen Hedgecock, continuing the procedural reminder.\n\nEarlier in the timeline, on July 29, 2024, in the same thread, Lowery had stated that attached to his email were (1) DWP\u2019s IRFPDs onto Ms. Beck, with a Word document included, and (2) authorizations. He requested that if Ms. Beck did not agree to authorizations for her medical and wage records, the recipients should inform him as soon as possible so the subpoena process could begin. The communication concluded with an offer to answer questions or concerns and included Lowery\u2019s professional signature and affiliation with Reminger Co., L.P.A., along with the firm\u2019s address and contact information, and the standard disclaimer about confidentiality and restricted use.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, at approximately 1:55 PM GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent a response to counsel, including Aaron Whaley and Steven B. Lowery, with Karen Hedgecock and Robin Willis Beck\u2019s Filevine email address also in the correspondence. In this message, Bryce attached Plaintiff\u2019s discovery responses along with the associated notice filed that day. He provided a Dropbox link to the document production: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zq8y5cyunhcp989xz3fd8/AKakPDHt6bVwFBnN8RF0a_k?rlkey=9fev3zilbvkracbskcf6aq51u&st=tyuregsj&dl=0. Bryce stated that, as discussed, they would supplement these responses as updated medical records and expenses are received. The email included Bryce\u2019s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone number 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) and contained the confidentiality disclaimer conventional to such communications, noting the message was intended only for the named recipient and warning against use or disclosure by others, with instruction to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error.\n\nLater that same day, at approximately 7:06 AM, Steven B. Lowery replied to Aaron and Bryce, urging that the case be moved forward. He asked them to confirm whether they could provide the discovery responses within the next ten days. His email, like the others, was signed with his Reminger Co., L.P.A. affiliations and contact details and included the standard disclaimer about confidentiality and authorized recipients.",

Danny Wimmer Presents. The subject noted was the DWP discovery matter. In the body, Bryce attached Plaintiff\u2019s discovery responses along with the associated notice filed that day. He also provided a Dropbox link to the document production: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/zq8y5cyunhcp989xz3fd8/AKakPDHt6bVwFBnN8RF0a_k?rlkey=9fev3zilbvkracbskcf6aq51u&st=tyuregsj&dl=0. Bryce stated that the parties would supplement these responses as updated medical records and expenses are received. He welcomed any questions and signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq. of The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact information. A standard confidentiality disclaimer follow-up noted that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and instructed recipients who received it in error to contact The Whaley Law Firm and not to use or forward the information; the disclaimer also stated that no waiver of privilege applies.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 7:06 AM, Steven B. Lowery replied to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, expressing a desire to push the case along and asking to be advised if he could expect the discovery responses over the next ten days.\n\nThe thread also contains prior correspondence. On September 27, 2024, Steven B. Lowery sent a message to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Karen Hedgecock copied, in reply to a prior request titled RE: re DWP Discovery to Ms. Beck - Beck, Robin v. Danny Wimmer Presents. Lowery noted that the discovery requests had been sent on July 29, 2024 and that the matter was about a month overdue. He asked when the responses could be expected and added that if extra time was needed, it would help him if the medical documentation relating to Ms. Beck\u2019s treatment could be provided.\n\nEarlier still, on July 29, 2024 at 12:00 PM, Lowery wrote to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Karen Hedgecock copied, regarding re DWP Discovery to Ms. Beck. He attached DWP\u2019s IRFPDs onto Ms. Beck, including a Word document, and (2) authorizations. He stated that if the client did not agree to authorizations for medical and wage records, they should inform him at the earliest convenience so they could begin the subpoena process. He invited any questions or concerns. The signature block of this message included Lowery\u2019s Reminger contact details and a standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the information was confidential and intended only for the recipient, with a warning against disclosure or action by others, and that Mimecast had scanned the email for viruses.\n\nIn sum, the October 2024 communications documented the plaintiff\u2019s discovery responses and associated notices being shared, with a linked dropbox for production, and a continued intent to supplement as medical records and expenses were updated. They also show a back-and-forth timeline in which defense counsel pressed for timely responses and, when needed, for medical documentation to support any potential subpoena process.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents was proceeding in Jefferson Circuit Court (Jeff Cir Crt) under the caption Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, 24-CI-000532. The matter's client is Robin Willis Beck. On December 27, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm, through Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, sent an email to Steven B. Lowery at Reminger Co., L.P.A., with Karen Hedgecock also copied, and Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley CC\u2019d. The subject of that email was the case caption Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents - Jeff Cir Crt 24-CI-000532. In that message, Sarena expressed hopes that the recipients had enjoyed the holidays and stated that, as the New Year approached, they would like to move the claim forward and begin settlement discussions or proceed with oral discovery. She asked whether the office intended to depose Mrs. Willis Beck or if they were open to making an offer toward amicable settlement. She provided her contact information, noting her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and the address of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) along with telephone numbers: direct line (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104. The message also included a standard confidentiality disclaimer stating that the information is confidential, intended only for the recipient or others authorized to receive it, and that disclosure or action regarding the contents is prohibited if not the intended recipient. The email was sent from Sarena M. Tuttle with the subject listed above, and the firm\u2019s details noted the new email address.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, at approximately 12:01 PM, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., replied to Sarena (and to Karen Hedgecock, as indicated by the thread) after reviewing the file and the written discovery. In his response, he stated that, at that time, they would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition and requested that Sarena provide dates available for her in February. He also noted that if The Whaley Law Firm wished to provide a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and for evaluation of potential resolution. Lowery provided his direct contact number, 502-625-7306, and identified himself with Reminger Co., L.P.A.\n\nEarlier in the thread, also on January 2, 2025, at 12:08:26 PM -0500, Sarena sent another message to Mr. Lowery confirming that they would definitely send a Demand Package as soon as possible. She stated that, in the meantime, their office was available for deposition scheduling in February except for the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th. Her message included again her contact details, reiterating the new email address. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information appeared as: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a parenthetical note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the correspondence concerning Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson Circuit Court, 24-CI-000532) spanned December 27, 2024, through early January 2025. The parties discussed moving forward with discovery and/or settlement, with The Whaley Law Firm indicating readiness to send a settlement demand package and to depose Ms. Beck, and Reminger indicating a preference to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition while remaining open to evaluating any settlement demand. The latest exchange established February deposition availability (with specific dates to be provided) and reaffirmed the firm\u2019s plan to forward a Demand Package.",

The matter is identified in the file as a premises-case with the client, Robin Willis Beck.\n\nChronology of communications:\n\n- December 27, 2024: Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Steven B. Lowery and Karen Hedgecock (cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley) to express the intent to move the claim forward as the New Year begins.

The message included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and noted Sarena\u2019s new email address.\n\n- January 2, 2025, 12:01 p.m. (approximately): Steven B.

He stated that he had reviewed the file and the written discovery provided and informed them that, at this time, his side would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition.

He indicated he had reviewed the file and written discovery and reiterated that Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition should proceed. He asked for February dates for Ms. Beck and reminded that a settlement demand, if provided, would be forwarded to his client for consideration and possible resolution.\n\n- The same day, Steven also proposed a deposition time: Wednesday, February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m., and asked whether the deposition should take place at the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s offices or at his own office. He noted that his office is available at 730 W. Main by the Slugger Museum and stated that, if that arrangement worked, they would ensure the matter was noticed accordingly.\n\n- The chain also contains a banner/formatting marker (CGBANNERINDICATOR) and an image banner link included in the January 2, 2025 correspondence. In the body of the exchange, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s attorney information is reflected, including Sarena Tuttle\u2019s full title and contact details, with the firm\u2019s mailing address and phone numbers, and an explicit note about Sarena\u2019s new email address.\n\n- The record contains the following contact details and signatures: Sarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson Circuit Court (Jeff Cir Crt), 24-CI-000532. The client is Robin Willis Beck.\n\nBetween The Whaley Law Firm and Reminger Co., L.P.A., a series of email communications occurred from late December 2024 through January 2025 regarding settlement discussions, discovery, and the deposition of Mrs. Beck. The lead attorney for The Whaley Law Firm was Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager, who also provided her contact information and noted a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The recipient firm was Reminger Co., L.P.A., represented by Steven B. Lowery, Esq., with contact information 502-625-7306 (direct). The emails were sent to and cc\u2019d several individuals, including Karen Hedgecock, Bryce Koon, and Aaron Whaley for the Whaley firm.\n\nThe initial outreach occurred on December 27, 2024, when Sarena Tuttle emailed Mr. Lowery and Mrs. Hedgecock (with Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley CC\u2019d) to express the desire to move the claim forward as the new year began. She proposed beginning settlement discussions and/or moving forward with oral discovery, and asked for a determination on whether the defense intended to depose Mrs. Willis Beck or was open to making an offer toward amicable settlement. The communication included standard confidentiality disclaimers stating that the information was confidential and intended solely for the recipient, and noted that the email had been scanned for viruses and malware by Mimecast Ltd.\n\nOn January 2, 2025 at approximately 12:01 PM, Mr. Lowery replied. He indicated that, after reviewing the file and the written discovery, the defense would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition. He requested available dates in February and suggested that Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition could be produced at either the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office or his own office, noting that his office is located at 730 W. Main by the Slugger Museum and that they would arrange notice if that option was chosen. He also stated that if the Whaley firm wished to present a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and evaluation of a potential resolution.\n\nSarena Tuttle responded on the same day, January 2, 2025, at 12:08 PM, confirming that a Demand Package would be provided as soon as possible. She also stated that the Whaley firm was available most of February, with the exceptions of February 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th. Her signature block reiterated her role and contact information and again included the note about the new email address.\n\nShortly after, at approximately 12:11 PM, Mr. Lowery replied again, thanking her for the outreach and confirming that he had reviewed the file and the written discovery. He reiterated the desire to proceed with Mrs. Beck\u2019s deposition and again asked for February dates. He also reminded that if the office wished to provide a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and evaluation of potential resolution.\n\nLater that day, at 1:36 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent a final confirming message. She stated that February 19, 2025, at 1:00 PM would be perfect for the deposition, and that they could use Mr. Lowery\u2019s office for the deposition. She indicated she would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the Notice To Take Deposition (NTTD). The message concluded with her thanks.\n\nIn summary, the parties agreed to schedule Mrs. Beck\u2019s deposition for February 19, 2025, at 1:00 PM, with the option to hold the deposition at Mr. Lowery\u2019s office if that was convenient. The Whaley Law Firm planned to send a Demand Package and to issue a formal deposition notice to Mrs. Beck following receipt of the NTTD. The exchange also confirmed the parties\u2019 general preference for pursuing settlement discussions or discovery as appropriate, and identified the February availability window for the deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023. Client: Robin Willis Beck. This matter is Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, Jeff Cir Crt, 24-CI-000532.\n\nIn late December 2024, The Whaley Law Firm opened the dialogue by email. On December 27, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Steven B. Lowery and Karen Hedgecock, with Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley copied. She explained that, after the holiday season, the firm wished to move the claim forward and sought to begin settlement discussions and/or proceed with oral discovery. She asked for guidance on whether the defense intended to take the deposition of Mrs. Willis Beck or whether they were open to making an offer toward an amicable settlement. Her message provided her contact details, including the Whaley Law Firm address in Louisville, KY, and noted her new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with direct and office phone numbers.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, at 1:36 PM, Sarena Tuttle responded to Steven B. Lowery. She stated that February 19 at 1:00 PM was perfect and that they could use Lowery\u2019s office for the deposition. She indicated that she would send a formal Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the NTTD (Notice to Take Deposition). She also confirmed her intent to forward the formal notice to Mrs. Beck once the NTTD was in hand. The message was copied to Karen Hedgecock, Bryce Koon, and Aaron Whaley, and included Tuttle\u2019s signature and contact information.\n\nShortly after, on January 2, 2025 at 20:42:01 +0000, Karen Hedgecock of Reminger Co., L.P.A. sent a message noting that a Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck had been attached and that it had just been e-filed with the Court. Hedgecock provided her contact number (502-584-1310) and her affiliation with Reminger Co., L.P.A.\n\nIn the exchange that followed, Steven B. Lowery also weighed in on January 2, 2025, offering settlement flexibility. He wrote that, \u201cThat said, if your office wishes to provide a settlement demand, I will forward it to my client for consideration and for evaluation of potential resolution.\u201d He closed with his direct line, 502-625-7306, and his Reminger affiliation.\n\nSummary of the core developments: the case remains Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-000532. A Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck was filed with the Court, with an anticipated deposition date of February 19 at 1:00 PM to be conducted at the office of the receiving party (as referenced in the February 19 scheduling). The parties discussed both the possibility of proceeding with oral discovery and the potential for an amicable settlement, with a formal notice to Mrs. Beck to be issued following the receipt of the Notice to Take Deposition and the parties\u2019 coordination on scheduling.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, Jeff Cir Crt 24-CI-000532. Client: Robin Willis Beck.\n\nIn late December 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, acting as litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for Robin Willis Beck, reached out to Steven B. Lowery of Reminger Co., L.P.A. and Karen Hedgecock regarding the progress of the claim. She suggested that, as the New Year began, the parties explore settlement discussions and/or move forward with oral discovery, and she asked to be advised whether Reminger intended to take Mrs. Beck\u2019s deposition or if they would be open to an amicable settlement offer.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, communications continued to firm up the deposition schedule. At 12:01 p.m., Steven Lowery replied that he had reviewed the file and the written discovery and, at that time, preferred to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition. He asked what February dates would be available for her and noted that, if the office wished to provide a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and potential resolution. Later that same afternoon, at 12:08 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded that they were available for most of February, with exceptions on the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th, and she indicated they would send a Demand Package as soon as possible. At 12:11 p.m., Lowery followed up, confirming his intent to proceed with the deposition, requesting February dates for Ms. Beck, and noting that he could host the deposition at his office (at 730 W. Main by the Slugger Museum) or that the Whaley Law Firm could host it instead if preferred. He also mentioned that, if the opposing side wished to provide a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and evaluation of potential resolution.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 1:36 p.m., Sarena Tuttle replied that February 19th at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and that they could use Lowery\u2019s office. She stated she would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the Notice to Take Deposition (NTTD). Karen Hedgecock then informed the team, at 3:42 p.m., that a Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck had been attached and filed with the Court. In a follow-up message at 3:44 p.m., Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt and thanked Mrs. Hedgecock, including her contact details and noting Sarena\u2019s new email address.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 2, 2025, the team also coordinated the practical aspects of the deposition. The deposition notice was issued and the Court e-filed the Notice to Take Deposition of Robin Beck, as indicated by Hedgecock\u2019s attachment. The parties' email signatures included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s information, including Sarena Tuttle\u2019s new email address, and the Whaley team continued to confirm availability and scheduling details.\n\nFinally, on February 17, 2025, Steven Lowery sent a follow-up message noting a growing chance of significant winter weather on Wednesday and proposing that the deposition be conducted via Zoom rather than in person at his office, in order to account for the weather risk and avoid potential rescheduling. The proposed date referenced in the exchange was Wednesday, February 19, 2025, which would be the deposition date previously discussed as February 19 at 1:00 p.m. The message proposed proceeding by Zoom if the other side agreed, with the aim of avoiding delays caused by weather.\n\nIn summary, the case of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jeff Cir Crt 24-CI-000532) progressed from settlement discussions and a request to advance to oral discovery in late December 2024, to a formal plan for Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition on February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m., to the filing and notice of the deposition with the court, and, as February approached, consideration of conducting the deposition by Zoom due to anticipated winter weather. The Whaley Law Firm represented Robin Willis Beck, and Reminger Co., L.P.A. represented Danny Wimmer Presents. The deposition notice was filed with the court, and new contact details for Sarena Tuttle were communicated.",

      "natural_language": "The Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents matter, filed in Jeff Cir Court under case number 24-CI-000532, involves the client Robin Willis Beck. The file shows a sequence of discovery and settlement communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Reminger Co., L.P.A. representatives beginning in late December 2024 and continuing through February 2025, focused on whether to depose Ms. Beck and whether to pursue settlement.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, reached out to Steven B. Lowery of Reminger and Karen Hedgecock, with cc\u2019s to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley. In that message, she expressed a desire to move the claim forward as the year turned and asked whether the parties planned to Depose Mrs. Beck or to engage in amicable settlement discussions. She indicated that the firm was ready to begin oral discovery or settlement discussions and asked for guidance on whether the deposition would be pursued. The email included Tuttle\u2019s standard signature with her contact details at The Whaley Law Firm and noted her new email address, along with confidentiality disclaimers stating that the information was confidential and intended only for the recipient, as well as a warning that disclosure or action based on the contents could be unlawful; the Mimecast virus and malware scanning disclaimer was included as well.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Lowery replied that, after reviewing the file and the written discovery, his office would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition and asked what dates were available for February. He also offered that if a settlement demand package was provided, he would forward it to his client for consideration and for evaluation of potential resolution.\n\nSarena Tuttle responded later that same day, noting that they would definitely send a demand package as soon as possible and that, in the meantime, they were available for most of February except for the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th.\n\nLater that day, Tuttle replied again, confirming that February 19th at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and that they could use Lowery\u2019s office. She also stated that she would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the Notice to Take Deposition (NTTD).\n\nAlso on January 2, 2025, Karen Hedgecock informed that a Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck had been attached and filed with the Court.\n\nIn the same thread, Tuttle, in a subsequent message, again confirmed that February 19th at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and that they could use Lowery\u2019s office. She reiterated that she would send formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the NTTD and thanked Lowery.\n\nBy mid-February 2025, the weather outlook prompted reconsideration of the deposition format. On February 16, 2025, Lowery suggested conducting the deposition via Zoom to account for a growing chance of significant winter weather on the scheduled day, rather than holding it in person at his office, in order to avoid potential rescheduling.\n\nThe following day, February 17, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied that Mr. Koon was perfectly fine with proceeding by Zoom in anticipation of weather concerns. She added that if Lowery\u2019s office preferred, his court reporter could send over a Zoom link, and that they would update Mrs. Beck accordingly.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties referenced both deposition scheduling and the potential for settlement discussions, with the possibility of a settlement demand being forwarded for client consideration. The communications include the usual formalities and signatures from both sides, including Sarena Tuttle\u2019s and Steven B. Lowery\u2019s contact details and offices. In addition to the substantive content, the signature blocks reflect that Sarena\u2019s email address is noted as the new address, and the exchanges included the standard confidentiality disclosures and Mimecast virus-scanning notices found in multiple messages within the chain.",

      "natural_language": "In the Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents matter, pending in Jeff Cir Crt 24-CI-000532, the deposition of Robin Beck was first scheduled and discussed through a series of email exchanges between early January and mid-February 2025. The write-up shown here consolidates those communications into a flowing narrative while preserving all persons, dates, decisions, and logistical details.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., replied to discussions with The Whaley Law Firm regarding the deposition of Ms. Beck. He indicated that he had reviewed the file and the written discovery and stated that the parties would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition. He asked what dates in February would work for Ms. Beck and suggested Wednesday, February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. as a candidate time, noting that the deposition could be produced at the Whaley office or at his own office at 730 W. Main by the Slugger Museum if that arrangement was preferred. He also mentioned the possibility of a settlement demand and offered to forward any such demand to his client for consideration and evaluation of potential resolution. The contemporaneous message signaled that the deposition would be noticed, and he invited the Whaley team to provide dates and proceed with notice if acceptable.\n\nEarlier that same day, the Whaley firm responded with their availability: Mr. Bryce Koon was perfectly fine with scheduling in February given weather considerations, and they were available most of February except for the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th. Sarena M. Tuttle, the Whaley firm\u2019s Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, stated that if the defense wished to have their court reporter send a Zoom link, they would update Mrs. Beck accordingly. In addition, she confirmed they would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the other side\u2019s notice to take deposition (NTTD). Karen Hedgecock of Reminger later advised that a Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck had been attached and filed with the Court.\n\nLater on January 2, 2025, further exchanges solidified the agreed date and location. At 1:36 p.m., Sarena Tuttle wrote that February 19th at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and that they could use the defense\u2019s office, while also noting they would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the NTTD. Steven Lowery followed up at 12:11 p.m. with a practical question: would February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. work for the Beck deposition, and would she be produced at the Whaley office? He added that his own office remained available at the same time if that arrangement was preferred, and he stated that if the plan worked, the deposition would be noticed. He also reminded that the team would forward a settlement demand if the Whaley office chose to provide one for his client\u2019s consideration.\n\nIn the meantime, the Whaley firm provided their contact details and reaffirmed readiness to proceed, with Sarena listing the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and contact information (D: 502-357-9971, O: 502-583-4022 ext. 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; noting the new email address). The January 2 sequence also included Karen Hedgecock\u2019s note that the Notice to Take the Deposition had been attached and filed with the Court.\n\nAs the February 19 deposition date approached, the parties began to consider weather contingencies. On February 16, 2025, at 8:14 p.m., Steven B. Lowery sent a message to counsel noting a growing chance of significant winter weather on Wednesday and asking whether the deposition could be conducted via Zoom rather than in person at their office to account for the possibility and avoid potential rescheduling.\n\nThe weather concern prompted further confirmation the following day. On February 17, 2025, at 11:48 a.m., Sarena Tuttle affirmed that Mr. Bryce Koon was perfectly fine with this plan given the weather, and she offered that if the defense\u2019s court reporter should send over a Zoom link, they would update Mrs. Beck accordingly. Later that same day, at 4:51 p.m. (as reflected in the email timestamp), Steven Lowery replied that they would reach out to the court reporter to move the deposition to Zoom and to obtain a link, which would be forwarded to Mrs. Beck\u2019s office once received. In the same thread, Sarena reiterated that Mr. Koon was comfortable with proceeding via Zoom due to the anticipated weather and confirmed they would update Mrs. Beck with the Zoom link when available.\n\nIn summary, the depositions in this case were initially scheduled for February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m., with the option to conduct the deposition at one of the offices (the Whaley office or Lowery\u2019s) and, contingent on the weather and logistical considerations, to use Zoom. After the weather alerts issued by the National Weather Service for Louisville during the week of the deposition, the parties agreed to pivot to a Zoom deposition to avoid rescheduling, with the court reporter to provide a Zoom link to be forwarded to Mrs. Beck and the appropriate counsel once available. The communications also referenced a Demand Package and the possibility of a settlement demand for consideration, and a formal Notice to Take Deposition had been filed with the Court. The exchange documents the coordinated effort among Steven B. Lowery on behalf of Reminger and Sarena M. Tuttle, Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, and Karen Hedgecock of The Whaley Law Firm to schedule and adapt the deposition in light of weather concerns, while preserving the underlying case logistics and deadlines.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents \u2013 Jeff Cir Crt, 24-CI-000532, related to Robin Willis Beck. The correspondence centers on scheduling and coordinating the deposition of Mrs. Robin Beck in the matter, with the Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager) representing Mrs. Beck, and Reminger Co., L.P.A. representing the defense.\n\nIn late December 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm reached out to Steven B. Lowery and Karen Hedgecock to move the claim forward. She stated that they hoped everyone would be safe and asked whether the deposition of Mrs. Beck would proceed or whether settlement discussions would occur, inviting Reminger to advise their intention regarding deposition or settlement offers. She provided her contact information, including her new email address, and signed as Sarena M. Tuttle, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and direct lines (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104) and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Lowery responded that they had reviewed the file and wished to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition, requesting available February dates. He noted that if Whaley wished to provide a settlement demand, he would forward it to his client for consideration and potential resolution. Later that day, Sarena replied that Mrs. Beck\u2019s team was available for most of February, with the exceptions of the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th.\n\nLater on January 2, 2025, Lowery proposed a concrete date and time: Wednesday, February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m., suggesting production at Mrs. Beck\u2019s offices and noting that his office was open at 730 W. Main by the Slugger Museum if that location was more convenient. In response, Sarena confirmed that February 19 at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and offered to use Lowery\u2019s office; she also stated that she would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the Notice to Take the Deposition (NTTD). She closed with thanks and her signature and contact information, including the reminder to note her new email address.\n\nShortly afterward, on January 2, 2025, Karen Hedgecock sent an attached Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck, which had just been e-filed with the Court. Sarena acknowledged receipt of Hedgecock\u2019s message and indicated appreciation. The chain also included the standard disclaimers typical of exchange with opposing counsel, highlighting confidentiality and prohibition against disclosure or action by non-recipients; these disclaimers appeared in the January 2, 2025 communications and noted that the email had been scanned for viruses and malware by Mimecast Ltd.\n\nMoving into February 2025, the weather became a factor. On February 16, 2025, Steven Lowery warned that a significant winter storm appeared likely to impact Wednesday and proposed conducting the deposition via Zoom rather than in person at their office to avoid potential rescheduling. He indicated that he would forward a Zoom link if proceeding remotely. Sarena, responding later that day, stated that Mr. Koon was comfortable with this plan given the weather and offered to have the court reporter send a Zoom link, noting that they would update Mrs. Beck accordingly.\n\nThe following day, February 17, 2025, Lowery acknowledged the weather concerns and confirmed they would move to Zoom, stating that they would reach out to the court reporter to generate a Zoom link and forward it when available. Sarena replied, indicating that they understood and prioritized safety, that they had spoken with Mrs. Beck who was understanding, and that they looked forward to hearing back from Lowery. She signed off with her name, title, and firm contact details, including her new email address.\n\nIn sum, the deposit of Robin Beck in the case Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents was scheduled for February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m., to be conducted at a location to be determined (initially proposed at Reminger\u2019s office, with Whaley prepared to accommodate). After a Notice to Take Deposition was filed with the Court, and with rising winter weather prompting a shift to a Zoom format, the parties coordinated through mid-February 2025 to ensure the deposition could proceed safely and efficiently, updating Mrs. Beck as needed and maintaining communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Reminger.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court (Jeff Cir Crt), case number 24-CI-000532, the deposition of Robin Beck was scheduled for February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m. The Whaley Law Firm, representing Mrs. Beck, and Reminger Co., L.P.A., representing the defense, coordinated the deposition logistics. The initial plan, discussed in early January 2025, was to have the deposition produced on Wednesday, February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m., with production either at the Whaley office or at Steven B. Lowery\u2019s office (Lowery noted he was at an address beginning with 730 W. M, though the full street name was not shown in the message). Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm confirmed that February 19 at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and advised that she would send a formal Notice to Take the Deposition (NTTD) to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the defense\u2019s NTTD.\n\nOn January 2, 2025, Karen Hedgecock of Reminger transmitted the Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck, which had been e-filed with the Court, and Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt later that afternoon. Steven Lowery had proposed the date and expressed that his office could accommodate the deposition if needed. Sarena indicated that February 19 at 1:00 p.m. worked and that she would await the formal NTTD. The Whaley firm provided their contact details, and Sarena\u2019s communication reflected her then-current email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n\nBy February 16, 2025, Steven Lowery informed counsel that significant winter weather was increasingly likely for Tuesday night into Wednesday, and suggested conducting the deposition via Zoom instead of in person to avoid potential rescheduling. Sarena Tuttle replied on February 17, 2025, noting that Mr. Koon was agreeable to this change given the weather concerns, and offered that if Steven\u2019s court reporter should send a Zoom link, they would update Mrs. Beck accordingly. Steven responded that they would contact the court reporter to move the deposition to Zoom and would forward the link once available, inviting any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarena followed with further acknowledgment, stating that they understood the safety concerns and had spoken with Mrs. Beck, who was also understanding; she added that they would look forward to hearing back.\n\nThe weather-adjusted plan was finalized, and on February 18, 2025, Karen Hedgecock sent the Zoom deposition details. She wrote: \u201cGood Morning All, Here is the link for the Zoom deposition scheduled for tomorrow at 1pm. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks.\u201d She provided the complete Zoom meeting information:\n- Link: https://magnals.zoom.us/j/92499507129?pwd=BtuiZw7fK6FgXDyWEutaR8Tk4nvR4L.1\n- Meeting ID: 924 9950 7129\n- Password: 352870\n- One tap mobile: +16469313807,,92499507129# US (New York); 8558801246,,92499507129# US Toll-free\n- Dial by location: +1 646 931 3807 US (New York); 855 880 1246 US Toll-free\n- Meeting ID: 924 9950 7129; Password: 352870\n- Find your local number: https://magnals.zoom.us/u/ab6aT0vrxs\n\nKaren also included her contact details: Karen Hedgecock, 502-584-1310 (phone), Reminger Co., L.P.A. Her message followed the earlier communications from Sarena and Steven, which had discussed moving to Zoom and coordinating with the court reporter to ensure the deposition could proceed in light of the winter weather.\n\nThroughout the chain of communications, the participants included:\n- The Whaley Law Firm: Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager) and her team, with new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n- Reminger Co., L.P.A.: Karen Hedgecock (with the listed phone number 502-584-1310) and Steven B. Lowery, Esq. (direct line 502-625-7306) and Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley as CC recipients.\n- The case subject and participants included the deposition of Robin Willis Beck in the matter against Danny Wimmer Presents, with the deposition originally contemplated for in-person attendance at the Whaley office or the defense\u2019s option, but ultimately moved to Zoom due to weather concerns.\n\nIn summary, after initial scheduling discussions for February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m. and a notice to take the deposition filed with the Court, the plan shifted to a Zoom deposition in response to a winter weather watch. The defense and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel coordinated the Zoom logistics, and on February 18, 2025, the Zoom link and dial-in details were circulated for the deposition (now confirmed as taking place the following day at 1:00 p.m.).",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson Circuit Court, Case No. 24-CI-000532. The client is Robin Willis Beck.\n\nIn late 2024 and early 2025, counsel communications focused on scheduling Robin Beck\u2019s deposition in the above-referenced Jefferson Circuit Court case. The deposition was to be taken in February 2025. On December 27, 2024, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., wrote to Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm indicating that they would like to proceed with Ms. Beck\u2019s deposition and asking for dates available in February, and he noted that if a settlement demand would be forthcoming, he would forward it to his client for consideration. In response, on January 2, 2025, Sarena acknowledged the outreach and stated they would send a Demand Package as soon as possible, while noting that they were available for most of February except the 5th, 6th, 12th, and 18th.\n\nLater that same day, Steven suggested scheduling the deposition for Wednesday, February 19, 2025, at 1:00 p.m., asking whether the deposition could be produced at Beck\u2019s offices or at his own office (he noted his office is at 730 W. Main, near the Slugger Museum). Sarena replied that February 19 at 1:00 p.m. was perfect and that they could use the opposing party\u2019s office; she also said she would send a formal notice to Mrs. Beck upon receipt of the Notice to Take the Deposition (NTTD). Karen Hedgecock, with Reminger Co., L.P.A., followed up by attaching a Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck, which had just been e-filed with the Court.\n\nSubsequently, the deposition date remained set for February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m., with the plan to hold it at the offices of the counsel unless otherwise arranged. The parties continued to discuss logistical details, including the possibility of a settlement demand, and they agreed to move forward with the deposition as schedule permitted.\n\nAs the date approached, concerns about winter weather emerged. On February 16, 2025, Steven B. Lowery proposed conducting the deposition via Zoom instead of in person at their office in order to guard against weather-related disruptions. On February 17, 2025, Sarena Tuttle responded that Mr. Koon was comfortable with this plan in light of the weather, and she offered to have their court reporter issue a Zoom link and to update Mrs. Beck accordingly. Later that day, Steven acknowledged the weather concerns and reiterated the prudent move to Zoom, and he indicated that he would forward a Zoom link once arranged.\n\nBy February 18, 2025, the Zoom arrangement was in place. At 9:33 a.m. that day, Sarena Tuttle sent Karen Hedgecock an email with the Zoom deposition link for the deposition scheduled for the following day at 1:00 p.m., and she asked to be advised if there were any questions. Karen Hedgecock provided the Zoom access details in turn, including:\n\n- Link to join: https://magnals.zoom.us/j/92499507129?pwd=BtuiZw7fK6FgXDyWEutaR8Tk4nvR4L.1\n- Meeting ID: 924 9950 7129\n- Password: 352870\n- One-tap mobile: +16469313807,,92499507129# US (New York)\n- Toll-free: 855-880-1246,,92499507129# US\n- Dial by location: +1 646 931 3807 US (New York); Toll-free: 855-880-1246 US\n- Find your local number: https://magnals.zoom.us/u/ab6aT0vrxs\n- The message also lists Karen Hedgecock\u2019s contact information: 502-584-1310 (phone), Reminger Co., L.P.A.\n\nThe message thread in the emails shows ongoing coordination among the following individuals and their roles:\n\n- Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note the new email address).\n- Steven B. Lowery, Esq., Reminger Co., L.P.A. (direct line listed as 502-625-7306).\n- Karen Hedgecock, Reminger Co., L.P.A. (phone 502-584-1310).\n- Bryce Koon (whaley law firm), Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), and others were copied on various messages.\n\nTimeline highlights from the communications include:\n- December 27, 2024: Steven Lowery expressed a desire to proceed with Beck\u2019s deposition and asked for February dates.\n- January 2, 2025 (about 12:01 p.m.; 12:08 p.m.; 12:11 p.m.; and 1:36 p.m. exchanges): The parties discussed scheduling, availability (Beck\u2019s availability mostly in February except 5th, 6th, 12th, 18th), and tentatively scheduled February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m. for Beck\u2019s deposition, noting the option to place it at either party\u2019s office.\n- January 2, 2025 (3:42 p.m.): Karen Hedgecock attached the Notice to Take the Deposition of Robin Beck, which had been filed with the Court.\n- February 16\u201317, 2025: Weather concerns prompted consideration of Zoom deposition; the parties agreed to proceed by Zoom to avoid rescheduling due to winter storms.\n- February 18, 2025 (9:33 a.m. and onward): A Zoom link and access details were circulated for the deposition scheduled for February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m., with Karen Hedgecock and Sarena Tuttle coordinating the access and communication.\n\nIn sum, the deposition of Robin Beck in the matter Robin Willis Beck v Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson Circuit Court Case No. 24-CI-000532, was initially set for February 19, 2025 at 1:00 p.m. to be conducted at an office location (Beck\u2019s or counsel\u2019s), with a Notice to Take the Deposition filed. Due to anticipated winter weather, the parties agreed to conduct the deposition via Zoom, and a Zoom meeting was arranged with the meeting details circulated to all counsel and the court reporter. This coordination involved multiple parties, including The Whaley Law Firm and Reminger Co., L.P.A., and included notification of a new email address for Sarena M. Tuttle. All the above details are reflected in the email thread dated December 27, 2024, through February 18\u201319, 2025.",

Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson County case number 24-CI-000532.\n\nThe notes memorialize two email exchanges in March 2025 involving counsel for Robin Willis Beck. The first communication is dated March 11, 2025, when W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to opposing counsel inquiring whether the client would be interested in pursuing informal settlement negotiations before litigation progresses further and costs increase. The message was signed by Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and contact numbers: phone 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. The email header identifies Bryce Koon as the sender; the recipient was counsel, with no explicit recipient name listed in the note. The electronic message included a standard attorney-client privileged or protected information disclaimer, stating that it is intended only for the named recipient and that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledge no waiver of privilege, and refrain from using or forwarding the information to anyone not intended to receive it.\n\nThe second communication is dated Tuesday, March 18, 2025, at 10:48:38 AM (GMT-04:00). In this follow-up, Bryce Koon again addressed counsel regarding the same matter. The email\u2019s subject line was: Re: Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532). The message opened with \u201cGood afternoon counsel\u201d and stated, \u201cJust wanted to follow back up on this. Thanks.\u201d The message was sent from Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, to Steven Lowery of Reminger, with Steven Lowery\u2019s email address listed as SLowery@reminger.com. The CC line included Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) and the Robin Willis Beck Filevine project email address: RobinWillisBeckZ4295431@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The signature block again provided Bryce Koon\u2019s full contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207.

      "natural_language": "In the Robin Willis Beck case, identified as 20231026-000089, the parties exchanged a series of communications between The Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group from October 2024 through March 2025. The Whaley Law Firm was represented by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and The Phia Group\u2019s contact was Whitney McClure, a Senior Claim Recovery Specialist. The case file is titled Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023, and the client is Robin Willis Beck. The emails include standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of attorney-client communications, and several messages reference a Filevine project email address connected to Robin Willis Beck.\n\nOn October 16, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Whitney McClure with the subject Robin Willis Beck (20231026-000089). In that message, he stated \u201cPlease see attached,\u201d and the email carried the usual confidentiality disclaimer. The subject line also included an automated line that read, \u201cYou don\u2019t often get email from bryce@whaleylawfirm.com. Learn why this is important.\u201d The Whaley Law Firm signature block followed, listing Bryce Koon\u2019s contact details and firm address in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe following day, October 17, 2024, Whitney McClure replied with a brief acknowledgment: \u201cReceived. Thank you.\u201d Her message included her signature block identifying her as a Senior Claim Recovery Specialist for The Phia Group, along with the reminder that payments should be mailed to P.O. Box 499, Canton, MA 02021 and should include the case number. The confidentiality disclaimer appeared at the end of her message as well.\n\nEarlier correspondence included additional context in that period: on October 16, 2024, Bryce\u2019s email to Whitney carried the standard disclaimer about privilege and proper handling of the information.\n\nOn January 20, 2025, Bryce Koon again wrote to Whitney, requesting: \u201cPlease provide me with an updated itemized lien statement at your earliest convenience.\u201d Whitney did not reply in that message, but she did respond a day later with an itemization update.\n\nOn January 21, 2025, Whitney McClure replied, informing Bryce that \u201cItemization is attached,\u201d and providing her contact details again, including the Phia Group\u2019s phone and fax numbers and the same payment mailing instructions. The chain again included the usual confidentiality notices.\n\nIn a March 2025 sequence, Bryce sent a message on March 24, 2025 stating that they had finally received records for an August 17, 2024 Heartland Imaging visit, which were listed at the bottom of the ledger. He clarified that this imaging was for the right elbow and was not related to their claim, adding that they had not made any claim regarding the upper extremities.\n\nOn March 25, 2025, Bryce\u2019s message carried the formal subject line Re: Robin Willis Beck (20231026-000089) and was addressed to Whitney with a cc to Robin Willis Beck\u2019s Filevine project email address. The body began with \u201cReceived. Thank you.\u201d, and Bryce\u2019s signature followed. The chain also included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThat same day, Whitney McClure replied to the thread with a decla\u00ad\u00adration that \u201cI have removed the claim.\u201d Her message, like the others, included her contact information for The Phia Group and reiterated the payment mailing instructions, along with the familiar confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nIn summary, the key facts documented across these communications are: the case identifier 20231026-000089; the parties involved (The Whaley Law Firm and The Phia Group, with Bryce Koon and Whitney McClure as primary contacts); the October 2024 exchange acknowledging attachments; the January 2025 requests for and provision of an updated itemized lien statement; the March 2025 note that an August 17, 2024 Heartland Imaging visit (right elbow imaging) had been documented and deemed unrelated to the claim; and ultimately, on March 25, 2025, the claim was removed. The communications consistently carried standard confidentiality and privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson County case number 24-CI-000532, the client is Robin Willis Beck. This note documents a sequence of communications between The Whaley Law Firm and opposing counsel regarding settlement negotiations for Ms. Beck. The case caption and file references indicate the matter began under the heading Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023, with the formal caption \u201cRobin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532).\u201d\n\nOn April 14, 2025, at approximately 1:31 PM, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to the counsel for the other side after review and careful consideration. He stated that they were prepared to demand $50,000 for a full settlement of Ms. Beck\u2019s claim, inclusive of any liens. His signature block identified him as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number (502) 365-5043 and fax number (502) 237-3207. The email also carried a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledging that no waiver of privilege applies and that the information should not be used or forwarded to others not intended to receive it. The disclaimer appeared in the body of the message.\n\nThe chain continued with a follow-up email dated May 1, 2025, at 16:09:04 (4:09 PM) Eastern Time from Bryce Koon to Steven Lowery at Reminger & Reminger\u2019s address, with two CCs: Robin Willis Beck\u2019s SF 09/21/2023 Filevine Project Email Address and Sarena Tuttle. The subject line referenced the same matter: Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532). In the May 1 message, Koon wrote: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just following up on this. Any update appreciated.\u201d The May 1 email carried the same standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer as the April 14 message, reiterating that the communication is for the named recipient only and should not be disclosed or used if received in error.\n\nTogether, these communications document the case status: as of mid-April 2025, the firm indicated a willingness to demand $50,000 to settle Ms. Beck\u2019s claim in full, including lien considerations; and by early May 2025, counsel was follow\u00ading up for any update on the matter, with the May 1 message noting the ongoing inquiry and including the designated recipients and CCs.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the email communications in the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson County case number 24-CI-000532, with client Robin Willis Beck. The case caption appears as Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023. The primary participants in the correspondence are W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm representing Ms. Beck, and Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A. representing Danny Wimmer Presents (DWP). The subject line in the exchanges reads: \u201cRobin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532).\u201d The messages were sent between April and May 2025 and included a non-identifying CC to Robin Willis Beck\u2019s Filevine project email address, along with standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimers in each message. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address and contact information were listed in Bryce Koon\u2019s signature, and Reminger\u2019s contact details appeared in Steven Lowery\u2019s signature.\n\nOn April 14, 2025, Bryce Koon wrote to counsel for the defense after review and careful consideration. He stated that The Whaley Law Firm was prepared to demand fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) for full settlement of Ms. Beck\u2019s claim, including the payment of any liens. He thanked the recipient for their consideration and signaled a desire to move the case forward. This message included a disclaimer noting confidentiality and attorney-client privilege, as did the subsequent messages.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, at 4:09 PM, Bryce Koon followed up with counsel, asking for any update on the matter. He again included the standard disclaimer and his contact information.\n\nOn May 12, 2025, at 9:59 AM, Bryce Koon sent another message addressing the ongoing status of the demand. He stated that he had not heard back regarding the demand, which he believed to be reasonable and fairly conservative under the circumstances. He indicated openness to scheduling mediation if that was the preferred route, but he emphasized the need to move the case forward and noted that, if mediation were to occur, discovery responses from Ms. Beck would be required beforehand. He asked how counsel wished to proceed. The message carried the same confidentiality disclaimer and the affected contact details.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, at 9:42 AM (noted as \u201c9:42?AM\u201d in the record), Steven B. Lowery replied. He thanked Bryce for the follow-up and acknowledged his position regarding mediation if that route were pursued. He explained that the demand had been sent and was currently under discussion, adding that the insurance representative had been on vacation and that DWP was in festival season, making it difficult to set calls. He anticipated providing a response in the coming days. This reply also included the standard privilege disclaimer and Steven Lowery\u2019s signature.\n\nFinally, on May 23, 2025, at 10:29:44 AM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon sent a further follow-up: \u201cGood morning Steven, Any updates?\u201d He again included the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer and his firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nIn summary, these communications show an initial settlement demand of $50,000 for Ms. Beck\u2019s full settlement including liens on April 14, 2025, followed by repeated follow-ups through May 23, 2025. The defense indicated the demand had been sent and was under discussion, with scheduling delays attributed to an on-vacation insurance representative and DWP\u2019s festival season, and a note that mediation would require discovery responses beforehand if pursued.",

The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details were listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a brief follow-up message to counsel, stating: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Just following up on this. Any update appreciated.\u201d The email again included the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn May 12, 2025, Bryce Koon sent a more substantive note to counsel. He said: \u201cGood morning counsel, I haven\u2019t heard back regarding our demand, which I believe to be both reasonable and fairly conservative under the circumstances. While I\u2019m open to scheduling a mediation if that\u2019s the direction you prefer, we do need to move the case forward. If we are going to mediate, I\u2019ll need to get discovery responses from your client beforehand. Please let me know how you\u2019d like to proceed.\u201d This message carried the same confidentiality notice and the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details as before.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., replied: \u201cBryce, Thanks for the follow-up and understood re your position if mediation is requested. The demand has been sent over and is currently under discussion (the insurance rep was on vacation and DWP is in festival season so getting calls set has been complicated). Should have a response for you in the coming days.\u201d The closing signature included Lowery\u2019s direct phone line, 502-625-7306, and reiterated the Reminger firm details. The message also contained the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn May 23, 2025, Bryce Koon asked: \u201cGood morning Steven, Any updates?\u201d This message, like the others, included the standard confidentiality disclaimer and the Whaley Law Firm contact information.\n\nOn May 29, 2025, Steven B. Lowery responded: \u201cBryce, No update yet \u2013 I\u2019ve followed up this morning.\u201d The communication again carried the confidentiality disclaimer and Lowery\u2019s contact details.\n\nOn June 10, 2025, Bryce Koon sent another follow-up question, asking for an update, consistent with the ongoing discussion about the case\u2019s status and potential mediation or discovery issues. The message included the usual disclaimer and contact information.\n\nFinally, on June 12, 2025, at 9:57:46 a.m. Eastern Time (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon sent the most recent inquiry. He asked for dates for the deposition of the client\u2019s corporate representative in September and noted that written discovery would be served in the coming days. This message also included the standard confidentiality disclaimer and the parties\u2019 contact details again. The June 12 communication was CC\u2019d to Robin Willis Beck via her Filevine project email address, RobinWillisBeckZ4295431@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and explicitly referenced the ongoing scheduling need for the deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023. Client: Robin Willis Beck. This is the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson 24-CI-000532, and the communication thread concerns an offer to settle and related discovery.\n\nIn the latest exchange, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm addressed counsel for Danny Wimmer Presents. On June 30, 2025, he thanked Steven B. Lowery for the prior letter and screenshots, and stated that after reviewing the materials his client respectfully disagrees with the characterization of the conditions of the area in question. Despite that disagreement, to move the matter forward, he indicated that his client was willing to decrease the settlement demand to forty-five thousand dollars ($45,000). He also noted that attached to the message were discovery requests directed to DWP, and invited any questions about those requests. The email concluded with Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information and a standard confidentiality notice stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney\u2011client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or use the information.\n\nThe email trail shows a broader back-and-forth dating back to May and June 2025. In a June 25, 2025 message, Steven B. Lowery replied that Bryce\u2019s message and attachments served as a response to the parties\u2019 standing demand from April, and that he looked forward to hearing from Bryce and finishing the week well. Lowery also advised that he would be out of the office on vacation the following week, and that any response submitted during his absence would be addressed in the week of July 7.\n\nEarlier in the sequence, on June 19, 2025, Lowery wrote that the \u201cball is in my court\u201d but that he had been in mediations or depositions all week, and that he would provide a formal response by the end of the day (EOD) Monday, since he had to be in Cleveland the following day.\n\nOn June 12, 2025, there were two messages from Lowery. At 10:13 AM, he advised that the other side\u2019s \u201cball is in my court,\u201d but noted his team would need dates so that they could designate 30.02 representatives, and that he had heard back from his folks and would have a formal response to the client\u2019s demand early next week. Earlier that same day, Bryce Koon replied (9:57:46 AM) requesting dates for the deposition of the opposing party\u2019s corporate representative in September and indicating that written discovery would be served in the coming days. Bryce also included continued contact details and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nBefore that, on June 10, 2025 at 3:55 PM, Bryce asked if there was any update on the matter. He again provided his contact information and the confidentiality notice.\n\nLooking further back, a May 29, 2025 message from Steven Lowery stated there was no update yet, though he had followed up that morning. Bryce had earlier asked for updates on May 23, 2025, at 10:30 AM. In that exchange, Steven and Bryce were coordinating potential mediation and discussing a standing demand; Bryce suggested mediation could be scheduled if that was the preferred route and emphasized the need to obtain discovery responses beforehand if mediation was pursued.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Steven Lowery acknowledged Bryce\u2019s follow-up and indicated that the demand had been sent and was under discussion, noting that the insurance representative was on vacation and DWP was in festival season, which had made scheduling calls difficult. He anticipated a response in the coming days.\n\nEarlier still, on May 12, 2025, Bryce had asked for dates for the deposition of the client\u2019s corporate representative in September and stated that written discovery would be served in the coming days. A companion message from Bryce at 9:57 AM reiterated the request for deposition dates and the anticipated discovery.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, counsel corresponded regarding settlement posture, upcoming depositions, the designation of corporate representatives (including the need for dates and topics to designate 30.02 reps), and the timing of formal responses to settlement demands. The communications reference the case file for Robin Willis Beck SF 09/21/2023 (Filevine project address: RobinWillisBeckZ4295431@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), and reference the parties\u2019 ongoing efforts to resolve the matter with discovery and mediation as possible pathways.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532), the case notes show a sequence of settlement discussions and discovery planning conducted in mid-2025. The client is Robin Willis Beck. The communications occurred between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., with distribution to a Robin Beck Filevine project address. The subject line for the exchange is \u201cOffer to Settle,\u201d and the file is identified as Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023.\n\nThe first dated item in this thread is a July 22, 2025 email from Bryce Koon to Steven Lowery. In that message, Bryce follows up on potential deposition dates for Beck\u2019s case and outlines the anticipated deposition topics. He states that the deposition would cover topics identified in the discovery requests, including control and maintenance of the property, any inspections or upkeep performed, the presence or absence of signage or warnings, and Danny Wimmer Presents\u2019 general safety policies for the premises. He also notes that the deposition would address whether any steps were taken to evaluate or document the condition of the premises before or after the incident, and that once a date is confirmed, he would send a formal notice. The message includes Bryce\u2019s firm contact details and a standard confidentiality notice.\n\nEarlier correspondence in the thread shows the ongoing back-and-forth about settlement and discovery. On June 30, 2025, Steven Lowery replied to Bryce\u2019s prior message, thanking him and indicating that he would inform his team and begin written discovery. Lowery added that he would be out of the office that week but would reach out if there was a counteroffer the following week. In the June 30, 2025 exchange, Bryce had sent a message with the subject line \u201cRe: Offer to Settle,\u201d attaching discovery requests directed to Danny Wimmer Presents. In that message, Bryce stated that after reviewing the materials, his side respectfully disagreed with how the conditions of the relevant area were characterized by the opposing side, but in the interest of moving things forward, they were willing to reduce their settlement demand to $45,000. He also noted that discovery requests were attached and asked Lowery to contact him with any questions. The confidentiality disclaimer appears in this and related messages.\n\nPrior to that, on June 25, 2025, Steven Lowery sent a reply regarding settlement. He referenced a letter that provided a response to Beck\u2019s standing demand from April and expressed a willingness to hear back and complete the matter. Lowery also reminded that he would be out of the office the following week, so any responses submitted during that time would be answered in the week of July 7. This message also carried the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nIn earlier messages, Steven Lowery indicated that the \u201cball is in my court\u201d and that he would provide a response by the end of the day Monday, noting that he had to be in Cleveland the next day. He also indicated that his team would prepare dates for Beck\u2019s deposition and that the parties would designate the corporate representative (with a September target) and that written discovery would be served in the coming days. He mentioned needing topics to designate for the corporate representative and suggested that they would have a formal response to Beck\u2019s client\u2019s demand early the following week. Lowery reiterated these points in subsequent messages, including an exchange on June 12, 2025 and a follow-up on June 19, 2025, where he again referenced continuing discussions about dates and topics and noted he would respond by the end of the day due to travel obligations.\n\nEarlier still, on June 12, 2025, Bryce asked for deposition dates for Beck\u2019s corporate representative in September and indicated that written discovery would be served in the coming days. Lowery responded that he had heard back from his side and would have a formal response early the following week, and he mentioned needing topics so that his side could designate 30.02 reps. In his prior message from June 12, Bryce requested dates for the corporate representative\u2019s deposition in September and provided that written discovery would soon be served.\n\nThe thread also shows multiple confirmations of receipt and forwarding with the standard attorney-client confidentiality notices. The CC lines in the emails reflect distribution to Robin Willis Beck via the Filevine project address and reference the case file in the Filevine system. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information is listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-365-5043 and fax 502-237-3207. The Reminger firm\u2019s direct line for Steven Lowery is 502-625-7306.\n\nIn summary, through May to July 2025, counsel discussed scheduling for Beck\u2019s deposition, the topics to be covered (including property control and maintenance, inspections, warnings/signage, safety policies, and pre- and post-incident condition documentation), and ongoing settlement discussions. The parties exchanged offers and counteroffers, with the plaintiff\u2019s side reducing their demand to $45,000 and with written discovery being prepared and served, while deposition planning and corporate representative topics continued to be coordinated. Bryce\u2019s latest update in July 2025 confirms that he is awaiting dates for Beck\u2019s deposition and that a formal notice would follow once dates are confirmed.",

      "natural_language": "This is a descriptive narrative of the settlement and discovery discussions in the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson 24-CI-000532), with the case file labeled Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023 and the client Robin Willis Beck. The communications, exchanged by email between counsel for the plaintiff and defense, trace a sequence from mid-June through late July 2025, covering written discovery, deposition planning, and a proposed confidential settlement.\n\nThe thread begins with Steven B. Lowery of Reminger Co., L.P.A., indicating in mid-June 2025 that the \u201cball is in my court\u201d but that he had been in mediations or depositions all week and would provide a response by the end of the day Monday, as he would be in Cleveland the following day. On June 12, 2025, he also noted that while they would get some dates, they needed topics so that they could designate a 30(b)(2) or 30.02 representative, and he had heard back from his people that a formal response to the client\u2019s demand would be provided early the following week. By June 19, 2025, Lowery reiterated that he would respond by EOD Monday and acknowledged other commitments, including travel to Cleveland. On June 25, 2025, he posted that the parties\u2019 letter regarding settlement and related enclosures served as a response to the standing demand from April, and he warned that he would be out of the office the following week, with any responses submitted during that time to be addressed in the week of July 7.\n\nTwo days later, on June 30, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Lowery. He acknowledged receipt of Lowery\u2019s letter and screenshots, stated that they disagreed with the defense\u2019s characterization of the area conditions, and, in the interest of moving forward, offered to reduce their demand to $45,000 for settlement. Koon also attached discovery requests to DWP and invited questions. In the same day, Lowery responded that he would let his folks know and that they would begin work on written discovery, adding that he was out that week and would reach out if there was a counteroffer the next week.\n\nEarlier that same day, Bryce Koon had asked for depositions planning, noting that the topics would include those identified in the discovery requests, such as control and maintenance of the property, any inspections or upkeep performed, the presence or absence of signage or warnings, and DWP\u2019s general safety policies on the premises. He indicated that the parties would cover whether any steps had been taken to evaluate or document the condition of the premises before or after the incident, and he committed to sending a formal notice with dates once he received a date back from defense counsel.\n\nOn July 22, 2025, Bryce sent a follow-up to Steven Lowery regarding potential deposition dates for the plaintiff. He reiterated that the deposition topics would align with the discovery requests, specifically referencing control and maintenance of the property, inspections or upkeep, signage or warnings, and DWP\u2019s safety policies on the premises, as well as whether steps were taken to evaluate or document the premises\u2019 condition before or after the incident. He stated that once a date was received, he would issue a formal notice.\n\nA key turning point came on July 29, 2025. In the morning, Lowery requested an extension of about two weeks, until August 15, 2025, to provide full written discovery responses, noting that the discovery was presently due \"tomorrow.\" He also sought confirmation that they could designate a corporate representative for the 30(b)(6) deposition and requested Bryce to send a draft notice that would include the formal list of topics, so that designations and firm dates could be finalized, allowing Bryce to finalize the notice and file accordingly. Lowery also indicated that he had authority for one more increase in their settlement offer, proposing $15,000 inclusive of any liens for a full confidential settlement of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, and urged Bryce to take this offer back to his client for consideration. He invited any questions or concerns about these points.\n\nThat same day, Bryce Koon responded, agreeing to the extension to August 15 for the defense\u2019s responses. He said he would prepare and send a draft notice with topics and suggested that dates could then be set. He also thanked Lowery for the offer and said he would discuss it with his client and get back to him.\n\nThe email chain also includes the standard confidentiality and attorney-client privilege notices typical of each message, indicating that the communications are intended only for the named recipients and that the content may be privileged or protected; recipients who received the messages in error were instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and to refrain from sharing the information with others.\n\nIn summary, between June 12 and July 29, 2025, counsel engaged in a back-and-forth about discovery scheduling and responses, the designation and timing of a corporate representative for a 30(b)(6) deposition, the scope of deposition topics tied to the underlying discovery requests, and a tentative settlement position, with a pending extension to August 15, 2025 for discovery responses and a $15,000 settlement offer inclusive of liens proposed by defense counsel. The parties\u2019 counsel and the plaintiff Robin Willis Beck\u2019s file were repeatedly copied on these communications, which were conducted in the context of the Jefferson County case 24-CI-000532. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville office and contact information appear in the correspondences, and the defense counsel\u2019s Reminger Co., L.P.A. contact details are likewise reflected.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents, Jefferson County, 24-CI-000532, regarding premises liability claims brought by Robin Willis Beck. The client is Robin Willis Beck. The file notes concern the matter as it existed on July 29, 2025, and reflect a sequence of communications between counsel about discovery, depositions, and a possible settlement.\n\nThe timeline begins with an email chain dated June 25, 2025, in which Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., informed Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, that he had attached a letter regarding settlement and related enclosures in response to a standing settlement demand from April. He also stated that he would be out of the office the following week and invited further communication as needed.\n\nOn June 30, 2025, Bryce Koon replied, acknowledging receipt of materials and stating that his client disagreed with Lowery\u2019s characterization of the conditions at issue. In the interest of moving things forward, Koon indicated that his side was willing to reduce the settlement demand to $45,000. He also noted that discovery requests to Danny Wimmer Presents (DWP) were attached. Later that same day, Lowery responded that he would begin work on written discovery and that he hoped to obtain an extension to August 15, 2025, to provide full responses, since he believed the current deadline was imminent. He also raised questions about the designation of a corporate representative for the 30.02 deposition, requesting Bryce\u2019s consent to a draft notice including a formal list of topics so that designations and firm dates could be finalized, facilitating the filing process. Lowery also indicated that he had authority for one more increase in the settlement offer, proposing $15,000 inclusive of any liens for a full confidential settlement of Beck\u2019s claims, and asked Bryce to take this to his client for consideration.\n\nEarlier communications included a July 22, 2025, note from Bryce to Steven, following up on potential deposition dates for Beck. Bryce outlined the anticipated deposition topics consistent with the discovery requests, including control and maintenance of the property, any inspections or upkeep performed, the presence or absence of signage or warnings, and Danny Wimmer Presents\u2019 general safety policies on the premises. He also indicated that the deposition would cover whether steps were taken to evaluate or document the condition of the premises before or after the incident, and that once a date was confirmed, he would send a formal notice.\n\nA separate thread from June 30, 2025, showed Lowery\u2019s reply confirming readiness to proceed with written discovery and reiterating the two-week extension request to August 15, 2025, while noting he was out that week and would reach out if there was a counteroffer the following week. He also again referenced the ongoing process for a corporate deposition and indicated he would continue to push for a draft topics notice to finalize dates.\n\nIn the June 30 exchange, Bryce had previously stated that, in the interest of moving forward, his client would reduce the demand to $45,000 for settlement and that attached discovery requests to DWP would accompany the communication. He did not state any further changes to the settlement figure at that moment.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, Lowery\u2019s message referenced an attached letter responding to Beck\u2019s April standing demand and noted that he would be out of the office the next week, signaling a pause or delay in further immediate correspondence.\n\nBy July 29, 2025, the parties\u2019 communications escalated the focus on procedural matters and potential settlement. At about 9:45 a.m., Lowery advised Bryce that he sought an extension of about two weeks to August 15, 2025, to complete full responses to Beck\u2019s written discovery. He also requested Bryce\u2019s agreement to designate a corporate representative for deposition purposes and proposed that Bryce send a draft notice that would include a formal topics list, enabling finalization of designations and scheduling. Lowery then reaffirmed that he had authority to push the settlement offer upward, stating that the company would consider an increase to $15,000 as a full confidential settlement amount inclusive of liens, and asked Bryce to discuss this with his client.\n\nShortly after, Bryce replied that he was agreeable to extending Beck\u2019s client responses to August 15 and that he would provide a draft notice outlining topics, after which dates could be set. He also indicated he would discuss the proposed settlement increase with his client. Bryce provided his firm\u2019s contact details and reminded that the same confidentiality notices would apply to the correspondence.\n\nShortly thereafter, Steven proposed that Bryce confirm whether RFAs (Requests for Admissions) could also be extended to align with the IRFPDs (interrogatories and requests for production), noting that if Bryce agreed, he would prepare an Agreed Order.\n\nThe final exchange on July 29, 2025, at 11:13 a.m., saw Bryce respond simply, \u201cYes, that is fine,\u201d indicating agreement to extending the RFAs along with the other extensions and the plan for an Agreed Order once the draft notice and topics were finalized.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties\u2019 communications were sent with the usual attorney-client confidentiality notices and included the relevant participants\u2019 contact details and the Robin Willis Beck filevine email address in the CC field for coordination. The overarching arc of these messages shows a coordinated effort to extend discovery timelines, confirm the scope of deposition topics and a corporate representative, and proceed toward a potential confidential settlement while maintaining the option to adjust demands and formalize the process with an Agreed Order.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Robin-Willis-Beck-Premise-09-21-2023. Client: Robin Willis Beck. In the matter of Robin Willis Beck v. Danny Wimmer Presents (Jefferson County, 24-CI-000532), counsel exchanged a series of emails regarding an Agreed Order (AO) to address discovery requests, including RFAs, and related settlement discussions.\n\nThe exchange began with an email from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, dated June 30, 2025. In that message, sent to Steven B. Lowery, Esq., of Reminger Co., L.P.A., Bryce stated, \u201cYou may file. Thanks,\u201d and attached the AO for the RFAs and related discovery matters. The email included Bryce\u2019s firm contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. A confidentiality disclaimer followed, noting that the electronic message was intended only for the named recipient and that it may contain attorney-client privileged information; recipients were instructed to contact the firm if the message had been received in error and not to use or forward its contents to others not intended to receive them.\n\nEarlier that day, Steven Lowery had replied to Bryce, indicating that he would inform his team and begin work on written discovery, and that he would reach out if there was a counteroffer the following week.\n\nAlso on June 30, 2025, Bryce sent a separate reply that afternoon, to which he wrote, \u201cCounsel, Thank you for your letter and screenshots. We have reviewed the materials and respectfully disagree with your characterization of the conditions of the area in ques\u201d\u2014a sentence that trails off in the record.\n\nThe chronology continued on July 22, 2025, when Bryce sent another email to Steven regarding deposition logistics. He was following up on potential deposition dates for the client and described the anticipated deposition topics as those identified in the discovery requests, including, but not limited to, control and maintenance of the property, inspections or upkeep performed, the presence or absence of signage or warnings, and Danny Wimmer Presents\u2019 general policies regarding safety on the premises. He also indicated that the deposition would cover whether steps had been taken to evaluate or document the condition of the premises before or after the incident. Bryce concluded that once he received a date from Steven, he would send a formal notice.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, at 9:45 a.m., Steven Lowery wrote again to Bryce with a couple of key points. He requested an extension of written discovery by about two weeks, to August 15, 2025, noting that the current due date was imminent. He also proposed designating a corporate representative for the 30.02 deposition and asked Bryce to send a draft notice that would include a formal topics list, so Steven could finalize designations and firm dates for filing. In addition, Steven advised that he had authority to increase the settlement offer to $15,000, inclusive of any liens, for a full confidential resolution of the client\u2019s claims, and asked Bryce to present this offer to his client for consideration.\n\nA little later that same day, at 11:12 a.m., Steven again wrote to Bryce, asking for confirmation that Bryce agreed to extending the RFAs as well, since the RFAs would tie into the IRFPDs. If Bryce agreed, Steven said he would prepare an Agreed Order. Bryce replied at 11:13 a.m. with, \u201cYes, that is fine.\u201d\n\nAt 11:24 a.m., Steven followed up with a message stating, \u201cThanks Bryce. Attached is the AO. Let me know if you agree to the filing.\u201d The record then includes the accompanying confidentiality notices customary to these communications.\n\nThe correspondence around that time culminating in Bryce\u2019s 12:19 p.m. message dated July 29, 2025, and the subject line referencing the AO, included Bryce\u2019s closing note, \u201cYou may file. Thanks,\u201d along with his firm\u2019s contact information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer. The record also contains the initial header indicating the date of that message as Tuesday, July 29, 2025, 12:19:51 GMT-04:00.\n\nIn sum, the parties negotiated an Agreed Order to extend written discovery and RFAs, aligned RFAs with the IRFPDs, and contemplated extending the period for a deposition of the corporate representative, while also negotiating a lump-sum settlement offer of $15,000, inclusive of liens, for a full confidential settlement of the client\u2019s claims. The exchange reflects Steve Lowery\u2019s attempt to finalize an Agreed Order and Bryce Koon\u2019s readiness to file the AO, with both sides coordinating deposition topics, dates, and the scope of discovery and settlement. The record incorporates the standard confidentiality provisions seen in each correspondence and documents the contact details for the counsel and firms involved.",

Lowery of Reminger Co., L.P.A., with Robin Willis Beck SF 09/21/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address and Kristin M. Bluehs CC\u2019d. In the message, Aaron asked when discovery responses could be expected, noting that while there is an offer that Steven has made, it is difficult to evaluate without the basic pending discovery. He also apologized if the discovery had already been sent and he had missed it.\n\nSteven\u2019s reply to Aaron\u2019s inquiry was originally sent on October 2, 2025 at 2:18 PM (noted in the exchange). In his message, Steven stated that he looked forward to working with Aaron and that there was outstanding discovery to answer for Aaron\u2019s client, which would be delivered in short order. He reported that an increased offer to settle had been made\u2014to $15,000. He explained that, given Ms. Beck\u2019s medicals and the photographs he had submitted showing the general location where she testified to falling that night (which indicated lighting present), he believed the offer to be fair and did not anticipate receiving additional authority. Steven also said he did not recall any response from Aaron\u2019s client. He added that, absent an agreement, they would need to respond to Aaron\u2019s written discovery. Bryce had indicated he wanted a corporate representative deposition but did not submit a proposed topic list. From there, he suggested they would probably need a trial date. He closed by inviting Aaron to share his thoughts and offered to discuss the matter by phone. The message was signed by Steven B. Lowery, Esq., with direct contact at 502-625-7306 and affiliated with Reminger Co., L.P.A.\n\nEarlier still, on September 30, 2025 at 3:01 PM, Aaron had written to Steven and to Robin Willis Beck via the SF Filevine address. In that message, Aaron explained that Bryce was no longer working in his office and that Aaron was taking over the litigation. He noted that the last correspondence between Steven and Bryce appeared to be at the end of July or the first of August and expressed an effort to determine the current status and what steps were needed to move the case forward. Aaron\u2019s signature block followed, listing the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and the phone number 502-583-4022.\n\nThe communications include a standard confidentiality disclaimer from Aaron, indicating that the information in the email is confidential and intended only for the recipient or others authorized to receive it, that disclosure or action based on it by unintended recipients is prohibited, and that the email was scanned for viruses and malware by Mimecast Ltd.
