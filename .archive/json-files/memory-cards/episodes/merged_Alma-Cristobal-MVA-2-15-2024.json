      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal.\n\nOn April 1, 2024, an email thread concerning the liability decision for claim 2024346878 and the acknowledgement of a letter of representation (sent March 27, 2024) circulated between Jessa Galosmo of the Whaley Law Firm and Brenna Rine, a liability adjuster for transportation claims handling Crete Carrier Corporation, Shaffer Trucking, and Hunt Transportation Inc. The thread began with an email from Jessa Galosmo. At 7:13 AM she wrote to Brenna, stating she was following up on the liability decision for the claim and the acknowledgement for the letter of representation that had been sent on March 27, 2024. She signed as Jessa Galosmo of the Whaley Law Firm, providing her phone number (502) 357-9975 and fax number (502) 364-9363, and included a confidentiality notice indicating the transmission is privileged and confidential and should be delivered only to the named addressee(s). The notice also warned recipients that if they were not the intended recipient, they should notify the sender and delete the communication from their system, and that the material should not be copied, stored, or retained without consent.\n\nThe following portion of the thread shows a reply from Brenna Rine, dated April 1, 2024, at about 10:40 AM. In her reply, Brenna indicated, “Please see attached letters. Thank you,” and she provided her professional contact information: Liability Adjuster for Transportation Claims at 400 NW 56th Street, Lincoln, NE 68528, representing Crete Carrier Corporation, Shaffer Trucking, and Hunt Transportation Inc. Her office phone was (402) 323-4205, with fax (402) 479-8859, and her email was brine@transclaims.com.\n\nLater that same day, at 11:28:41 AM, the thread was forwarded to Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address, with the subject “Fwd: 2024346878.” The forwarded message retained the prior content: it was from Jessa Galosmo, and it included the header information showing the original recipient as the Filevine project email address and the date of the forward. The body of the forwarded message echoed Brenna’s prior note, “Please see attached letters,” and again carried Brenna’s signature block and the attached-letter reference.\n\nIn addition to the substantive exchanges, the messages include standard email cautions and disclosures. Jessa’s initial message contains the caution that the email originated outside the organization and advises not to click links or open attachments unless the sender and content are known to be safe. The thread also includes a confidentiality disclaimer common to such communications, stating that the transmission is privileged and confidential and intended only for the named addressee(s), with instructions for notification and deletion if received by the wrong party. The communications also repeat the contact information for both Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm and Brenna Rine of Trans Claims, as well as the associated companies involved in the claim.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal.\n\nOn May 23, 2024, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm forwarded to Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address a message titled “FW: Alma Socorro Cristobal Avendaño-Bill request.” The forwarded note begins with the line: “No records from Mary and Elizabeth Hospital but with UofL hospital.”\n\nThe forwarded chain then contains a message from May 22, 2024 at about 5:48 PM in the “Itemized Bills” thread, sent to Jessa Galosmo with the subject “FW: Alma Socorro Cristobal Avendaño-Bill request.” That message itself was a forwarding of a prior message from ULH Customer Service.\n\nThe original ULH message was sent on April 2, 2024 at 2:44 PM to Itemized Bills, with the subject “FW: Alma Socorro Cristobal Avendaño-Bill request.” It was authored by Robinlynn Brown, a Customer Service Specialist in Accounts Receivable Operation, whose email address is robinlynn.brown@uoflhealth.org. The message includes a lengthy description of UofL Health, Inc.: it is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation governed by an independent Board of Directors, and it is a related organization to the University of Louisville’s School of Medicine (defined under 42 CFR 413.17). UofL Health, Inc., on behalf of its teaching hospitals and providers, has an academic affiliation agreement with the University of Louisville whereby the University’s Health Sciences Center serves as the academic partner to maintain and enhance graduate medical education and its related research.\n\nThe message also contains a Confidentiality Disclaimer stating that the email and attachments are confidential and may contain protected health information (PHI) under HIPAA; if you are not the intended recipient, dissemination or copying is prohibited, and recipients should notify the sender or contact the UofL Health IT Service Desk at 502-588-7003 if the message was received in error.\n\nIn the April 2, 2024 ULH message, the sender addressed to Jessa: “Hi Jessa, We do not have any accounts for the dates request where patient was seen at Mary and Elizabeth Hospital. We do show patient was at UofL Hospital. Please respond with an updated request and authorization and I will gladly send to you. Thanks! Brenda S.”\n\nWithin the same thread, before the April 2 correspondence, the chain shows a prior message from Jessa Galosmo sent on Friday, March 29, 2024 at 10:57 AM to ULH Customer Service with the subject “Alma Socorro Cristobal Avendaño-Bill request.” That March 29 message contains a security notice: “SECURITY ALERT! This message is from an outside sender! Please review with caution and only open links you know are safe. Please click the ‘Report Phishing’ button on your tool bar to report this message to the security team for review.” The body of Jessa’s message is brief: “Hi, Please see attached file.” It is signed with all the standard closing lines from Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm, including contact information: Ph: (502)357-9975 and Fax: (502)364-9363.\n\nIn summary, the correspondence centers on an Alma Socorro Cristobal Avendaño bill request. The ULH response indicates there were no accounts for the dates when the patient was seen at Mary and Elizabeth Hospital, but records show the patient was at UofL Hospital, and an updated request with authorization was requested in order to proceed. The May 23 forwarding note explicitly records the statement that there were no Mary and Elizabeth Hospital records, only records at UofL Hospital. The attachments mentioned in the March 29 email are not shown in this note, but the message confirms that Jessa had sent an attachment and followed up with ULH accordingly.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter captioned Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024, the client is Alma Cristobal. The case is styled Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora, with docket numbers 108134 and 2024346878. The matter involves Alma Cristobal as the plaintiff and Crete Carrier Corporation as the defendant, and the file includes a Filevine project email address for Ala Cristobal.\n\nOn August 6, 2024, Aletha N. Thomas, a partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, wrote to Bryce Koon, of The Whaley Law Firm, stating that she had been retained to represent Crete Carrier Corporation and Roy Hamilton regarding an accident that occurred on February 15, 2024. She believed Bryce represented Alma Cristobal. Aletha attached a copy of the Answer she had filed on Crete’s behalf. She noted that Roy Hamilton had not yet been served, but she would file an Answer on his behalf after service. She also asked Bryce to send a copy of the discovery requests accompanying his Complaint to her in Word format. Aletha provided her firm’s contact details, including address (462 South Fourth Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202), telephone, and fax numbers, and she listed that the firm has offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. She included a confidentiality disclaimer stating that the email may contain confidential information and that, if received by someone not the intended recipient, review or distribution is prohibited, with instructions to inform her firm and destroy the transmittal. The message was followed by Kopka Pinkus Dolin’s standard signature and note about the firm’s relocation. This message was scanned for threats by Mimecast.\n\nBetween these communications, Bryce Koon subsequently sent an email to Aletha with the subject line referencing the same case, stating, “Please see attached. If there is anything else you need from me in this regard, please let me know.” In the header, the email identified Bryce as the sender and Aletha as the recipient, with cc’d addressees including agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Nichole M. Priddy at nmpriddy@kopkalaw.com, and Ala Cristobal’s Filevine project address (Ala Cristobal - Filevine Project Email Address).\n\nOn Friday, August 23, 2024, in a follow-up, Aletha N. Thomas wrote to Bryce, asking him to send the discovery requests to Crete in Word format. In the same message, Aletha noted Kopka Pinkus Dolin’s relocation: effective August 28, the firm would be moving to 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202; her email, telephone number, and fax number would remain the same. The firm’s offices remained in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. Aletha’s signature reiterated the confidentiality notice, and the message included the firm’s standard closing. The email chain also carried Kopka Pinkus Dolin’s confidentiality notice and the customary disclaimer about confidential content.\n\nThe entire exchange concludes with the standard attorney-client confidentiality notices and the Mimecast-scan certification indicating the messages were scanned for email threats.",

      "natural_language": "This note covers communications in the Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 case, involving client Alma Cristobal and related counsel and entities. The matter is titled Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 with the client listed as Alma Cristobal, and it concerns a February 15, 2024 accident involving Crete Carrier Corpora (as reflected in the subject lines of the exchanged emails).\n\nOn August 6, 2024, Aletha N. Thomas, a Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, wrote to Bryce Koon and Nichole M. Priddy. In that email, she stated she had been retained to represent Crete Carrier Corporation and Roy Hamilton regarding the February 15, 2024 accident. She believed Bryce Koon represented Alma Cristobal. Aletha attached a copy of the Answer she had just filed on behalf of Crete Carrier Corporation. She noted that Mr. Hamilton had not yet been served, but she would file an Answer on his behalf once he was served. She also indicated that she understood discovery requests had been propounded with the Complaint and asked Bryce to send her a copy of those discovery requests in Word format. The email included Aletha’s contact information and firm details: Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, 462 South Fourth Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202, with telephone numbers and office locations in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. A confidentiality notice accompanied the message, stating that the email may contain confidential information and, if received by an unintended recipient, review, copying, or distribution is prohibited; recipients were asked to destroy the original transmittal and notify the sender. It also provided a standard firm disclaimer and contact links and noted that the firm’s office was moving.\n\nThe same August 6 email contained a firm signature block for Aletha N. Thomas and reiterated the relocation information. It stated that the Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC offices would be relocating effective August 28 to 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202, while Aletha’s email address, telephone number, and fax number would remain the same. It also included the firm’s disclaimers, office locations, and links to their website, vCard, map, and email.\n\nOn August 23, 2024 at approximately 8:24 PM (note: the timestamp is recorded as 8:24?PM in the forwarding), Aletha followed up with Bryce Koon regarding the same matter. She wrote to Bryce, with Nichole M. Priddy CC’d, asking him to send her the discovery requests to Crete in Word format. The body of the message read: “Hi, Bryce, Just following up on this. Could you please send me the discovery requests to Crete in Word format? Thank you!” The email again carried Aletha’s Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC signature block, including their Louisville address and relocation notice, and included the confidentiality notice.\n\nThis August 23 email was part of a chain that was later forwarded. On August 24, 2024 at 09:16:19 AM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm forwarded the chain to Sarena Tuttle. The forwarded content began with the same headers and included the August 23, 2024 message from Aletha N. Thomas, as described above. The forward shows the Whaley Law Firm’s contact information: 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022, and the “Forwarded message” header and related copy of Aletha’s email.\n\nIn sum, the exchanged communications document Crete Carrier Corporation’s representation by Aletha N. Thomas in connection with the February 15, 2024 accident, the status of service on Roy Hamilton, the existence of discovery requests associated with the Complaint, and Aletha’s request to receive those discovery requests in Word format. They also establish that Bryce Koon may represent Alma Cristobal, that Aletha had filed an Answer on Crete’s behalf, and that Hamilton’s responsive pleading would follow upon service. The emails also provide Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC’s contact details, the firm’s relocation to a new Louisville address, and standard confidentiality notices, along with a forwarded chain that includes Whaley Law Firm’s involvement.",

The communications are between Aptiva Health and The Whaley Law Firm, with multiple recipients and copies.\n\nOn August 26, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, reported that Mrs. Cristobal had stopped by the office and described ongoing issues with her left shoulder and upper extremity. She stated there is continuous pain in the left shoulder that radiates down her side and sometimes into her left arm all the way to her first digit. She also noted puffiness in the clavicle region, although there was no discoloration at that time. Sarena requested that someone reach out to Mrs. Cristobal to schedule a follow-up appointment and to consider MRI imaging.\n\nLater that same day, August 26, 2024 at 3:54 PM, April Mullins, an A/R Specialist / Lien Negotiator and Attorney Liaison at Aptiva Health, replied to Sarena with a question: Is this still under Mrs. Cristobal’s 2/15/24 MVA? In her signature she identified herself and provided her contact information and company details, including that she had included Aptiva Health’s call center team to confirm appointment information once scheduling occurs.\n\nOn August 27, 2024 at 9:43 AM, Sarena responded to April with, “Good morning April, Yes, it is,” confirming that the case remains tied to the 2/15/24 MVA.\n\nThat same day, August 27, 2024 at 1:51 PM, April replied, “We can work on getting her back in. I have included our call center team who can confirm appointment information once she’s scheduled.”\n\nThe chain of communication also notes that the initial exchange carried the subject Alma Cristobal – New Appointment Request, and that Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm were CC’d, along with the Aptiva Health CallCenter.

She states that she has a continuous pain in her left shoulder that radiates down her side and sometimes into her left arm all the way to her 1st digit. She still has some puffiness in the clavicle region though it is not discolored at this time.\n Can someone please reach out to her for a follow up appointment and possible MRI imaging?\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma Cristobal (Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024) involves a new appointment request for the client Alma Cristobal. Over the dates of August 26–27, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health exchanged a series of messages to address follow-up care after a motor vehicle accident and to arrange an appointment, including consideration of MRI imaging if indicated.\n\nOn Monday, August 26, 2024, at 3:40 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, informed April Mullins that Mrs. Cristobal had visited the office that day and reported ongoing issues with her left shoulder and upper extremity. She described continuous pain in the left shoulder that radiates down the side and sometimes into the left arm all the way to the first digit, with puffiness in the clavicle region though there was no discoloration at this time. Sarena requested that someone follow up with the patient to schedule an appointment and consider possible MRI imaging.\n\nAt 3:54 PM later that day, April Mullins replied, asking whether this is still under the 2/15/24 motor vehicle accident. She noted that follow-up would be arranged and included her contact information along with Aptiva Health’s call center details, as well as the office address: Aptiva Health, 12300 Plantside Dr, Louisville, KY 40299. Her message carried her signature block with office and cell numbers (Office: 502-909-0772; Cell: 502-428-1346), email amullins@aptivahealth.com, and the website aptivahealth.com. The email also contained standard confidentiality language and images indicated by embedded cid attachments.\n\nEarlier the same day, at 9:43 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied to April: “Good morning April, Yes, it is,” confirming that the matter remained under the 2/15/24 MVA.\n\nIn another exchange at 9:51 AM on Tuesday, August 27, 2024, April Mullins wrote back: “We can work on getting her back in. I have included our call center team who can confirm appointment information once she’s scheduled.” This message also included April’s standard contact information and confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 10:11 AM on August 27, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded: “Awesome. Thank you so much,” indicating appreciation for the plan to schedule the appointment.\n\nFinally, at 3:42 PM on Tuesday, August 27, 2024, Lisa Acton sent an email to Sarena Tuttle and April Mullins, with Greg Whaley, Bryce Koon, and CallCenter CC’d. The subject was in reference to Alma Cristobal’s new appointment request, and the body stated, “Good morning, this patient has been scheduled for an appointment today with our provider. Thank you and have a good day!” This message confirms that an appointment was scheduled for the patient, with the call center to confirm appointment details.\n\nIn summary, the timeline shows the patient presenting with persistent left shoulder and upper-extremity pain after a February 15, 2024 motor vehicle accident, concerns about possible MRI imaging, and a coordinated effort between The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health to schedule an appointment for August 27, 2024, after confirming the case remains under the MVA, and arranging call-center support for appointment confirmation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. The client is Alma Cristobal, born 06/27/1990. On July 23, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm, through Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, sent a request for certified medical records and billing for Alma Cristobal to ULP Radiology Associates. The message was addressed to Sholanda Wilson at University of Louisville Physicians and was copied to Patient Services and ULH ROI. The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details appeared in the signature: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (D) 502-357-9971; office line (O) 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.” The email's subject was “Certified Medical Records & Billing Request - Alma Cristobal DOB 06/27/1990.” In the body, Sarena stated that on July 23, 2024, the firm requested certified medical records and billing on their client from ULP Radiology Associates, and she noted that on August 1, 2024, ULP had provided a response. However, after review, the billing for DOS 02/15/2024 remains missing, and she requested the request be reworked to cover any and all dates of service from 02/15/2023 through 07/23/2024, as listed on the request.\n\nThe email thread includes a later reply from Gannon Middleton, ROI Tech in Health Information Management at UofL Health, who wrote “Received” on July 23, 2024, at approximately 3:22 PM. Earlier in the thread, on the same day (Tuesday, July 23, 2024), Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Patient Services and ULH HIM ROI with the subject “Certified Medical Records & Billing Request - Alma Cristobal DOB 06/27/1990.” That message carried a security alert banner indicating it was from an outside sender and instructing caution, including guidance to review links carefully and to report phishing if necessary. In the body of that message, Sarena stated, “Good afternoon, Please find attached our office’s request for certified medical records and billing on the above referenced client. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.” The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, with the same contact information as above, and again noted the new email address.\n\nIn summary, the case involves a formal request for Alma Cristobal’s certified medical records and billing, originally sent July 23, 2024, with a follow-up on August 1, 2024 noting a missing DOS 02/15/2024 billing and requesting a rework to encompass all dates of service from 02/15/2023 through 07/23/2024, and it documents the email exchanges and acknowledgments that followed, including the initial attachment of the request and the acknowledgment from UofL Health’s ROI team.",

The matter involves a request for certified medical records and billing, coordinated between Dorothy Brown of Aptiva Health and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with the file maintained under Alma Cristobal.\n\nOn July 23, 2024, at 2:37 PM, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS), sent Dorothy Brown at Aptiva Health a request for certified medical records and billing for Alma Cristobal (DOB 06/27/1990). The email stated that this was the office’s request for certified medical records and billing for the referenced client and invited Dorothy to contact them if there were questions. The email included Sarena’s contact details and signature noting the new email address.\n\nOn July 29, 2024, at 4:39 PM, Dorothy Brown replied with the attached medical and billing records for Alma Cristobal, and included an image labeled cid:image001.png@01DB1105.6EE4AAF0.\n\nOn July 30, 2024, there was additional correspondence. At 9:28 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied, “Received, thank you so much Dorothy! :)” Later that day, at 9:31 AM, Sarena sent a follow-up message noting that, upon review, the certification page appeared to be missing and asking Dorothy to forward it. Dorothy responded later that day, at 2:41 PM, with the certification page included (and another image attached, cid:image001.png@01DB1105.6EE4AAF0), apologizing for the oversight. At 2:57 PM, Sarena replied, “No problem, thank you!”\n\nBetween July 30 and August 2024, the thread appears to have included ongoing coordination, but the next substantive update comes later in September.\n\nOn September 26, 2024, at 2:31 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Dorothy Brown requesting an update to the original request and certification to reflect follow-up visits Alma Cristobal had conducted at Aptiva in August. She asked that the request and certification be updated with Alma’s new records and billing.\n\nOn September 27, 2024, at 21:48:18 UTC, Dorothy Brown sent the updated records and bills, along with the certification page, confirming the updated documentation. The message stated, “Good afternoon, Here are the updated records and bills along with the certification page,” and was sent to Sarena Tuttle. The message also included a note and an image attachment (cid:image001.png@01DB1105.6EE4AAF0) as part of the updated certification page.",

This record(s) is not otherwise available. Our department needs additional time to prepare the records for release. Extension for release is necessary because the requested records require additional steps before it can be made available for public release. As the requested record was created during the course of police business, it is expected to contain a mixture of exempt and non-exempt information. The exempt information is likely of a personal nature of the involved person(s) or CJIS-protected information, which is prohibited from release.\n\nTo go further into detail which is specific to the process of researching, locating and redacting body/dash camera video requests. Currently, our unit only has four members who are solely responsible for the entire department's open records requests where body/dash camera video are being requested. (As well as any audio/video which are included in case file requests). For each request we are assigned we must conduct a search by officer and date. If video is located, we must determine whether an investigation/court case related to the incident is open. We then must download each video, one at a time, and then watch and manually redact any exempted information. We do this to protect the privacy of our citizens as well for CJIS security requirements. Unfortunately, only one item/image/sound may be redacted at a time; if there are multiple exempt items, they must be redacted individually. There is no automatic process to redact exempt items. For every minute of video it is estimated it takes 7 minutes of “redaction/review”. Some requests take as little as 30 minutes to an hour to complete, while some can take over a week. And often one request doesn't equal one video. Some requests can have two, five, ten, etc.\n\n \n\nFor all the reasons stated above, pursuant to KRS 61.872(5), the non-exempt responsive records will be made available on or before March 7th, 2025.\n\n \n\nTo remain fair and unbiased to requestors, we process in the order they are received. Our unit currently has an estimated 1,000+ pending requests for video. We are working as diligently as possible given the resources and personnel allotted to our unit. If we get to your request ahead of the quoted date, it will be provided earlier.\n\nVideo may be provided faster via subpoena if applicable.\n\n************************************************************************ \nQuestions about your request?

      "natural_language": "This note concerns Case Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 and the client Alma Cristobal. On October 15, 2024, at 14:11:33 UTC, Louisville Metro Government Public Records sent an external message regarding public records request #24-12999 to sarena@whaleylawfirm.com. The request sought body and dash camera video responsive to the inquiry.\n\nThe Public Records unit states that they located video responsive to the request, and that this record is not otherwise available. They need additional time to prepare the records for release. An extension is necessary because the requested records were created during the course of police business and are expected to contain a mixture of exempt and non-exempt information. The exempt information is likely of a personal nature related to the involved person(s) or CJIS-protected information, which is prohibited from release.\n\nThe message explains the process the unit follows to research, locate, and redact body/dash camera video requests. Currently, the unit has four members who are responsible for the department’s open records requests involving body/dash camera video and any audio/video included in case file requests. For each request, staff must search by officer and date. If video is located, they must determine whether an investigation or court case related to the incident is open. They then download each video one at a time, watch it, and manually redact any exempt information to protect citizens’ privacy and to meet CJIS security requirements. There is no automatic redaction; only one item, image, or sound may be redacted at a time, so multiple exempt items must be redacted individually. For every minute of video, it is estimated to take seven minutes to redact and review. Consequently, some requests take as little as 30 minutes to an hour, while others can take over a week. A single request does not necessarily correspond to a single video, as some requests may involve two, five, ten, or more videos.\n\nBased on these factors, and pursuant to KRS 61.872(5), the non-exempt responsive records will be made available on or before March 7, 2025. To remain fair and unbiased, the unit processes requests in the order they are received. They currently have an estimated 1,000+ pending requests for video and are working as diligently as possible given the resources and personnel allocated. If a request is completed earlier than the quoted date, it will be provided sooner. The notice also notes that video may be provided faster via subpoena if applicable.\n\nFor questions about the request, you may reply to the email or sign in to contact staff at Louisville Metro Government.

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal. Re: 108134: 2024346878: Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora: Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-004728).\n\nThe matter involves communications among counsel regarding discovery and scheduling in the case Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, filed in Jefferson County (24-CI-004728). On October 7, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with Nichole M. Priddy cc’d and Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address also included in the cc list (AlmaCristobalMVAZ4471403@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The subject of the message referenced the matter as 108134: 2024346878: Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora: Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-004728). Koon’s message stated that he was following up on discovery requests served to Defendant Crete and requested any updates. The email included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and a standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact the firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information. The message also contained a note indicating that the email had been scanned for threats by Mimecast, and included Kopka Pinkus Dolin’s confidentiality notice.\n\nOn October 9, 2024, at 3:42? PM, Aletha N. Thomas responded. She thanked Bryce for the email and his patience and advised that she was awaiting her client’s verification of the responses and would transmit them as soon as she received them. Her signature block identified her as a partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with office locations in Louisville; her contact details, and a standard confidentiality disclaimer similar to the one included in the prior message.\n\nOn November 1, 2024, at approximately 12:08 p.m., Bryce Koon, Esq., again wrote to Aletha Thomas and others, attaching the motion. He stated that the motion was set for Monday, November 11, at 9:45 a.m. and added that if their client’s responses were received prior to that date, he would be happy to remand the motion. He closed with his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm. The message included the same standard attorney-client privilege language and confidentiality notices, and reiterated the firm’s disclaimer about privileged information and the proper handling of the email if received in error. The email chain also included Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address in the cc list: AlmaCristobalMVAZ4471403@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nEarlier in the chain, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a separate note on November 1, 2024 at 2:02 p.m. to Bryce Koon and others. She advised that the motion hour had been moved by the clerk to November 12, 2024, due to Veterans Day on November 11. Her message included her contact details, including direct dial and office phone numbers, her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), and The Whaley Law Firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222). Her signature also indicated she provided the update in her capacity as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager. The email again carried standard confidentiality and privilege notices, including a reminder not to use or forward the information if received in error, and noting that it had been scanned for threats by Mimecast.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects an ongoing discovery process regarding defendant Crete in the Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation matter, with initial follow-ups on discovery in early October, a motion email in early November indicating a hearing set for November 11 at 9:45 a.m. (subject to remand if client responses were received beforehand), and a clerk-led rescheduling notice moving the hearing to November 12, 2024 due to Veterans Day. The communications involved counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, included Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project contact, and contained standard confidentiality and privilege notices common to attorney communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case file Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 concerns Alma Cristobal and Crete Carrier Corporation in the Jefferson County matter (case caption Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al., Jefferson 24-CI-004728). The client listed is Alma Cristobal. The note aggregates a series of email communications between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Aletha N. Thomas, Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with additional copies to Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address and to Nichole M. Priddy, as well as to Sarena Tuttle. The subject line tracks the docket: 108134 : 2024346878 : Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. The dates span from early October to November 1, 2024, and there is a motion attached to the November 1 message, with a hearing set for November 11, 2024 at 9:45 a.m.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas following up on discovery requests served to Defendant Crete, requesting any available update. The message was cc’d to Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project address and to Nichole M. Priddy, with the subject continuing to reference the Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation matter (Jefferson 24-CI-004728). The email closed with Koon’s firm’s contact information. A confidential-attorney-client privilege disclaimer accompanied the message, noting that if the email was received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information; a note also directed the recipient to the Kopka law firm website for further information, and a Mimecast-scan notice indicated the email had been checked for threats.\n\nIn response, on October 9, 2024, Aletha N. Thomas acknowledged Bryce’s email and expressed appreciation for his patience. She stated she was awaiting her client’s verification of the responses and would forward them as soon as she received them. Thomas’s signature block followed, showing her title as Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, the Louisville, Kentucky office address (101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202), phone and fax numbers, a direct line and cell number, and a note that the firm has offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. Her email signature also included a website link, a vCard, and a map link.\n\nEarlier, on October 7, 2024, Bryce Koon’s message had included a recurring subject line for the matter and a nominal follow-up request for updates on the discovery requests served to Crete Carrier Corporation. The email contained a standard confidentiality notice and privilege disclaimer, along with a reminder that the message had been scanned for threats by Mimecast.\n\nFinally, on November 1, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another email to counsel with the attached motion, noting that the motion is set for Monday, November 11, at 9:45 a.m. He stated that if they receive the client’s responses prior to that date, he would be happy to remand the motion. He invited any questions regarding this matter. This message carried the same confidentiality caveat and privilege language as the earlier communications, and the cc list again included Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address, Nichole M. Priddy, and Sarena Tuttle. The overall thread documents ongoing discovery efforts in the case and a pending motion with a hearing date set for early November.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. (Jefferson County 24-CI-004728), assigned case Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024, the client is Alma Cristobal. The Re line establishes the docket codes 108134 and 2024346878 in the caption, with the parties identified as Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. The communications involved The Whaley Law Firm and Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with the principal participants being Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm; W. Bryce Koon, Esq., also of The Whaley Law Firm; Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., and Nichole M. Priddy, Esq., both of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC; and Alma Cristobal via a Filevine project email address.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, Bryce Koon, Esq., wrote to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq. to follow up on discovery requests served to Defendant Crete, noting that any update would be appreciated. The email was sent at 3:38 PM and copied to Alma Cristobal (via Filevine Project Email Address) and Nichole M. Priddy. The message included standard firm disclosures and confidentiality notices, stating that the email may contain confidential information and that the recipient should not review, copy, or distribute it if not the proper recipient, with a warning to inform the sender and destroy the transmittal if received in error. The message also bore a disclaimer about attorney-client privilege and included Mimecast’s threat-scanning notice.\n\nAletha N. Thomas, in an email dated October 9, 2024 at 3:42 PM, responded to Bryce. She thanked him for the email and patience and said she was awaiting her client’s verification of the responses, which she would forward as soon as she received them. Her signature identifies her as a Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with offices listed in Louisville, Kentucky, and with additional offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. Her contact details and firm branding appeared in the message.\n\nLater, on November 1, 2024, Bryce Koon sent another email regarding the case. At approximately 12:08 PM (the time is noted as “12:08?PM” in the record), he advised counsel to review the attached motion, which was set for Monday, November 11, at 9:45 AM, and stated that if they received the client’s responses prior to that date, he would be happy to remand the motion. He closed with his contact details for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThat same day, at 2:02 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle wrote to counsel to convey that the motion hour had been moved by the clerk to November 12, 2024, due to Veterans Day on November 11. Her note included her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm and provided her direct lines and new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. Her signature block also listed the firm’s Louisville address and phone numbers (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104).\n\nThe November 1 communications carried the customary email confidentiality notices. Bryce’s message reiterated that the motion hour had been moved and referenced the attached motion and the potential for remand contingent on timely responses. The record also bears the standard firm disclaimers indicating that the messages are intended for the named recipients and may contain privileged information, with instructions to contact the sending firm if received in error, and to refrain from sharing or using the information beyond its intended recipient. The October 7 and October 9 exchanges likewise carried the firm’s confidentiality notices and Mimecast threat-scanning notices.\n\nIn summary, beginning with the October 7 discovery follow-up, through the October 9 client-verification update, and culminating in the November 1 scheduling communications, the parties discussed discovery responses and a motion in the Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation matter. On November 1, 2024, the motion’s original November 11, 9:45 AM time was adjusted to November 12, 2024 by the clerk owing to Veterans Day, with Bryce indicating flexibility to remand if client responses were provided beforehand.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 involves client Alma Cristobal in the matter Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. in Jefferson County (Jefferson 24-CI-004728). The file also references docket numbers 108134 and 2024346878 in connection with the case caption: Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. The communications center on the discovery process and a motion set for a scheduling date.\n\nOn October 7, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., a partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with copies to Ala Cristobal’s Filevine project email address AlmaCristobalMVAZ4471403@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Nichole M. Priddy, as well as to Alma Cristobal’s Filevine address and Sarena Tuttle at Whaley. The subject line echoed the case identifiers: 108134 : 2024346878 : Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora : Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corporation, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-004728). In his message, Bryce requested an update on the discovery requests served to Defendant Crete and noted that an attached motion was included. He stated that the motion is set for Monday, November 11, at 9:45 a.m., and that if they receive their client’s responses prior to that date, he would be happy to remand the motion. He invited any questions and closed with his contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email included a standard attorney-client privilege notice and instructions that the message is intended only for the named recipient, with a directive that if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not use or forward the information. The message also carried a Mimecast notice stating it had been scanned for threats.\n\nOn October 9, 2024, at 3:42 PM (noted as 3:42?PM in the thread), Aletha N. Thomas, also with Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, replied to Bryce. She thanked him for the email and acknowledged his patience, explaining that she was awaiting her client’s verification of the responses and would forward them as soon as she received them. Her signature identified her as a partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with office details: 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202; telephone 502.785.2818; fax 502.785.2812; direct line 502.785.2817; cell 270.307.1427. She noted that Kopka Pinkus Dolin has offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin, and provided website, vCard, map, and email resources.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Bryce’s October 7 message included copies to Ala Cristobal (the Filevine project address) and Nichole M. Priddy, along with the note that the email had been scanned for threats by Mimecast. The chain also included a closing line from Bryce’s message and the standard disclaimer language about attorney-client privilege, the prohibition on using or forwarding the information if received in error, and instructions to contact his firm.\n\nFinally, on November 1, 2024, at 12:07:57 PM Eastern Time, Bryce Koon sent another message to counsel. He stated: “Good afternoon counsel, Please see the attached motion. As you can see, the motion is set for Monday, November 11, at 9:45am. Should we receive your client's responses prior to this date, I will be happy to remand the motion. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.” He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address and phone and fax numbers repeated. The message again included the standard confidentiality notice: it is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledge no waiver of privilege, and refrain from using or forwarding the information. The note also indicated that the message had been sent to the named recipients and contained a Mimecast disclaimer about scanning for threats.",

The email included her firm’s contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address. A confidentiality disclaimer was included, stating that the email may contain confidential information and should be destroyed if received by the wrong recipient, and directing the recipient to visit www.kopkalaw.com for more information.\n\nEarlier that same day, Nichole M. Priddy, a legal assistant at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, replied to Bryce Koon and Sarena. She explained that Aletha’s calendar was booked from now until after the first of the year and, after reviewing Aletha’s calendar, proposed the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14 for the deposition. Nichole noted that Aletha would also want to depose Ms. Cristobal herself and asked for Ms. Cristobal’s schedule during that time frame. She also stated she would contact Mr. Hamilton to determine dates that would work for him so that the scheduling could be coordinated for all parties. Nichole signed the message as the Legal Assistant to Aletha N. Thomas, Partner, and Kristin Lomond, Senior Attorney, and provided her firm’s contact information: Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-785-2818; fax 502-785-2812; direct line 502-351-0242; cell 812-572-7588; email nmpriddy@kopkalaw.com; with offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn the thread, Nichole’s message was followed by the standard confidentiality notice, and the email from Sarena again included her note about a new email address and her firm’s contact details.\n\nThe following day, November 22, 2024, Sarena replied to Nichole. She suggested the week of February 3–7 for the deposition, noting that they were pushing the scheduling out and that Ms. Cristobal would be available during that same week. She asked Nichole to let them know what date and time would work best for Nichole’s office and for Mr. Hamilton. The email again carried Sarena’s contact details and the confidentiality notice, along with the reminder that the message originated from her new email address.\n\nThroughout the exchanges, the case information remained clear: Alma Cristobal was the client, the defendants were Crete Carrier and Roy Hamilton, and the parties were coordinating the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton, with Ms. Cristobal also to be deposed. The proposed deposition windows were the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14, with the preference to schedule as soon as possible within those windows, and Ms. Cristobal’s availability noted for the week of February 3–7.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal. Re: Alma Cristobal v Crete Carrier & Roy Hamilton - Deposition Scheduling. The email thread began with a message from The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena M.

The body of that message states, “The DC signed the Crete Discovery Request Responses as Counsel for Both Crete & Hamilton ??” The message is followed by Sarena’s standard signature block, which identifies her role and provides her contact information: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\n\nEarlier that same day, Bryce Koon had written in this thread at about 1:21 PM: “We are not ready for depositions. Defendant Hamilton still has not been confirmed served and has not responded to his own set of discovery. The only discovery we have is from the trucking company, who I do not want to depose.” This reflects his position that depositions were not yet ready because Hamilton had not been served and had not responded to discovery, and because the only available discovery came from the trucking company, which he did not want to depose.\n\nShortly thereafter, at about 1:18 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied to Mrs. Thomas: “Good afternoon Mrs. Thomas, It appears the initial written discovery has been completed by both parties and we are ready to move forward with scheduling the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton.

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024\nClient: Alma Cristobal\n\nIn the matter of Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corp. and Roy Hamilton (108134: 2024346878), deposition scheduling correspondence occurred between Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC and The Whaley Law Firm in late November 2024. The client is Alma Cristobal.\n\nOn November 21, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, wrote to Aletha N. Thomas and Nichole M. Priddy requesting dates for deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton, noting that the initial written discovery had been completed by both parties and that they were ready to move forward with scheduling. Nichole M. Priddy, a legal assistant at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC and assistant to Aletha Thomas and Kristin Lomond, replied later that day. She explained that Aletha’s calendar was booked from now until after the first of the year and, after reviewing Aletha’s calendar, proposed the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14 as potential windows. Nichole added that Aletha would also want to depose Ms. Cristobal and asked for Cristobal’s availability during that timeframe. She stated she would contact Mr. Hamilton to determine dates that would work for him so the deposition scheduling could be coordinated for all parties.\n\nThe following day, November 22, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded, suggesting the week of February 3–7 as a practical focus given how far out the scheduling had become. She noted that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week as well and asked Nichole and her office to indicate what dates worked best for their side and for Mr. Hamilton.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, Nichole M. Priddy informed Sarena that she had heard back from Mr. Hamilton, and he advised that February 5, 2025, would be suitable for his deposition, to be conducted via Zoom. This established a concrete date for the deposition of Roy Hamilton, with the expectation that the deposition of Alma Cristobal would also be arranged within the same scheduling window.\n\nThe correspondence indicates ongoing coordination to schedule the deposition of Roy Hamilton, with Aletha Thomas also intending to depose Alma Cristobal, within the suggested weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14, 2025, and with Mr. Hamilton’s availability confirmed for February 5, 2025, by Zoom. The exchange involved the principals and paralegals at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC and The Whaley Law Firm, respectively, to finalize a mutually workable deposition schedule for all parties.",

      "natural_language": "Narrative summary of deposition scheduling communications for Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corp. and Roy Hamilton (Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024)\n\nThe parties, Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corp. and Roy Hamilton, began coordinating the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton after the initial written discovery had been completed by both sides. On November 21, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Nichole M. Priddy of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC (cc’ing Aletha N. Thomas and Bryce Koon) to announce that the parties were ready to move forward with scheduling Mr. Hamilton’s deposition and to request dates when their offices and Mr. Hamilton would be available.\n\nLater on November 21, 2024 at 3:08 PM, Nichole replied that Aletha’s calendar was pretty booked from now until after the first of the year and proposed scheduling for the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14. Nichole noted that Aletha would also want to depose Ms. Cristobal and she would check with Mr. Hamilton to confirm dates that would work for all parties.\n\nOn November 22, 2024 at 9:06 AM, Sarena responded that they could look at the week of February 3–7 since they were already pushing out the schedule, and that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week. She asked Nichole to let them know what dates worked best for Kopka Pinkus Dolin and Mr. Hamilton, and she indicated they would accommodate accordingly.\n\nSubsequently, on November 26, 2024 at 9:29 AM, Nichole informed that Mr. Hamilton had advised February 5, 2025 would be good for him, and that the deposition would be conducted via Zoom.\n\nThat same day, November 26, 2024 at 10:52 AM, Sarena replied that February 5, 2025 via Zoom was perfect. She added a logistical question about timing: she asked how much time Mrs. Thomas would need, or typically takes, and proposed two possible schedules. One option was to start at 10:00 a.m. with Ms. Cristobal and to have Mr. Hamilton begin at 1:00 p.m. to allow time for lunch; alternatively, they could proceed immediately following the Cristobal deposition. She provided her contact information and signed off with her title and firm details. The overall plan remained to conduct the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton via Zoom on February 5, 2025, with Ms. Cristobal’s deposition to occur in the surrounding time window, subject to the parties’ schedules.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corp. and Roy Hamilton (Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024) concerns scheduling depositions in the Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier and Roy Hamilton matter. The parties’ counsel, Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, and The Whaley Law Firm coordinated a Zoom deposition schedule for Roy Hamilton, with Aletha Thomas (Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC) also intending to depose Alma Cristobal.\n\nOn November 21, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Aletha Thomas and Nichole Priddy asking for dates when their office and Mr. Hamilton would be available to depose him, noting that initial written discovery had been completed and they were ready to proceed with the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton.\n\nThat same day, Nichole Priddy, a legal assistant at Kopka Pinkus Dolin, replied that Aletha’s calendar was pretty booked from now until after the first of the year. She wrote that, upon review, they could offer the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14, and that Aletha would also want to take the deposition of Alma Cristobal as well. Nichole asked for Cristobal’s schedule during that time frame and said she would contact Mr. Hamilton to coordinate dates for all parties.\n\nThe following day, November 22, 2024, Sarena responded that they should look at the week of February 3–7, since they were already pushing the schedule out. She noted that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week and asked Kopka Pinkus Dolin to share dates that worked for their office and for Mr. Hamilton.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, Nichole Priddy informed Sarena that Mr. Hamilton advised February 5, 2025 would be suitable for a deposition via Zoom.\n\nThat same day, November 26, 2024, Sarena replied that February 5, 2025 via Zoom was perfect, and she asked whether they should start at 10:00 a.m. with Ms. Cristobal and then have Mr. Hamilton begin at 1:00 p.m. to allow time for lunch, or whether they should conduct the depositions immediately following one another.\n\nNichole Priddy responded later that day, agreeing with the proposed plan. She noted she was not sure how much time Aletha would need, but she thought the arrangement suggested by Sarena sounded good. The parties’ communications thus established a Zoom deposition for February 5, 2025, with Cristobal scheduled at 10:00 a.m. and Hamilton at 1:00 p.m., while allowing for Aletha’s potential needs.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corpora, docketed as Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024, the parties moved to schedule the deposition of Roy Hamilton after the initial written discovery had been completed. On November 21, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Nichole M. Priddy of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC (cc’ing Aletha N. Thomas and Bryce Koon) asking for dates that Mr. Hamilton and the offices could be available for deposition. The subject line of that message referenced the matter as 108134 : 2024346878 : Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora : Alma Cristobal v Crete Carrier & Roy Hamilton - Deposition Scheduling. In that note, Sarena wrote, “Good afternoon. It appears the initial written discovery has been completed by both parties and we are ready to move forward with scheduling the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton. Can you (or Nicole) please provide dates that your office and Mr. Hamilton are available for deposition?”\n\nLater that same day, November 21, 2024, Nichole replied that Aletha’s calendar was quite booked from now until after the first of the year and proposed the weeks of February 3–7 and February 10–14 as potential windows. Nichole also noted that Aletha would want to take the deposition of Ms. Cristobal as well and asked to be informed of Cristobal’s availability within that timeframe; she said she would contact Mr. Hamilton to coordinate dates for all parties. The message was signed with Nichole’s contact information and standard confidentiality notice.\n\nOn November 22, 2024 at 9:06 a.m., Sarena responded, suggesting that they look at the week of February 3–7 since they were already pushing things out and that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week as well. She asked Nichole to let them know what would work best for Kopka Pinkus Dolin and Mr. Hamilton.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, at 9:29 a.m., Nichole informed Sarena that she had heard back from Mr. Hamilton and that February 5, 2025 would be good for him, with the deposition to be held via Zoom.\n\nLater that morning, at 10:53 a.m., Sarena responded that February 5, 2025 via Zoom was perfect and asked for guidance on timing. She proposed starting at 10:00 a.m. with Ms. Cristobal and beginning Mr. Hamilton’s deposition at 1:00 p.m. to allow time for lunch, or alternatively proceeding immediately after Ms. Cristobal’s deposition. She signed off with her title and contact details, noting her new Whaley Law Firm email address.\n\nAt 1:18 p.m. on the same day, Nichole replied that the suggested plan sounded good and that she was not sure how much time Aletha would need, but she agreed with the proposed timing. Her message also carried Kopka Pinkus Dolin’s standard confidentiality notice and her contact information.\n\nFinally, at 2:14 p.m., Sarena sent a closing note confirming that she would obtain a deposition notice for Mr. Hamilton and send it over shortly, with her usual signature block and new email address.\n\nIn summary, after confirming that initial discovery had been completed, the team settled on scheduling the deposition of Roy Hamilton for February 5, 2025, via Zoom, with Ms. Cristobal’s deposition included in the same window. They discussed starting times—10:00 a.m. for Cristobal and 1:00 p.m. for Hamilton to allow for lunch, or proceeding consecutively—depending on the time Aletha Thomas would need. The coordinated dates were set within the week of February 3–7, 2025, within the broader February 3–14, 2025 timeframe, with Mr. Hamilton’s availability confirmed for February 5.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal. The matter is Alma Cristobal v Crete Carrier Corpora and Roy Hamilton, specifically the deposition scheduling for Mr. Roy Hamilton.\n\nA Notice to Take the Deposition of Mr. Hamilton was filed, with the subject line 108134 : 2024346878 : Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora : Alma Cristobal v Crete Carrier & Roy Hamilton - Deposition Scheduling. The notice was submitted by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and was filed moments ago via CourtNet Envelope 9361828.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue began on November 21, 2024, when Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Nichole M. Priddy (and copied Aletha N. Thomas) asking for dates when their offices and Mr. Hamilton would be available for deposition, noting that initial written discovery had been completed and they were ready to move forward with the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton. She asked whether her office or Nichole could provide dates.\n\nLater that same day, Nichole M. Priddy responded that Aletha’s calendar was pretty booked through the end of the year, and, after reviewing Aletha’s schedule, proposed the week of February 3–7 and the week of February 10–14 for scheduling. Nichole also indicated that Aletha would also want to depose Ms. Cristobal and asked to learn Cristobal’s availability in that time frame. Nichole also stated she would contact Mr. Hamilton to coordinate dates for all parties.\n\nOn November 22, 2024, Sarena replied that they should look at the week of February 3–7 since they were already pushing out, and that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week as well; she asked them to let her know what worked best for Nichole’s office and Mr. Hamilton.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, Nichole reported that Mr. Hamilton had advised February 5, 2025 would be good for him, and that the deposition would be via Zoom.\n\nLater that morning, November 26, 2024, Sarena responded that February 5, 2025 via Zoom was perfect and proposed scheduling with Ms. Cristobal’s deposition at 10:00 a.m. and Mr. Hamilton’s at 1:00 p.m. to allow for lunch, or alternatively continuing immediately after. She noted she was unsure how much time Aletha would need but suggested the times could accommodate that consideration.\n\nThat afternoon, November 26, 2024, Nichole wrote back agreeing with the proposal, stating she was not certain how much time Aletha would need, but that the plan as proposed sounded good.\n\nShortly after, at 2:14 p.m., Sarena indicated she would prepare and send the notice for Mr. Hamilton shortly.\n\nAt 2:14 p.m. (approximately), Sarena again confirmed she would prepare a notice for Mr. Hamilton and send it to Nichole shortly, with the notice subsequently being filed via CourtNet Envelope 9361828.\n\nIn short, the parties have coordinated to schedule the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton for February 5, 2025, to be conducted by Zoom, with a tentative plan to depose Alma Cristobal that same day beginning at 10:00 a.m., followed by Mr. Hamilton at 1:00 p.m., allowing for a lunch break if needed. The planning also anticipated including the deposition of Ms. Cristobal as part of the same scheduling window, reflecting Aletha Thomas’s calendar considerations and the overall coordination among The Whaley Law Firm and Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier Corpora and Roy Hamilton (Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024) involved a sequence of email communications in late November 2024 about scheduling the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton and Ms. Alma Cristobal. The matter was identified as 108134 with the caption 2024346878.\n\nOn November 21, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, sent an email to Nichole M. Priddy of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC (along with Aletha N. Thomas and Bryce Koon on copy) noting that initial written discovery had been completed by both parties and requesting available dates for the deposition of Mr. Roy Hamilton. \n\nLater that day, Nichole replied that Aletha’s calendar was booked for the near term and proposed two blocks of time for depositions: the week of February 3–7, 2025 or the week of February 10–14, 2025, with the deposition of Ms. Cristobal to be included as well. She added that she would contact Mr. Hamilton to determine which dates would work and provided a link to her vCard for easy contact.\n\nOn November 22, 2024, Sarena responded that the week of February 3–7, 2025 was preferable given the current scheduling, and that Ms. Cristobal would be available that week. She asked Nichole to confirm what would work best for Kopka Pinkus Dolin and for Mr. Hamilton.\n\nBy November 26, 2024, Nichole reported that Mr. Hamilton had advised February 5, 2025 would be suitable for a deposition via Zoom. Sarena replied that February 5, 2025 via Zoom was perfect and raised a question about timing: whether to start at 10:00 a.m. with Ms. Cristobal and have Mr. Hamilton begin at 1:00 p.m. to allow for lunch, or to schedule the depositions back-to-back immediately after one another. Nichole responded that the proposed times sounded good, though she could not say in advance how much time Aletha would need.\n\nSarena then stated that she would prepare a deposition notice for Mr. Hamilton and send it shortly. She later informed Nichole that the notice for Mr. Hamilton had been filed via CourtNet under envelope 9361828.\n\nSeparately, Nichole had noted in a November 26, 2024 email that she would get the Notice for Ms. Cristobal over to the opposing office shortly, indicating that notices for both deponents were being pursued in connection with the case.\n\nIn summary, the parties coordinated scheduling for depositions in February 2025, with Mr. Hamilton set for February 5, 2025 (via Zoom) and Ms. Cristobal available that same week. The proposed morning and afternoon slots were discussed (Ms. Cristobal around 10:00 a.m. and Mr. Hamilton around 1:00 p.m., to allow lunch), and notices for the depositions were prepared and filed (Mr. Hamilton’s notice filed via CourtNet as envelope 9361828; Ms. Cristobal’s notice to be sent separately).",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns the case Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024, involving client Alma Cristobal, with the matter titled Certified Medical Records & Billing Request - Alma Cristobal. The Whaley Law Firm represents the client, and the communications are with Starlight (also referred to as Starlite) Chiropractic. The December 11, 2024 email was sent by Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, to Gail at Starlight Chiropractic, with two Starlight addresses included (lgsweasy@gmail.com and starlitechiro@gmail.com), and with CCs to Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) and Muhammad Alif (stimulus110@yahoo.com). The message was dated Wednesday, December 11, 2024, at 13:44:57 -0500.\n\nIn this December 11 communication, Sarena stated that they still had not received the Certification page for the attached records and bills that had been discussed on October 7, 2024. She explained that if a claim is in litigation, they cannot file the records or bills with the courts without a completed, signed certification page. She added that if the proper certification is not received, the treatment and/or bills cannot be considered for payment, and she urged Gail to expedite the required certification as soon as possible. The message included The Whaley Law Firm’s standard signature block, noting the new email address and providing direct and office phone numbers, along with the firm’s mailing address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.\n\nThe chain also shows prior correspondence. On October 7, 2024, at approximately 11:46 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote, “Please find the CRR w/Certification Page Attached,” followed by the same signature block and contact information, including the note about the new email address. Before that, a forwarded message from July 23, 2024, at 2:21 PM, indicated that Sarena had sent an email to Starlite Chiropractic (and StarliteChiro@gmail.com) with the subject Certified Medical Records & Billing Request - Alma Cristobal. In that July message, she stated: “Good afternoon Gail, Please find attached our office's request for certified medical records and billing on the above referenced client. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.” The signature block following that message again listed Sarena M. Tuttle’s role, the firm’s address, direct and office phone numbers, the email contact, and the note to use the new email address.\n\nTaken together, the record shows a sequence of communications from The Whaley Law Firm to Starlight/Starlite Chiropractic regarding certified medical records and billing for Alma Cristobal, culminating in a December 11, 2024 email stressing that the critical Certification page has not been received since the October 7, 2024 discussion, and outlining the consequences for filing and payment if the certification is not provided promptly.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024 concerns Alma Cristobal, born 06/27/1990, in a motor vehicle accident matter. The note set documents an ongoing Certified Medical Records and Billing request, with a detailed email chain between The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health.\n\nOn January 21, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Dorothy Brown at Aptiva Health, copying Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm. In that message, she stated that, after reviewing the attached records for Alma Cristobal, the first few visits appear to be missing: specifically the dates 04/02/2024, 04/08/2024, and 05/16/2024. She requested that those dates of service be added and that the package be sent with a corrected certification page. The message included Sarena’s contact details, noting a new email address (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) and listing her direct and office lines, as well as The Whaley Law Firm’s mailing address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. It also reiterated that Dorothy Brown’s communication should be sent from the Aptiva Health address and that Bryce Koon should be cc’d; the subject line again referenced Certified Medical Records & Billing Request for Alma Cristobal, DOB 06/27/1990.\n\nThe historical thread begins with a July 23, 2024 email in which Sarena requested certified medical records and billing for Alma Cristobal (DOB 06/27/1990). On July 29, 2024, Dorothy Brown replied that she had attached the updated records and bills, along with the certification page. Shortly thereafter, there was back-and-forth about the certification page: on July 30, 2024, Dorothy wrote, “Sorry about that. Here is that certification page.” In the same exchange, Sarena indicated that, upon review, it appeared the certification page was still missing and asked Dorothy to forward it; Dorothy subsequently responded with a confirmation that the certification page had been sent, and Sarena acknowledged receipt. The dated sequence shows multiple confirmations and acknowledgments around the certification page and the accompanying records.\n\nIn an ongoing process later in 2024, on September 26, 2024, Sarena explained that Alma had returned to Aptiva in August for follow-up visits and asked Dorothy to update the request and certification with those new records and billing. Dorothy responded on September 27, 2024 by providing updated records and bills, along with the certification page. On September 30, 2024, Sarena acknowledged receipt of those updated materials.\n\nThis sequence reflects a sustained effort to compile Alma Cristobal’s certified medical records and related billing, including updates to capture post-August follow-up visits and the necessary certification pages, with communications spanning from July 2024 through September 2024, and a final clarification and reminder on January 21, 2025 about missing early visits (04/02/2024, 04/08/2024, and 05/16/2024) requiring inclusion in the certified package.",

      "natural_language": "The matter is Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024, involving client Alma Cristobal in the lawsuit Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al., Jefferson County docket 24-CI-004728 (caption noting 108134 : 2024346878). The case file identifies the client as Alma Cristobal and the matter is a motor vehicle accident matter.\n\nOn April 11, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC with the subject line referencing 108134 and 2024346878 in the Cristobal v. Crete Carrier case. In that message, Bryce attached Plaintiff’s Supplemental Discovery Requests along with the associated notice filed that day and invited any questions. The email included standard attorney-client privileged/confidential notices and a disclaimer about not sharing the information if received in error, plus a note indicating that the email had been scanned for threats by Mimecast. The message was sent from Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm, and Alma Cristobal was CC’d via the Filevine Project Email Address AlmaCristobalMVAZ4471403@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nSubsequently, on May 13, 2025 at 11:09 AM, Bryce Koon wrote again to counsel: “Good afternoon counsel, Just following up on these requests. Any update appreciated.” This message likewise carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nOn May 20, 2025 at 3:09 PM, Bryce sent another follow-up to Aletha N. Thomas regarding the same matter, with the subject line continuing the Cristobal v. Crete Carrier thread. The email stated: “Good afternoon counsel, Following up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect responses.” Alma Cristobal was again included via the Filevine address in the communication, and Bryce’s message noted an [image: Image removed by sender.] placeholder, as did the prior exchanges. The email kept the same attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimers and Mimecast threat-scanning notice.\n\nOn May 21, 2025, at 9:39 AM, Aletha N. Thomas replied to Bryce, apologizing for the delay and stating she would work on the materials and get them to him as soon as she could, adding that she should be able to provide them within one week. Her signature identified her as a Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with office contact details: 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, Louisville, KY 40202; T: 502.785.2818; F: 502.785.2812; Direct: 502.785.2817; Cell: 270.307.1427; and noting offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky and Wisconsin. The message, like the others, contained the standard privilege and confidentiality notices and the note about email threat scanning.\n\nLater that same day, at 9:40 AM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon replied: “Sounds good. Thank you.” The exchange continued to reference the case caption and the discovery requests, with Alma Cristobal included via the Filevine address as before and the standard email disclaimers accompanying each message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. The client is Alma Cristobal, involved in the matter Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al., Jefferson County case number 24-CI-004728.\n\nIn a message dated May 28, 2025 at 10:58:35 GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a communication regarding the ongoing discovery in the case. The email was addressed to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., with Alma Cristobal cc’d via the Filevine project email address. The subject line referenced the case caption and number. In the body, Koon explained that it appears responses were received to the wrong supplemental discovery set. He stated that the discovery served in April and included in the thread consists of Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34, which inquire about EDR information. He offered to resend the correct set if needed. The message included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, noting the intended recipient and advising that if the message or attachments were received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and not disclose or forward the contents.\n\nPrior to that, a chain of earlier messages shows a sequence of follow-ups from Koon. On May 27, 2025 at approximately 3:15 PM (noted as 3:15?PM), Koon wrote to counsel: “Good afternoon counsel, Circling back on this one more time. Thanks,” signing again as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the same firm contact details and the same privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier still, on May 20, 2025 at about 3:09 PM (3:09?PM), Koon wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, Following up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect responses.” He again signed with his firm information and included the confidentiality notice.\n\nOn May 13, 2025 at roughly 11:09 AM (11:09?AM), he wrote: “Good afternoon counsel, Just following up on these requests. Any update appreciated.” The signature block and privilege notice followed.\n\nOn April 11, 2025 at 3:26 PM (3:26?PM), Koon sent: “Good afternoon counsel, Attached please find Plaintiff's Supplemental Discovery Requests along with the associated notice filed today. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.” This message, too, carried the Whaley Law Firm signature block and the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nAcross the thread, the communications reflect an ongoing effort by The Whaley Law Firm to obtain timely responses to the plaintiff’s supplemental discovery requests, with the most recent May 28, 2025 email clarifying that the wrong set had been provided and offering to resend the correct Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34 related to EDR information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal. This matter is Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al., with the Jefferson County case identified as 24-CI-004728, and the broader references 108134, 2024346878. The subject line records the caption as Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora and Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al.\n\nThe most recent substantive communication comes from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, in an email dated May 29, 2025 at 10:25:52 a.m. Eastern Time. In that message, sent to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., with Alma Cristobal and Nichole M. Priddy copied, Koon states “Not a worry. Please see attached.” The message includes standard attorney‑client privilege language asserting that the electronic transmission is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; it provides instruction to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error and to refrain from using or forwarding the information. The Whaley Law Firm contact details are listed (Bryce Koon’s address, phone, and fax), followed by the firm’s disclaimer language. The email’s subject reiterates the case caption and docket information.\n\nEarlier that same week, on May 28, 2025, Aletha N. Thomas replied to Bryce, apologizing for the confusion and explaining that she had located the PDF of the second supplemental discovery requests but could not locate a Word version. She asked Bryce to send the Word document and indicated she would begin work immediately. Thomas’ signature shows she is a Partner at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with the Louisville, Kentucky office listed at 101 South Fifth Street, Suite 1670, along with phone, direct line, fax, and cell contact information and a note that the firm maintains offices in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. The email footer also includes links and a note about the firm.\n\nIn Bryce’s May 28, 2025 10:59 a.m. reply, he clarifies that the discovery responses currently circulating pertain to the wrong supplemental discovery set. He explains that the discovery served in April—the set referenced in the thread—consisted of Interrogatories 28-30 and RFPDs 32-34, which inquire about EDR information. He offers to resend the correct materials if needed. The message contains the standard confidentiality disclaimer and an image placeholder indicating content previously included.\n\nA day earlier, on May 27, 2025 at 3:15 p.m., Bryce wrote to counsel: “Good afternoon counsel, Circling back on this one more time.” This message is followed by Bryce’s firm contact information and the same confidentiality boilerplate.\n\nOn May 20, 2025 at 3:09 p.m., Bryce again wrote: “Following up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect responses.” The email again includes the typical firm signature and confidentiality language.\n\nEarlier still, on May 13, 2025 at 11:09 a.m., Bryce sent: “Good afternoon counsel, Just following up on these requests. Any update appreciated.” The message carries the same signature and confidentiality notice as the others.\n\nThe trail begins with an April 11, 2025 3:26 p.m. email from Bryce Koon: “Attached please find Plaintiff's Supplemental Discovery Requests along with the associated notice filed today. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.” This message, too, includes Bryce’s standard Whaley Law Firm signature and the confidentiality notice, along with a footer note about Kopka law firm information and a notice that the email has been scanned for threats by Mimecast.\n\nIn sum, this case note documents a sequence of discovery communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC concerning Plaintiff's Supplemental Discovery Requests and the correct set of discovery materials (with ongoing issues about whether the proper documents were being exchanged, specifically regarding EDR information). The communications span April and May 2025, include multiple follow-ups, a request to supply a Word version of the second supplemental requests, and a note that the received responses appeared to pertain to a different discovery set (Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34). The chain identifies the involved parties, the docket caption, and the relevant case identifiers, while preserving the attached notices, PDFs, and the standard privilege and confidentiality disclosures accompanying these attorney communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. The client is Alma Cristobal. This narrative covers the email communications in the matter titled Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al., Jefferson County case number 24-CI-004728, and associated file references 108134 and 2024346878. The header shows the file is labeled “Cristobal, Alma v. Crete Carrier Corpora” with the matter listed as Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al. The subject line of the principal exchange is Re: Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-004728).\n\nOn June 30, 2025, at 12:49:48 PM Eastern time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with copies to Alma Cristobal’s filevine project address and Nichole M. Priddy, Esq. The message was a follow-up regarding supplemental discovery requests and requested any available update. The email footer repeatedly contained the standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimer. The sender’s contact information listed The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on May 29, 2025 at approximately 10:25 AM (the timestamp shows a question mark in the original), Bryce Koon replied “Not a worry. Please see attached,” signaling that he had attached the requested documents. This message also included the same confidentiality disclaimer and the Whaley Law Firm contact details.\n\nThe chain traces back to May 28, 2025, when Aletha N. Thomas responded to Bryce. She apologized for the earlier confusion and explained that she had found the PDF of the second supplemental discovery requests but could not locate a Word version; she asked Bryce to send the Word version so she could begin work immediately. Her message also carried Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC’s standard signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nAlso on May 28, 2025, at 10:59 AM, Bryce Koon sent a message to Aletha Thomas explaining that the discovery served in April, which is documented in the April email thread, appeared to be the wrong supplemental discovery set. Specifically, he noted that the April discovery consisted of Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34, which inquired about EDR information. He offered to resend the correct materials if she needed them. This email likewise carried the Dr. confidentiality notice.\n\nThe sequence continues with Bryce’s earlier messages in the same thread, beginning on May 27, 2025 at 3:15 PM, where he wrote to counsel, “Circling back on this one more time.” He signed his messages with the Whaley Law Firm letterhead and the same contact information and confidentiality language as in other emails.\n\nPrior messages in the thread show Bryce’s repeated outreach to Aletha, beginning on May 20, 2025 at 3:09 PM with a request for an update on when responses might be expected, followed by May 13, 2025 at 11:09 AM and April 11, 2025 at 3:26 PM. In the April 11 email, Bryce attached Plaintiff’s Supplemental Discovery Requests along with the associated notice filed that day and invited questions. Each of these messages carried the same standard confidentiality statement.\n\nThe thread also includes the broader context of communications among counsel about the discovery sets, including references to Interrogatories 28–30, RFPDs 32–34, and EDR information, and an indication that the April discovery set had been misdirected. The participants repeatedly referenced the need to obtain and exchange the proper Word version of the second supplemental discovery requests and to coordinate the timing of production and responses.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects ongoing efforts between The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon) and Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC (Aletha N. Thomas), with Alma Cristobal and Nichole M. Priddy on the client side, to locate and exchange the correct second supplemental discovery requests (with attention to EDR information), rectify an earlier misdirected set, and secure timely responses, all within the framework of the Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier matter in Jefferson County (24-CI-004728). The communications consistently included standard confidentiality notices and repeated assurances about providing attachments and resending files as needed.",

Any update appreciated.”\n- May 20, 2025 at 3:09 PM: Bryce again asked, “Following up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect responses.”\n- May 27, 2025 at 3:15 PM: Bryce stated, “Good afternoon counsel, Circling back on this one more time.”\n- May 28, 2025 at 10:59 AM: Bryce sent a message noting that the discovery served in April (and contained in the thread) consisted of Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34, which inquire about EDR information. He offered to resend if needed.\n- May 28, 2025 at 2:55 PM: Aletha responded, apologizing for the confusion, noting that she had found the PDF of the second supplemental requests but could not locate a Word version and asking Bryce to send it over so she could start work promptly.\n- May 29, 2025 at 10:25 AM: Bryce replied, “Not a worry. Please see attached.” This indicated that a Word version or the necessary document was being shared again to move the process forward.\n- The thread includes the standard attorney-client privilege disclosure included in each electronic message, stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; recipients who receive the message in error should contact the sender and refrain from sharing or using the contents.\n\nOn June 30, 2025 at 12:49 PM, Bryce sent another follow-up message to counsel: “Good afternoon counsel, Following up on this one again. Please advise when we may expect responses.” The communication pattern shows ongoing efforts to obtain supplemental discovery responses related to EDR information.\n\nMost recently, on July 7, 2025 at 3:26:25 PM (GMT-04:00), Bryce sent a further follow-up: “Counsel, Following up again. Please advise.” The email was directed to Aletha N. Thomas at Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with copies to Nichole M. Priddy and Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address, and included the same business contact details for The Whaley Law Firm as in prior messages. The tone remains a request for an update regarding the supplemental discovery requests.\n\nContact details present in the messages show:\n- The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207; The firm’s signature identifies Bryce Koon, Esq.\n- Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC: Aletha N. Thomas, Partner; Offices listed in Kentucky (and other states), with direct line, cell, and general contact channels in the signature block of the May 28, 2025 correspondence.\n\nIn summary, this chain documents a persistent effort by counsel for Alma Cristobal to obtain supplemental discovery responses related to EDR information in the Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier matter (Jefferson County, 24-CI-004728), including multiple follow-ups from May through July 2025, a note indicating that the April-disclosed set contained in the thread consisted of Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34, and exchanges aimed at obtaining a Word version of the second supplemental discovery requests and any accompanying attachments. All messages include the standard privilege disclaimers typical of attorney communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Alma-Cristobal-MVA-2-15-2024. Client: Alma Cristobal. The matter is Alma Cristobal v. Crete Carrier, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-004728), and the file references include 108134 and 2024346878. On July 23, 2025, at 11:53:35 GMT-04:00, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Aletha N. Thomas, Esq., of Kopka Pinkus Dolin PC, with Nichole M. Priddy and Alma Cristobal’s Filevine project email address copied. The subject line recaps the case, and the body asks counsel to advise when responses to the supplemental discovery requests may be expected. The message includes The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and a standard attorney‑client privilege disclaimer, noting that the message is for the named recipient only and that any error should be reported, with a reminder not to use or disclose privileged information.\n\nThe email chain preceding this request shows a persistent follow-up regarding the supplemental discovery requests. On May 13, 2025 at 11:09 AM, Bryce Koon wrote an earlier message (content not provided in the record). On May 20, 2025 at 3:09 PM, Koon again urged counsel to advise when responses might be expected. On May 27, 2025 at 3:15 PM, he wrote again: “Good afternoon counsel, Circling back on this one more time.” On May 28, 2025, at 10:59 AM, Koon explained that the team had received responses to the wrong supplemental discovery set and identified the April-disclosed discovery as Interrogatories 28–30 and RFPDs 32–34, which concern EDR information, offering to resend the correct materials if needed. Later that same day, at 2:55 PM, Aletha N. Thomas replied that she had found the PDF of the second supplemental requests but could not locate a Word version and asked Bryce to send it; she stated she would begin work immediately. Bryce responded on May 29, 2025, at 10:25 AM, that there was “Not a worry” and that he would attach the appropriate documents. The chain also included the usual privilege notices in each message. On June 30, 2025 at 12:49 PM, Bryce followed up again: “Good afternoon counsel, Following up on the supplemental discovery requests. Any update appreciated.” Finally, on July 7, 2025, at an approximate 3:26 PM, Bryce wrote: “Counsel, Following up again. Please advise.” The most recent message in the record, dated July 23, 2025, continues the request for responses to the supplemental discovery requests that were served in this matter.",
