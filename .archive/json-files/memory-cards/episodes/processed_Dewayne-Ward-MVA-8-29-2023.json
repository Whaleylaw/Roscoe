      "natural_language": "Case: Dewayne-Ward-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Dewayne Ward. This matter concerns Liberty Mutual Claim # 054658453-07 with the date of accident listed as August 29, 2023.\n\nOn September 1, 2023, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Steven Flynn of Liberty Mutual regarding the Liberty Mutual claim for Dewayne Ward. In that message, she wrote that she attached the police report for Dewayne Ward\u2019s accident and signed off with her contact details: Whaley Law Firm, Ph: (502) 357-9975, Fax: (502) 364-9363. The message carried the subject line pertaining to the Liberty Mutual claim and Dewayne Ward, and it included the claim details in the header. The email also contained standard policy and privacy notes typical of Liberty Mutual communications, including directions about where to email documents (imaging@libertymutual.com) and a disclaimer about not sharing the email if the recipient was not the intended party.\n\nIn his reply on September 1, 2023 at 3:51 PM, Steven Flynn, CPCU, a Senior Claims Resolution Specialist for Liberty Mutual and Safeco Insurance, thanked Jessa for providing the police report. He noted the conflicting accounts indicated in the police report and stated his desire to set a date and time next week to obtain Mr. Ward\u2019s recorded statement, asking Jessa to provide some dates and times that would work for her and her client. His message also contained Liberty Mutual\u2019s standard contact information, including his direct phone line (314-682-0668), fax (866-567-2552), and the usual postal addresses for Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, as well as the note that all Liberty Mutual Claims Employees are currently working from home and that correspondence should be sent by email for faster processing. He reiterated the privacy and recipient-disclosure cautions and provided the usual instructions about where to email claim documents and the privacy policy link.\n\nThe thread continued on September 5, 2023. At 12:42 PM, Flynn sent another message reiterating the request to set dates and times to obtain Mr. Ward\u2019s recorded statement, again asking for available dates and times for Jessa and the client. The content and contact details mirrored his previous communications, including the standard Liberty Mutual signatures and the emphasis on email as the preferred mode of correspondence. The message again listed the relevant postal addresses, direct phone, and fax numbers, along with the same privacy and identification disclaimers.\n\nLater on September 5, 2023 at 2:32 PM, Jessa replied to Flynn. She stated that she was still waiting for the client\u2019s response regarding availability for the recorded statement and that she would communicate the information as soon as it was received. Her reply was CC\u2019d to the DewayneWardMVAZ3888219@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com address, and it contained the same general contact and privacy context that appears in the prior messages, including continuation of the standard disclaimers about confidentiality and proper recipient handling.\n\nIn summary, the communication history centers on securing a date and time for Dewayne Ward\u2019s recorded statement due to inconsistencies in the police report, with Liberty Mutual requesting availability from both Jessa Galosmo and her client, and Jessa indicating she would confirm once the client\u2019s schedule was determined. The chain includes the initial attachment of the police report, subsequent requests to schedule the recorded statement, and standard Liberty Mutual contact information and privacy notices embedded in the exchanges.",

The CC line also reflected several Filevine project addresses corresponding to the MVA plaintiffs (Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023) and Janet Weile of Skofirm, among others, and included Sarena Tuttle.\n\nThe email chain continued on May 19, 2025. At 10:08 a.m. Eastern Time, Zachary Reichle of SKO sent a new message to counsel, requesting an additional thirty days to finalize the Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. He noted that the current deadline was June 4 and explained that extending by thirty days would push the due date to July 7, since thirty days from June 4 would be July 4 and the following two days fell on a weekend.\n\nLater that same day, at 1:43:26 p.m. Eastern Time, Bryce Koon responded from The Whaley Law Firm with a succinct agreement: \u201cJuly 7th is fine with me. If you need anything else from me, please let me know.\u201d His reply included his standard signature block with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact information and carried the same confidentiality and privilege notices as the May 5 message. The email chain again reflected the same defense\u2013plaintiff discovery context for the Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson case.",

The notice reiterated that if the recipient is not the intended recipient, they should not forward or disclose the content.\n\nThe forwarded thread also included an earlier message from July 15, 2025, at 10:44 AM, sent by Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, to counsel. In that message, Reichle asked good morning and followed up on the status of Plaintiffs\u2019 responses to Defendant\u2019s discovery requests. He noted that the records indicated the responses were originally due July 9, but no responses had been received and no extensions of time had been requested. Reichle provided his contact details: zachary.reichle@skofirm.com, direct line 317.224.2473, and the firm\u2019s address at 334 N Senate Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46204, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Evansville, Frankfort, and Jeffersonville offices listed.

Torres attached copies of discovery requests served that day, in both Word and PDF formats, and enumerated six items:\n\n1) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams;\n2) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams;\n3) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore;\n4) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore;\n5) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward;\n6) Defendant Naomi Robinson's First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward.\n\nTorres closed the message with an offer to address any questions and provided her direct line as 317.61.4224, noting the City as Indianapolis. The cc line listed Zachary Reichle, Dennis Cantrell (Dennis.Cantrell@skofirm.com), and Janet Weile.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a discovery dispute/production timeline in Willaims, Ward & Moore v. Robinson, involving the Plaintiffs Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore, and Dewayne Ward (the client in this case), with discovery requests served by Naomi Robinson\u2019s team on June 9, 2025; thereafter, communications on July 15 and July 28, 2025 regarding status and the production of discovery materials, including a Dropbox-hosted document production.",

      "natural_language": "The case at issue is Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson, Floyd County docket 22D03-2501-CT-000157, a matter arising from a motor-vehicle collision on August 29, 2023. The file notes identify Dewayne Ward as the client of record for the presenting matter, with the overall caption listing plaintiffs Williams, Ward, and Moore against defendant Robinson. The correspondence in this note is from and among counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Stoll Keenon Ogden, with the recipient list including Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams (MVA 8/29/23), Dewayne Ward (MVA 8/29/23), Julmonzhae Moore (MVA 8/29/23), and Janet Weile. The messages bear standard confidentiality language typical of privileged attorney communications.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, W. Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Zach Reichle of Stoll Keenon Ogden (with several recipients cc\u2019d) attaching Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery along with the associated notice filed that day. A Word copy of the discovery was included for convenience, and Koon invited any questions regarding the materials.\n\nA little over a week later, on May 19, 2025, Zach Reichle requested a thirty-day extension to finalize Defendants\u2019 responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. He noted that the current due date was June 4, and that extending by thirty days would push the due date to July 7 (acknowledging that June 4 plus thirty days would land on July 4, and the following two days were the weekend).\n\nKoon responded later that same day, instructing that July 7 would be acceptable, and inviting Reichle to advise if anything else was needed. The exchange was accompanied by the standard confidentiality notices typical of these emails.\n\nSeveral months later, on October 17, 2025, Reichle wrote again, this time seeking to schedule the Plaintiffs\u2019 depositions and requesting their availability in November or December. He also noted a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and indicated that the parties had agreed to mediator Larry Church at the Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025. Reichle suggested that his office could contact Larry Church\u2019s office to determine availability. He added that the parties were booked throughout January and early February of the following year, so mediation would likely occur in late February or March. Reichle implied that this scheduling would not present an issue for the Court, given that the trial was not set to occur until December 2026, but he wanted to provide advance notice.\n\nOn October 22, 2025, Koon replied that his clients were available for depositions on any date during November 3\u20137, 2025, and asked to proceed with scheduling within that window. The message again carried the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nIn summary, the communications reflect discovery exchange and a requested extension in May 2025, followed by deposition scheduling efforts in October 2025, with a plan for Plaintiffs\u2019 depositions in early November 2025 and a mediation timeline extending into early 2026, all within the context of the ongoing Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson case arising from the August 29, 2023 motor-vehicle incident.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dewayne-Ward-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Dewayne Ward. The matter at hand is Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson, Floyd County case number 22D03-2501-CT-000157. The Whaley Law Firm, represented by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., was coordinating depositions for the plaintiffs\u2014Julmonzhae Moore, Ashlee Williams, and Dewayne Ward\u2014against defendant Robinson, with counsel for the defense at Skofirm, including Zachary Reichle, Esq., and colleagues such as Dennis Cantrell and Janet Weile. The deposition scheduling discussions ran through multiple emails across several months, with the CC list including Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA, Dewayne Ward MVA, Julmonzhae Moore MVA, and Janet Weile.\n\nThe thread began with communication in May 2025. On May 19, 2025, Bryce Koon indicated that July 7 would be fine for the depositions, and invited any additional needs. Janet Weile of Skofirm replied later that day, confirming with Moore and Williams that they were available on the 7th and noting that Moore works that afternoon, so starting with her would be preferable. Weile also mentioned that Ward would need to confirm his availability for 11/7 and promised to relay that information as soon as she heard back.\n\nIn mid-October 2025, Zachary Reichle inquired about the plaintiffs\u2019 availability for depositions in November or December, noting a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and proposing mediator Larry Church, whom the parties had previously discussed at a Case Management Conference on July 29, 2025. Reichle explained that the firm was booked through January and early February and anticipated mediation to occur in late February or March, a schedule they did not expect would create a problem with the Court given that trial was not set until December 2026.\n\nFollowing that, on October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon responded that his clients were available for depositions on any date from November 3 through November 7, and asked the defense to indicate which dates would work. A few days later, on October 24, 2025, Reichle replied that November 6 and 7 would work, and suggested scheduling all three depositions consecutively on November 7 from 9 a.m. to noon, with the option of separating them onto different days if necessary.\n\nOn October 29, 2025, at 1:43 p.m., Bryce Koon again wrote to confirm that Moore and Williams were available on November 7, and explained that Moore would likely be available only in the morning or early afternoon since she works that afternoon, so starting with her would be preferable. He also noted that Ward would need to confirm by the next day whether he could attend on 11/7, and he promised to relay Ward\u2019s availability as soon as he heard back.\n\nA short time later that same day, at 1:49 p.m., Zach Reichle responded that notices would be issued for Ms. Moore\u2019s deposition beginning at 9 a.m. on November 7, with Ms. Williams\u2019 deposition to follow at 11 a.m. Reichle also stated that Mr. Ward had availability the week of November 10 if November 7 did not work for him.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discussed the scheduling of depositions for the plaintiffs (Moore and Williams) and Mr. Ward, with a plan to proceed on November 7 for Moore and Williams and to address Ward\u2019s availability for the following week if needed. The communications also touched on judicial timing aspects such as the January 31, 2026 mediation deadline and the anticipated mediator (Larry Church), as well as the consideration that trial was not set until December 2026. The underlying case remains Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157), with the current objective being to finalize deposition dates for Moore, Williams, and Ward.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Dewayne-Ward-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Dewayne Ward. The file concerns Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson in Floyd County, Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157. The deposition scheduling discussions involve the plaintiffs\u2014Ashlee Williams (MVA 8/29/23), Dewayne Ward (MVA 8/29/23), and Julmonzhae Moore (MVA 8/29/23)\u2014and their counsel, with distribution to Dennis Cantrell and Janet Weile, and copies to the relevant Filevine project addresses for Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nThe correspondence begins in May 2025. On May 19, 2025, Zachary Reichle of Stoll Keenon Ogden asked counsel to consider an additional thirty days to finalize the defendants\u2019 responses to the plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, noting the current due date of June 4 and proposing July 7 as the new deadline. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm responded later that day, indicating that July 7 would be acceptable. Earlier messages in the thread (dated May 7 and related) indicate the parties were already working toward coordinating discovery responses and related schedules.\n\nMoving forward to October 2025, the parties shifted focus to scheduling depositions. On October 17, 2025, Zach Reichle sent an email asking for the plaintiffs\u2019 availability in November or December to schedule their depositions. He also reminded the recipients that there is a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026, and that the parties had previously agreed to Larry Church as mediator at the Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025. Reichle noted that the firm\u2019s calendar in January and early February next year is full, so mediation would likely occur in late February or March, but he acknowledged that this should not pose an issue for the court given that trial was not set until December 2026.\n\nOn October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon replied, stating that his clients are available for depositions on any date from November 3 through November 7, and asking Reichle to confirm which dates would work so they could be scheduled.\n\nA follow-up from October 24, 2025, confirmed that November 6 and 7 would work for Reichle\u2019s office. Reichle proposed scheduling all three depositions consecutively or, if preferable, holding them on separate days; he suggested a window of 9:00 a.m. to noon on November 7 if all three could be done in one morning, but he did not object to separate days if necessary.\n\nOn October 29, 2025, Bryce Koon responded. He stated that he had confirmed with Julmonzhae Moore and Ashlee Williams that they are available on November 7. He noted that Moore is expected to work that afternoon, so starting with Moore on November 7 would be ideal. He added that Mr. Ward told him he would let him know by the following day whether Ward would be available on November 7, and he promised to relay Ward\u2019s availability as soon as he heard back.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the participants\u2019 primary objective was to schedule the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions efficiently within the week of November 3\u20137, 2025, with a preference to begin with Julmonzhae Moore on the afternoon of November 7, followed by the other two plaintiffs, Dewayne Ward and Ashlee Williams, contingent on Ward\u2019s availability. The communications also indicate ongoing coordination regarding discovery deadlines and mediation scheduling, in the context of a case not set for trial until December 2026.\n\nSignatures and contact details appear at the end of the messages from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, including the office address in Louisville, KY, and the firm\u2019s phone and fax numbers. The emails also include standard confidentiality notices and recipient instructions customary to attorney communications. The attachments and filevine project addresses in the CC fields reference the plaintiffs\u2019 MVA matters and the associated case files.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Dewayne Ward\u2019s motor vehicle accident (Dewayne-Ward-MVA-8-29-2023), the latest activity shows a motor-vehicle-related deposition planning thread concerning the Moore and Williams depositions. On November 13, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, requesting dates for his client\u2019s deposition and noting that they would schedule Dewayne Ward\u2019s deposition for the same day once dates are set. The message was addressed to Reichle and cc\u2019d to Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23 Filevine project email, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023 Filevine project email, and Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023 Filevine project email. Koon signed with his firm\u2019s contact information and included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThe message stream traces back to November 6, 2025, with an exchange about arranging the depositions. At 11:54 AM, Bryce Koon asked Reichle and Dennis Cantrell for the Zoom link for the depos tomorrow, to ensure he had everything prepared for his clients. Reichle responded at 12:10 PM that the reporter had confirmed the depositions would proceed as scheduled and that a calendar invite with the Zoom link would be emailed shortly, which they would forward once available. At 12:15 PM, Reichle provided the Zoom details: a Join Zoom Meeting link (https://stewartrichardson.zoom.us/j/81627086306?pwd=beXeD9HWwYbPQ9aVXcVoZd4CnKxuFN.1), Meeting ID 816 2708 6306, and Passcode 462204, along with a note that the invite had been or would be forwarded. The email thread included Reichle\u2019s firm signature, a confidentiality notice, and standard firm boilerplate. Bryce Koon\u2019s earlier message also noted an image attached in the email that had been removed by the sender, and the messages contained the firm\u2019s contact information and the usual client-privilege warnings.",
