      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. The client is Juanita Nicole Downs, whose motor vehicle accident occurred on April 16, 2021, and who is involved in Allstate Claim 0625854435 alongside Destiny Atkins.\n\nIn a February 3, 2022 email, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm addressed Patrice Gaines at Allstate about the Allstate claim involving Destiny Atkins and Juanita Downs. He stated that he had attached letters of representation for both Juanita and Destiny, a photo of Juanita’s ankle from after surgery, and a bill labeled as a UL bill along with one UL file. He noted that the UL file he attached contains her discharge summary and injuries. He also indicated that Juanita had fractured one ankle and dislocated the other, and he asked, “How much is the policy?” An image file named “Juanita Downs RIGHT ANKLE.jpg” was attached as part of the correspondence.\n\nAllstate responded later that day, February 3, 2022 at 11:46 AM, with a message indicating that the file had been transferred to them for further handling. Patrice Gaines asked Aaron to forward a letter of representation and requested an update on the client’s injuries, treatment, and medical bills amount. The message was accompanied by Allstate’s confidentiality and privacy notices and referenced the unique Conversation ID FRdc7efdcd452944.\n\nThe email thread also contains an earlier exchange from January 4, 2022. In that exchange, Aaron Whaley told claims@claims.allstate.com, “Ashley, here is the report I mentioned. Let me know after you review it and speak to your insured.” Earlier that same day, Allstate, via Ashley Stuteville, replied to acknowledge the information and asked that Aaron send the information discussed so they could review it. The thread then includes Aaron’s signature listing Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville, Kentucky contact information.\n\nIn summary, the communications show an ongoing exchange regarding Allstate Claim 0625854435 for Juanita Downs (and Destiny Atkins), with January 2022 discussions about a report and requested materials, and a February 3, 2022 exchange where Aaron provided representation letters, medical attachments including a post-surgery ankle injury photo and UL-related documents, and Allstate’s request for representation documentation and an updated summary of injuries, treatments, and medical bills, along with policy amount inquiry.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. The client in this matter is Juanita Nicole Downs, and the proceedings concern Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, a series of email exchanges took place between The Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, regarding service of process in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter. In a message sent by Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (email to Brian D. Stempien, with A. Campbell Ewen and Aaron Whaley copied), she stated that while the question of whether service is “good” or not is not for her to decide, the service was listed as “Successful.” She noted that if Stempien’s office wished to file an Answer and later dispute the validity of service, that was their prerogative, but she would raise their concern for Aaron to address further. The message included Sarena’s contact information and reminded the recipient of her new email address.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:20 PM, Sarena Tuttle had written to Mr. Stempien (copied to A. Campbell Ewen and Aaron Whaley) thanking him for his letter dated 06/28/2022 stating that his firm represents Stephanie Nail at the request of Allstate. She indicated a willingness to discuss settlement at any point if an offer would be made; however, if settlement is not pursued, she noted, per CourtNet, that Stephanie Nail was served via Certified Mail on 06/15/2022. They looked forward to receiving the Answer on behalf of Mrs. Nail on or about July 15, 2022. She also invited discussion about settlement or any further needs, and attached the Interrogatories propounded upon the client along with the Complaint served on 06/15/2022. The message provided The Whaley Law Firm’s address, phone numbers, and email (including the new address) for future contact.\n\nIn response, at 2:25 PM on June 30, 2022, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, located in the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, wrote back. He asked what information the sender had to show that service was good, stating that, from what could be seen, the return of service referenced only COVID-19. He provided his office contact details, including Office: (502) 245-7474, Fax: (502) 245-7025, Toll Free: 1-866-431-3599, and E-Mail: bstempien@thattorneys.com, and included the standard attorney-Client disclaimer language, noting the material was Privileged and Confidential and that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving email with the firm. He also included the usual IRS Circular 230 warning language pertinent to tax advice communications.\n\nLater that same day, at 2:37 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle replied to Mr. Stempien. She stated that the question of whether service is “good” is not something she decides; the service is currently listed as “Successful.” If the opposing side wishes to file an Answer and then challenge the validity of service, that is their prerogative. However, she would note the concern for Aaron to address further. The message again provided her contact information and reminded that there is a new email address for future correspondence.\n\nSignatures and attachments referenced in these communications included: the Complaint served on 06/15/2022 and the Interrogatories propounded upon the client on 06/15/2022. The communications collectively reflect ongoing settlement discussions, the asserted method and timing of service (Certified Mail on 06/15/2022), and the parties’ positions regarding potential disputes to service validity.",

We are always more than happy to discuss settlement at any point if your office would like to make an offer. However, if not, moving forward, per CourtNet your client, Stephanie Nail was served via Certified Mail on 06/15/2022. We look forward to receiving your Answer on behalf of Mrs. Nail on or about July 15, 2022.\n If you would like to discuss settlement or need anything further, please feel free to contact us directly to discuss the claim in more detail.

      "natural_language": "This note concerns the case captioned Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, with the named client being Juanita Nicole Downs. The matter appears to involve a motor vehicle accident arising on April 16, 2021, and is logged under the case reference Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. The parties and counsel in the July 2022 email exchange include Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, and Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, with CCs to A. Campbell Ewen and Beth Alexander. The July 14, 2022 communication was sent from Stempien to Tuttle and Whaley, copied to the two additional names, and signed with full firm contact details and a standard attorney-privileged disclaimer.\n\nIn a June 30, 2022 email, Sarena M. Tuttle acknowledged service matters and noted that the firm is open to settlement discussions at any time. She stated that, per CourtNet, Stephanie Nail was served via Certified Mail on June 15, 2022, and she indicated that they expected an Answer on or about July 15, 2022. Tuttle attached the Interrogatories and the Complaint, both dated June 15, 2022, and invited further discussion if settlement was desired or if additional information was needed. The email also provided the law firm’s contact information and new email address for Ms. Tuttle.\n\nIn a subsequent reply dated July 14, 2022, Mr. Stempien addressed three points. First, he noted that the return attached to the electronic file on Courtnet contains the word “COVID” spelled out, and stated that, in his view, this is not effective service; he asked to be informed if the other side disagrees or plans to file a default motion. Second, he recalled that there had been a discussion about a 30-day extension of the time to Answer by agreement, and he requested confirmation on whether an extension through August 1 would be opposed. Third, he asked whether there is an intention to amend the Complaint, suggesting that they might wait to see what happens when any amended pleading is served on Ms. Nail. The email closed with Mr. Stempien’s contact information and the firm’s standard disclaimer regarding privileged communications, no attorney-client relationship, and tax-related disclosures under Circular 230.\n\nOverall, the exchange records a dispute over service validity (with reference to a Courtnet return noting the term “COVID”), a potential extension of time to answer through August 1, and questions about possibly amending the Complaint, all within the procedural posture of Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate as of mid-July 2022. The June 30, 2022 email also confirms that the Complaint and attached Interrogatories had been served on June 15, 2022, and that an Answer was anticipated around July 15, 2022.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nIn the matter of Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate, the note concerns a motor vehicle collision that occurred on April 16, 2021, involving Juanita Nicole Downs. The client for this matter is Juanita Nicole Downs. The Whaley Law Firm represents the plaintiffs, including Adkins and Downs, while the defendants are Stephanie Nail and Allstate, with Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC representing Nail and Allstate. The correspondence centers on service issues, potential extensions, and the possibility of amending the Complaint in CourtNet, with communications exchanged between the two firms and related counsel.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Brian Stempien (and copied A. Campbell Ewen and Aaron Whaley) regarding representation and settlement discussions. Tuttle thanked Stempien for his letter dated June 28, 2022, noting that Nail was being represented at Allstate’s request and that settlement discussions were welcome at any point if an offer could be made. She stated that, per CourtNet, Nail was served via Certified Mail on June 15, 2022, and that they looked forward to receiving Nail’s Answer on or about July 15, 2022. Tuttle attached the Interrogatories propounded on Nail along with the Complaint served on June 15, 2022, and invited further discussion if settlement needed to be pursued or if additional information was required.\n\nOn July 14, 2022 at 10:50 a.m., Brian Stempien replied to Aaron Whaley and Ms. Tuttle. He noted that the return attached to the Courtnet electronic file uses the word “COVID” spelled out, and he stated that, in his view, this did not constitute effective service. He asked to be informed if Whaley’s side disagreed or intended to file a motion for default. Stempien also referenced the earlier discussion about a 30-day extension of the time to Answer by agreement and asked whether the parties were opposed to extending the deadline through August 1. He also inquired whether there was an intention to move to amend the Complaint and suggested that they might wait to see what happens when service is attempted on Ms. Nail. The note ended with Stempien’s signature block and contact information, including his office address, telephone and fax numbers, email, and website, along with standard attorney-privilege disclaimers typical of such correspondence.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 11:02 a.m. on the same day, July 14, 2022, Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm responded. He stated that he had no objection to extending the deadline to August 1. He added that if Allstate were to extend coverage, he would have no objection to an indefinite extension while he attempted to resolve the claim with Allstate. This response indicated openness to a longer extension if necessary to pursue a resolution with Allstate. The email also carried the customary firm disclaimers, tax-related notices, and attorney-client privilege language typical of the correspondence in this matter.\n\nIn summary, the proximate issues discussed in these communications concerned the validity of Nail’s service, the potential extension of time to answer through August 1 (with openness to further extensions if Allstate extended coverage), whether to amend the Complaint, and ongoing settlement discussions or resolutions related to the Adkins & Downs v. Nail & Allstate case arising from the April 16, 2021 motor vehicle incident involving Juanita Nicole Downs.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita Nicole Downs MVA case, filed for a motor vehicle accident that occurred on April 16, 2021. The client is Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nIn the Re: Claim correspondence, on October 25, 2022 at 1:25 PM, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Juanita Downs at juanitadowns98@gmail.com and to Sarena Tuttle at sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, with a copy to JuanitaNicoleDownsMVAZ954678@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. He reported that service had finally been effected on the defendant and that the insurance company had filed an answer. He also stated that discovery would be sent soon to answer and that Sarena would work with the client on that process.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 11:14 AM, Juanita Downs wrote: “Hello I was reaching out in regards to my suit and the process of it if you can get back with me at your earliest convenience I would greatly appreciate it.” The message was sent from her iPhone.\n\nLooking back to prior messages in July 2022, on July 19, 2022 at 1:03 PM, Juanita Downs asked: “Alright how is everything looking so far?” This message was also sent from her iPhone.\n\nOn July 18, 2022, a series of exchanges occurred. At 2:53 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote: “No, you do not.” In response, at 2:51 PM, Juanita Downs asked: “Do I need to make an appearance at court anytime?” Aaron Whaley replied at 2:49 PM: “IT has been filed and I am fighting in Court.” Earlier, at 2:31 PM on the same day, Juanita wrote: “Hey my name is Juanita Downs I was wondering if there’s any progress being made in my case that had to be taken to court I haven’t heard from anyone I’m probably a month or 2.” The exchanges continued through these timestamps, with signatures from Aaron Whaley and the Whaley Law Firm listed at the end of the messages, including the firm’s address and phone number.\n\nThe correspondence reflects ongoing litigation activity: service of the defendant completed, the insurer’s answer filed, and forthcoming discovery with Sarena Tuttle assisting the client. The record also shows repeated client inquiries about case progress and court appearances, and interim attorney updates indicating the case has been filed and is being fought in court. The communication concludes with the standard firm signature block for Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.",

She noted, per associate general counsel, that Nationwide continues to exercise the option afforded carriers under Medlin v Progressive to require proof of payment to providers in order to honor a direction to pay to either claimants or their attorney. Freeman concluded by saying she looks forward to hearing from them soon.\n\nFor reference, the message includes Freeman’s signature and contact details: Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, Claims Specialist III, Medical, P.O. Box 26005, Daphne, AL 36526-5005; Work phone 352-261-6233; Fax 877-590-8188; FREEMAB2@nationwide.com. It also contains the standard fraud disclaimer: “Any person who knowingly and with intent to defraud any insurance company or other person files a statement of claim containing any materially false information or conceals, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto commits a fraudulent insurance act, which is a crime.”",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nOn January 16, 2023, a forwarding email was sent in the matter titled Downs and Adkins v. Nail, et al. from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle and to Juanita Nicole Downs (identified as MVA 4/16/2021). The subject line of the forwarded message was the case name. In the body of the email, Aaron asked, “Where are we on getting answers? I know client has been in touch.” This message was itself a forward of prior correspondence.\n\nThe forwarded content included a January 16, 2023, 5:25 PM message from Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC. In that message, Stempien wrote that he was still working on discovery and was under pressure to file a motion if the client’s responses were not received soon. He proposed deposition dates for the clients on January 24, January 25, January 30, or February 3, and he signed with the firm’s name and contact information: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243. His office phone was (502) 245-7474, fax (502) 245-7025, toll-free (866) 431-3599, and his email was bstempien@thattorneys.com. He also provided the firm’s website, http://www.thslaw.co. The message included the customary Privileged and Confidential disclaimer, noting that the information was attorney-privileged and confidential, intended for the named recipient, and that dissemination or copying was prohibited if the reader was not the intended recipient. It also carried a “No Attorney-Client Relationship” disclaimer, stating that sending or receiving email did not establish an attorney-client relationship, and it repeated the IRS Circular 230 tax-advice notices applicable to tax communications.\n\nWithin the same forwarded thread, there is an earlier message dated Friday, December 23, 2022, from Brian Stempien to Aaron Whaley, with Beth Alexander and A. Campbell Ewen CC’d, subject “Downs and Adkins v. Nail, et al.” In that December 23 message, Stempien extended Christmas wishes and explained that they were still working on responses to discovery that had been sent to Ms. Nail along with the Complaint. He noted that he expected the discovery responses from their side within the next few weeks. He also requested that Aaron have his office work with Beth to get the depositions of their clients on the books, ideally in January. He invited questions and wished Aaron and his family a great Christmas. The closing included Brian D. Stempien’s name and the same firm contact details as above, followed again by the Privileged and Confidential disclaimer and the No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer, as well as the IRS Circular 230 tax-advice warning. The December 23 message was part of the same email thread and included Brian’s signature block listing the firm’s address in Middletown, Louisville, KY, the same office phone and fax numbers, toll-free number, and email bstempien@thattorneys.com, along with the website and the standard disclaimers.\n\nThe December 23, 2022 message was preceded by the “From: Brian Stempien, Sent: Friday, December 23, 2022 1:15 PM” header and included the full content described above. It was followed by the standard firm disclaimers, and the message also contained the sender’s and recipient’s email addresses and the firm’s physical address as noted. The content within this chain repeatedly references discovery responses, the Ms. Nail discovery, and scheduling depositions for January, alongside the ongoing discovery work and the expectation of client responses.\n\nIn summary, the communication record shows ongoing discovery work and scheduling discussions for the Downs and Adkins v. Nail matter, with Juanita Nicole Downs as the client, connected to a motor vehicle accident case from 4/16/2021. The timeline includes a December 23, 2022 email urging production of discovery responses and deposition scheduling, and a January 16, 2023 email indicating continued efforts on discovery and proposing deposition dates (January 24, 25, 30, or February 3), all within an email thread that carries the standard attorney-privilege notices, no attorney-client relationship disclaimers, and tax-related Circular 230 notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. The following notes document a chain of attorney communications related to the matter Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate, which is occurring alongside the underlying motor vehicle accident (MVA) case from April 16, 2021.\n\nOn April 21, 2023, a forward was sent from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle regarding Adkins & Downs v Nail & Allstate. The subject line of the forwarded message was “Fwd: Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate.” In the forwarded content, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC wrote that his carrier was pressing him to file a motion to compel and asked for updates on deposition dates and discovery. The message included the law firm’s contact information: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, in the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, with office phone (502) 245-7474, fax (502) 245-7025, toll-free (866) 431-3599, and email bstempien@thattorneys.com. The firm’s website was listed as http://www.thslaw.co. The message contained standard privileged and confidential notices asserting attorney-client privilege, stating that the information was intended for the named recipient and that dissemination or copying if received in error was prohibited, along with notices about no attorney-client relationship and related IRS Circular 230 tax disclosures.\n\nThe chain then included earlier correspondence. In a message from Brian Stempien to Aaron Whaley (dated April 21, 2023, around 2:09 PM), Stempien reiterated that his carrier was pushing for a motion to compel and requested information on deposition dates and discovery. This message was accompanied by the same firm signature block and confidentiality notices.\n\nEarlier in the thread, in a March 22, 2023 email from Aaron Whaley to Brian Stempien, Whaley stated that they were working on completing the discovery responses and noted a “little confusion” between himself and Sarena Tuttle. He mentioned that he had assigned Sarena Tuttle a task to redo service due to a prior objection raised by Stempien.\n\nPrior to that, on March 21, 2023 (the email dated around 5:02 PM), Brian Stempien wrote explaining his questions about when they could expect the client’s discovery responses and dates for the deposition. He also noted that there had been a peculiar filing of the complaint again in the case and asked whether this was intentional or if there was anything else missing. He emphasized that they were working to close the loop on Ms. Nail’s discovery and that obtaining the client’s responses and her deposition should be the first priority.\n\nThe chain includes earlier correspondence from July 14, 2022. In a message from Aaron Whaley dated July 14, 2022 at 11:03 AM, Whaley indicated that he did not object to an extension to August 1, and that if Allstate extended coverage, he would not object to an indefinite extension while attempting to resolve the claim with Allstate. This message was sent to Brian Stempien, with Sarena Tuttle copied, and also included A. Campbell Ewen (ACEwen@ewenandkinney.com) and Beth Alexander. The subject line was “Re: Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate,” and the message carried the standard privileged and confidential notices.\n\nEarlier still, on July 14, 2022, at 10:50 AM, Brian Stempien had written a request to Aaron and Ms. Tuttle. He noted an issue with service, explaining that the return attached to the Courtnet electronic file spelled out as “COVID,” which he stated did not constitute effective service, and he asked to be advised if they disagreed or intended to file a motion for default. He also reminded that there had been a discussion about a 30-day extension of the time to answer by agreement, and asked to know whether there was opposition to extending through August 1. Finally, he asked whether there was an intention to move to amend the Complaint, suggesting they wait to see what happens when attempting to serve that on Ms. Nail. The message included the same firm details and legal/disclaimer notices as above.\n\nOverall, the record shows a back-and-forth concerning discovery responses, deposition dates, service issues, potential amendments to the Complaint, and extensions of deadlines, across communications dated July 2022 through April 2023. The communications involved Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), Sarena Tuttle, Brian D. Stempien (Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC), Beth Alexander, and A. Campbell Ewen, among others, and were governed by standard attorney-client privilege notices, confidentiality declarations, and related IRS Circular 230 disclosures. The case at hand remains the Adkins & Downs v. Stephanie Nail & Allstate matter, connected to the underlying MVA case from April 16, 2021, with the client identified as Juanita Nicole Downs.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita Nicole Downs MVA, filed 4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nIn the matter of Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, communications between the Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC trace the ongoing discovery and deposition scheduling discussions. The most recent thread begins with an email dated April 24, 2023, in which Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm apologizes for a delay and attaches the Plaintiff’s Responses to the opposing party’s discovery requests. She notes that the Plaintiff’s Responses are attached and asks whether counsel and their client are available for depositions on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, and indicates that deposition format can be via Zoom or at the opposing counsel’s office. The attachments listed in that email are three documents dated 2023-04-18: “Adkins & Downs NOS Resp to DC Disc R...,” “Adkins Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf,” and “Downs Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf.”\n\nThe email chain shows a longer history of discovery and scheduling communications beginning in 2022 and continuing into 2023. On July 14, 2022, Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley discussed extending deadlines, with Aaron indicating no objection to extending the time to August 1 if Allstate would also extend, while noting issues with service and a related discussion about whether a 30-day extension of the time to answer had been agreed. Brian had raised concerns about service in that period, including references to a Courtnet filing that spelled out the word “COVID,” and he noted the possibility of seeking an extension by agreement.\n\nEarlier, on March 21, 2023, Brian asked Aaron when he could expect the client’s discovery responses and dates for the depositions, and he commented on a “peculiar filing of the complaint again today” in the case. He stated that they were working to close the loop on Ms. Nail’s discovery but that obtaining the client’s responses and her deposition on the books should be their first priority. The following day, March 22, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied that they were working on finishing the responses and mentioned a minor disagreement between himself and Sarena Tuttle, noting that he had assigned Sarena a task to redo service due to a prior objection.\n\nThen, on April 21, 2023, a forwarded message from Brian Stempien indicates that his carrier is pressing him to file a motion to compel and asks for confirmation of deposition dates and discovery, reinforcing that the parties were actively moving toward depositions and discovery scrutiny. Finally, on April 24, 2023, Sarena Tuttle responded with an apology for the delay and provided the Plaintiff’s Discovery responses, along with proposed deposition dates (May 23, 25, 30, or June 1) and the option to conduct them via Zoom or in the opposing counsel’s office. The email also includes standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality notices along with “No Attorney-Client Relationship” disclaimers and a Circular 230 tax disclosure warning typical of the firm’s communications.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the subject matter remained the Adkins & Downs v. Nail & Allstate case, the Plaintiffs’ discovery responses, and scheduling for depositions, with multiple attachments and several rounds of communications between the Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC. The note also preserves the presence of the Whaley firm’s contacts and standard disclaimer language typical of their emails.",

Aaron mentioned that he had asked Sarena to redo service due to a prior objection.\n\nOn March 21, 2023, Brian Stempien had sent a message to Aaron Whaley inquiring when the client’s discovery responses and deposition dates could be expected. He also mentioned receiving a peculiar filing of the complaint again that day and asked whether it was intentional or if something was missing. He stated that they were trying to close the loop on Stephanie Nail’s discovery but that obtaining the client’s responses and her deposition on the books was their first priority. This message also carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the messages consistently reference the Adkins & Downs v Nail & Allstate case, with depositions being scheduled and discovery responses being prepared or awaited. The communication threads reveal a focus on setting June deposition dates (and May options) and on advancing discovery in tandem with negotiations and motions such as a potential motion to compel, as indicated by Brian Stempien’s April 21, 2023 note. The attachments referenced in the April 24, 2023 email indicate that Plaintiff’s discovery responses were provided for review, and the conversation includes the routine disclaimers about privilege, confidentiality, and the non-establishment of an attorney-client relationship.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. The client is Juanita Nicole Downs, whose motor vehicle accident occurred on April 16, 2021, and the matter captioned Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate is being pursued.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Beth Alexander with Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley copied. In the message, she stated that their office was available for depositions on June 20, 22, 27, or 29, and that they would like to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day, anticipating that the depositions of all three parties would require a full day. The email included Sarena’s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on June 2, 2023, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, wrote to Aaron Whaley and Sarena, requesting that the depositions of their clients be scheduled in June if possible and asking them to contact Beth Alexander regarding available dates. Brian provided his firm’s contact details: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; office 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; toll-free 1-866-431-3599; email bstempien@thattorneys.com; website www.thslaw.co. The message included the standard attorney-privilege and confidentiality disclaimer, noted that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and carried the IRS/Circular 230 warning about tax-related disclosures.\n\nThe June 2 message sits within a longer email chain that includes earlier exchanges. In a June 2 reply, the recipients were asked to coordinate deposition dates with Beth and to advance scheduling. The thread also contains a forwarded excerpt from Brian’s June 2 message showing that he had asked Aaron and Sarena to set depositions in June and to contact Beth regarding dates.\n\nIn the prior portion of the thread, on April 24, 2023, Sarena Tuttle responded to Brian Stempien, apologizing for delays and noting that Plaintiff’s Discovery Responses were attached. She asked whether he and his client were available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, and stated that depositions could be conducted either via Zoom or in Beth Alexander’s office. Her signature again listed her role and contact details at The Whaley Law Firm, including the newly noted email address, and the message referenced attachments labeled as NOS Resp to DC Disc R and Final PDFs for Adkins Resp to Disc Req and Downs Resp to Disc Req.\n\nEarlier still, on April 21, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied to Brian, explaining that they were working on finishing the discovery responses and noting a bit of confusion between Aaron and Sarena, mentioning that he had asked Sarena to redo a service after a prior objection. This followed Brian Stempien’s earlier inquiry on April 21, 2023, 2:09 PM, asking when his colleague could expect the client’s discovery response and indicating pressure from his carrier to file a motion to compel. Brian’s contact details and firm information were included in that message as well, along with the standard confidentiality and privilege warnings.\n\nFinally, in a prior exchange from March 21, 2023, Brian Stempien had asked Aaron Whaley when the discovery responses could be expected. Aaron replied on March 22, 2023, indicating that they were working on finishing the responses and noting a small amount of confusion with Sarena, mentioning that he had tasked Sarena with redoing service due to a prior objection.\n\nIn summary, the case notes reflect a string of communications among the parties and counsel regarding scheduling depositions (notably seeking to depose Mrs. Nail on the same day as the other depositions, potentially occupying a full day for all three), as well as ongoing discovery responses and related administrative matters, with multiple dates proposed across April, May, and June 2023 and standard confidentiality and privilege language interspersed throughout the correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, in connection with a motor vehicle accident case involving Juanita Nicole Downs (file name: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021; client: Juanita Nicole Downs). The notes trace the ongoing discussion about scheduling depositions in June 2023 and the related discovery materials.\n\nThe earliest referenced thread in this note is an email chain starting April 21, 2023. In that message, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, writing to Aaron Whaley and with Sarena Tuttle copied, indicates that his carrier is pressuring him to file a motion to compel. He asks to be informed about deposition dates and discovery, and asks that the recipients let him know about the available deposition dates and discovery timeline.\n\nOn April 24, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Brian, apologizing for the delay. She states that the plaintiff’s responses to discovery are attached and asks whether Brian and his client are available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, with the option to conduct depositions via Zoom or in Brian’s office. She notes that attachments include the plaintiff’s discovery responses, specifically files named 2023.04.18 Adkins NOS Resp to DC Disc R..., 2023.04.18 Adkins Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf, and 2023.04.18 Downs Resp to Disc Req - Final.pdf. This message also contains Sarena’s standard signature block, including her contact information and a reminder that the email is sent with confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on June 2, 2023, Brian Stempien sent a message to Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle asking to set the depositions of their clients in June if possible and requesting that Beth Alexander be contacted regarding dates. He also asked Aaron to call him when he had a moment.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Sarena Tuttle replied to Beth Alexander and Brian, indicating that her office has availability for depositions on June 20, June 22, June 27, or June 29, and that they would like to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day, anticipating that all three depositions would require a full day. This message includes Sarena’s standard contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nLater on June 6, 2023, Beth Alexander, the paralegal to Brian Stempien, replied to Sarena. Beth notes that June 29 appears to be the only date among the proposed options on which Brian is available for two depositions; she states that Brian will not agree to conduct three depositions in one day. She asks whether Sarena can propose dates for the following week to schedule Ms. Nail’s deposition at their office. Beth provides her full professional contact information and includes a standard Privileged and Confidential disclaimer, a No Attorney-Client Relationship statement, and IRS Circular 230 disclosures about tax-related communications. The message also references an image attachment (cid:image001.jpg@01D99870.4AD19AB0).\n\nThroughout these communications, standard disclaimers accompany each message. They note that the communications are attorney-privileged and confidential, intended only for the named recipient, and that any dissemination or copying by unintended recipients is prohibited. They also reiterate that sending or receiving email does not establish an attorney-client relationship, and they include the usual IRS Circular 230 warnings when tax advice is involved.\n\nIn summary, the notes document a coordinated effort among counsel to schedule depositions for Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate during June 2023, with a preference from The Whaley Law Firm to have Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day as the others (anticipating a full day for all three depositions) but with Brian Stempien indicating that three depositions in a single day would not be acceptable. The correspondence also reflects ongoing discovery activity from April 2023, including plaintiff discovery responses and the related scheduling discussions. The communications include multiple attachments and standard confidentiality and privilege notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nRe: Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate\n\nThe following narrative summarizes the email communications in June 2023 between the attorneys and staff handling the Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate matter, in which Juanita Nicole Downs is the client. The Whaley Law Firm represents the plaintiffs, and contact details for the key participants are included where cited.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, at 12:23 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address) sent an email to Beth Alexander (Paralegal to Brian Stempien, Travis Herbert & Stempien, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, KY 40243; Ph: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025) and cc’d Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley. In her message, Sarena acknowledged that “3 is a lot in a day” for depositions and suggested scheduling options around the upcoming Fourth of July week: the following week could accommodate the 6th, or the week after that offered the 11th or 12th. She also provided her contact details and reiterated her new email address.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 12:09 PM, Beth Alexander replied. She noted that June 29 is the only date among the proposed options when Brian is available for two depositions, and that Brian will not agree to three depositions in a single day. Beth asked if Sarena could propose dates for the following week so that Ms. Nail’s deposition could be set at their office. Beth’s signature followed, including her role as Paralegal to Brian Stempien and her firm information, along with standard privileged/Confidentiality notices and the usual attorney disclaimer language.\n\nIn a prior email thread dated June 6, 2023 at 10:51 AM, Sarena sent a message to Beth (cc’ing Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley) stating that their office was available for depositions on June 20, 22, 27, or 29. The plan was to take Mrs. Nail’s deposition on the same day as the other depositions, with the expectation that it would take a full day to complete all three depositions. Sarena again included her contact details and noted her new email address.\n\nThis June 6 exchange followed earlier correspondence. On June 2, 2023, Brian Stempien wrote to Aaron and Sarena, asking them to try to set the plaintiffs’ depositions in June if possible and to contact Beth regarding dates. He also requested that Aaron give him a call on the matter. Brian’s message was signed with his Travis Herbert & Stempien contact information and included the firm’s standard privilege and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAdditionally, on April 24, 2023 at 11:36 AM, Sarena sent an earlier note to Brian Stempien (cc: Aaron Whaley) apologizing for delays and attaching the Plaintiffs’ Responses to Defendants’ Discovery Requests. She indicated the depositions were flexible and asked whether Brian and his client were available on May 23, 25, 30, or June 1, with the option to conduct the depositions either via Zoom or in Brian’s office. She referenced attached documents (NOS Resp to DC Disc Req; Adkins Resp to Disc Req – Final; Downs Resp to Disc Req – Final) though the images themselves appear as embedded attachments in the email thread. As with the subsequent messages, Sarena closed with her Whaley Law Firm contact details and noted the new email address, alongside the standard Privileged and Confidential notices.\n\nIn addition to the substantive content, the emails consistently included the firm’s standard disclaimers: Privileged and Confidential; No Attorney-Client Relationship; instructions not to disseminate or copy if the recipient was not the intended one; and, where applicable, a Tax Regulations (Circular 230) warning about the reliability of any tax-related advice contained in the message.\n\nOverall, the thread documents coordinated scheduling efforts for depositions in Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, with proposed June dates (20, 22, 27, or 29) and a plan to depose Mrs. Nail on the same day as the other two depositions, resulting in a full day for the three depositions. The parties exchanged availability and constraints (notably Brian’s limit of two depositions per day and his preference against three in one day) and iterated potential dates around the June calendar and the upcoming holiday week.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. The packet documents correspondence related to the matter Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, consisting of a chain of emails between Beth A. Alexander, paralegal to Brian Stempien at Travis Herbert & Stempien, and Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe central topic across the emails is a deposition of Mrs. Nail in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail & Allstate matter, with the deposition notice setting July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM to be held at the recipient’s office, as agreed. The parties discussed whether the deposition would be conducted in person or via Zoom, with the Whaley Law Firm indicating a preference for Zoom but a willingness to proceed at the other firm’s office.\n\nThe chronology begins on June 6, 2023. At 12:39 PM, Sarena wrote to Beth, “Awesome. Thank you as well. I will get our notice over to you as soon as possible.” At 12:40 PM, Beth asked, “Plaintiff’s depos at your office or ours?” At 12:42 PM, Sarena replied, “We prefer Zoom, but we can do your office.” Beth responded at 12:43 PM, “Great….thanks.” Later that same day, at 1:39 PM, Sarena sent the formal deposition notice: “Here is our Notice to Take Deposition of Mrs. Nail on July 12, 2023 starting at 2:00p in your office as agreed.” The exchange closes with the confirming note from Sarena reiterated in the message of June 6, 2023.\n\nOn June 6, 2023 at 12:39 PM (in a corresponding thread), Beth again acknowledged and referenced the notice process with the same party’s contact details in her signature. The communications include standard confidentiality and privilege notices common to attorney communications, stating that the messages are attorney-privileged and confidential and that there is no attorney‑client relationship established by sending or receiving the e-mails. Each message also contains the IRS Circular 230 warning regarding tax advice, noting that the sender is complying with regulatory requirements and that the document may not contain all required disclosures.\n\nA subsequent development occurred on July 11, 2023. At 15:43:37 UTC, Beth emailed Sarena to report that they had been unable to reach Ms. Nail to confirm the deposition for tomorrow and that Brian is confident she will not appear; they had not been able to locate Ms. Nail since their initial conversation. Beth added that if her status changes, she would inform Sarena.\n\nIn summary, the depositions were planned for July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM at the recipient’s office, with Zoom as a preferred option though in-person deposition at the office was acceptable. The communications reveal attempts to locate Ms. Nail and to confirm her attendance, with a firm belief by counsel that she may not attend. The emails include the standard privileged/confidential notices and the Circular 230 tax disclosures typical of this law firm correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. This note pertains to the matter Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, The Whaley Law Firm sent a Notice to Take Deposition of Mrs. Nail (Stephanie Nail) for July 12, 2023, starting at 2:00 p.m., to be held in the recipient’s office as agreed. The notice was from Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines were D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to please use the new email address. The message also included the standard practice signatures and notices typical of attorney communications, indicating Privileged and Confidential information, No Attorney-Client Relationship, and various disclaimers about inadvertent receipt, as well as a Circular 230 warning related to tax communications.\n\nIn the email thread, Beth A. Alexander, Paralegal to Brian Stempien at Travis Herbert & Stempien, responded from Louisville, KY, indicating that the plaintiff’s deposition could be held at either party’s office. The thread shows prior exchange noting a preference for Zoom, but the offices could accommodate if needed. Beth’s location details included the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, KY 40243, with contact numbers Ph: (502) 245-7474 and Fax: (502) 245-7025. The earlier messages also carried the standard Privileged and Confidential notices and the No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer, as well as the IRS Circular 230 warning about tax advice.\n\nSarena’s June 6, 2023 email explicitly stated, “Here is our Notice to Take Deposition of Mrs. Nail on July 12, 2023 starting at 2:00 p in your office as agreed.” Her signature again listed her Whaley Law Firm contact details and reminded recipients of the new email address.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, Beth Alexander replied, “Great….thanks,” in response to the scheduling of the deposition. The thread reiterates the exchange regarding deposition location, with Beth asking whether the deposition would be at the plaintiff’s office or the defense office, and Sarena indicating a preference for Zoom but confirming the office option.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, Beth Alexander sent another update, stating that they had been unable to reach Ms. Nail to confirm the deposition for tomorrow and that Brian believed she would not show. She noted they had not been able to locate Ms. Nail since their initial conversation and that, if her status changed, she would let Sarena know.\n\nIn response to Beth’s July 11 message, Sarena Tuttle replied on July 11, 2023 at 12:05 p.m., writing, “Ok, thanks for the update. I will let Aaron & Bryce know as well.” This reply was sent from Sarena’s Whaley Law Firm inbox, with the message including her standard contact information and the reminder to use the new email address.\n\nThese communications also reflect the broader case context: Adkins & Downs v Stephanie Nail & Allstate, involving the client Juanita Nicole Downs, with the underlying matter related to a motor vehicle accident dated April 16, 2021. The deposition in question concerns the deposition of Mrs. Nail and was scheduled for July 12, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. in the agreed-upon location, with ongoing notes about whether the deposition would proceed given Nail’s availability.",

      "natural_language": "The case Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021 involves client Juanita Nicole Downs, with the matter styled as Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al. A deposition was scheduled for July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM, in Louisville, Kentucky, at the Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street. The deposition was to be conducted for the case number 84274, with Aaron Whaley, Esquire of The Whaley Law Firm listed as the client on the scheduling notice. The location was to be covered by Kentuckiana Court Reporters, located at 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202, with contact information P: 502-589-2273, F: 502-584-0119, E: Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com.\n\nOn July 11, 2023, Kristina Wenninger, Scheduling Manager at Kentuckiana Court Reporters, sent the confirmation for tomorrow’s proceeding, outlining the date 7/12/2023, time 2:00 PM, and the case details. The notice indicated Aaron Whaley, Esquire, The Whaley Law Firm as the client, the case style, and the location, and marked the Court Reporter box as checked; the other services (Videographer, Interpreter, Conference Room, ZOOM Connection, Telephone Conference) were not selected. The message was part of the exchange confirming the deposition.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 11:41 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied that they were still on for tomorrow and that, as far as she was aware, there had been no cancellations. She provided her contact information and noted her new email address. Shortly after, at 12:09 PM, she followed up that the Defense had, in fact, canceled the deposition, apologizing for the late change.\n\nIn the same thread, the message from Sarena’s later reply stated that the Defense did cancel the deposition after her previous response. The email signatures included her title and the firm’s contact details, with a note to please use the new email address. The confidentiality notice typical to her communications followed, indicating the content was intended for the addressee, may be privileged, and should not be filed publicly; it also contained standard restrictions on disclosure under applicable law.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nThis note covers a deposition confirmation attempt for July 12, 2023 (84274) in the matter Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al. The deposition was to be scheduled for 2:00 PM on 7/12/2023, with Aaron Whaley, Esquire of The Whaley Law Firm listed as the client on the scheduling confirmation. The case style identifies Stephanie Nail as the judge/witness, and the deposition location was to be at Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky, phone 502-245-7474. The record also lists Destiny Adkins alongside Juanita Downs as the plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 11, 2023 at 4:10:29 PM UTC, Kristina Wenninger, Scheduling Manager at Kentuckiana Court Reporters, wrote to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (cc’d Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley) stating that there was no problem with the deposition and that she would remove it from their calendar and later send cancellation confirmation. The message was signed by “McKenna,” the Scheduling Assistant, with contact information for Kentuckiana Court Reporters provided: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-589-2273; fax 502-584-0119; email Schedule@kentuckianareporters.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, on July 11, 2023, at 11:34 AM, Kristina Wenninger sent an email attaching the confirmation for the proceeding scheduled for tomorrow and asked to review and confirm whether it should proceed as scheduled or if revisions were needed. The draft confirmation included checkboxes, with [X] Court Reporter selected and the other options—Videographer, Interpreter, Conference Room, ZOOM Connection, and Telephone Conference—left unchecked.\n\nAt 11:41 AM, July 11, 2023, Sarena Tuttle replied: “Good afternoon, We are still on for tomorrow. As far as I’m aware there have not been any cancellations.” Her signature identifies her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with office address 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nMoments after that, at 12:09 PM, July 11, 2023, Sarena Tuttle sent another message: “Unfortunately, just moments after responding the Defense did in fact cancel the deposition. My apologies.” The message included her updated contact details (again noting the new email address).\n\nIn the thread, there are additional confirmations from Kristina Wenninger dated July 11, 2023, including a reply of “Thank you!” with a small image attachment, followed by the standard Kentuckiana Court Reporters signature block listing their office address, phone, fax, and email.\n\nThe deposition confirmation content that was circulating on July 11, 2023 also stated the scheduled date and time as 7/12/2023 at 2:00 PM, for the client Aaron Whaley, Esquire, of The Whaley Law Firm, in the case of Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al. The listed location remained Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Louisville, Kentucky, with the contact number 502-245-7474.\n\nThe email chain concludes with the standard confidentiality notice that accompanies these scheduling communications, noting that the information is intended for the addressee and may be privileged or confidential, and advising against filing copies publicly. It also states that if you are not the intended recipient, dissemination or copying is strictly prohibited.\n\nIn summary: The deposition for Destiny Adkins & Juanita Downs v. Stephanie Nail, et al. was scheduled for July 12, 2023 at 2:00 PM with Aaron Whaley, Esquire as the client, and the planned location was 11507 Main Street in Louisville. The defense canceled the deposition just after the confirmation discussions occurred on July 11, 2023, leading to cancellation of the proceeding. All relevant contact details for Kentuckiana Court Reporters and The Whaley Law Firm are as listed above, including the note about a new email address for Sarena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021, involving client Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nOn September 29, 2023, at 9:47:48 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Juanita Downs regarding the process of settlement. The subject was Re: Process of settlement. In the message, Sarena explained that she was a bit confused about who had told Juanita the case was settled. She reminded Juanita that, during a conversation on August 24, 2023, she advised that the team was still attempting to take the deposition of the owner of the vehicle. At that time, a Motion to Compel the Deposition had been filed and the Defendant had been ordered to appear for a deposition within 30 days. As of that date, the Defendant had not appeared or been produced for the deposition. Bryce, an attorney with The Whaley Law Firm, had followed up on the order and had filed a Motion for Sanctions and a Default Judgment earlier in the week. Sarena explained that sanctions are penalties for not following a court order and that a Default Judgment is an order ruling in Juanita’s favor. The team was awaiting the Judge’s approval or objection to those motions. She closed by inviting Juanita to contact the firm directly if she had any further questions to discuss the matter in more detail. The email signature identified Sarena as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s address listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. It provided direct and office phone numbers (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104) and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the note “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nEarlier, on September 28, 2023, at around 6:49 p.m., Juanita Downs wrote to the firm (from her iPhone) regarding her settlement. She stated that it had been over 30 days—the period she had been told they needed to settle—and that she had not heard anything from anyone and would like an update.\n\nIn summary, the client has been kept informed that the deposition of the vehicle owner was pursued via a Motion to Compel, with a court-ordered appearance within 30 days that had not yet occurred, and that sanctions and a possible Default Judgment were being sought, with the matter awaiting the Judge’s decision. Concurrently, Juanita requested an update on the settlement timeline, noting the 30-day expectation had passed.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nProcess of settlement.\n\nThe file indicates that on September 28, 2023, Juanita Downs emailed The Whaley Law Firm from her iPhone to express concern about her settlement in the motor vehicle accident matter and to request an update. She stated that it had been over 30 days since she had been told a decision would be reached and that she had not heard from anyone, asking for an update.\n\nThe following day, September 29, 2023, at approximately 12:10 PM (the note shows 12:10?PM), Juanita wrote again requesting that Aaron or Bryce call her, noting that she had called a month earlier and had been told there had been no effort to contact her or her attorney and that the firm was pursuing a settlement.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 9:47 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Juanita. She expressed that she was a bit confused about who had told Juanita that her case was settled. Sarena then recapped the status discussed during their August 24, 2023 conversation, explaining that they were still attempting to obtain the deposition of the owner of the vehicle. At that time, they had filed a Motion to Compel the deposition, and the defendant had been ordered to appear for a deposition within 30 days. The defendant had not appeared or been produced to date. She also noted that Bryce, an attorney with their office, had followed up on the order and had filed a Motion for Sanctions and a Default Judgment earlier in the week. Sarena clarified that sanctions are penalties for not following a court order and that a Default Judgment is an order ruling in Juanita’s favor. She added that they were awaiting the judge’s approval or objection to those motions and invited Juanita to contact them directly to discuss the matter in more detail. The communication included Sarena’s contact information and her role, along with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the direct lines: D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the note to please use the new email address.\n\nLater on September 29, 2023 at 12:12:29 PM, Sarena again sent a note stating, “I will forward your request to Aaron & Bryce,” reaffirming the plan to route Juanita’s request to the appropriate attorneys. The note also included Sarena’s professional signature with the same contact information and updated email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. This note captures an email exchange among counsel regarding the matter Adkins and Downs v. Nail, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court docket number 22-CI-002878, in connection with the Juanita Downs motor vehicle accident case.\n\nThe earliest item in the thread, dated September 28, 2023, comes from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm. In that message to opposing counsel, he requested that they review the attached filing that had been filed that day in Jefferson Circuit Court. His signature block lists The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information, followed by the standard confidential and privilege notices typical of attorney communications, including warnings about attorney-client privilege, the prohibition on dispersion if received in error, and instructions to contact the sender and delete the message if it was sent to the wrong recipient. The email also includes a standard disclaimer about not creating an attorney-client relationship by email, and a Circular 230 tax disclosure stating that the document may not contain complete tax disclosures and that tax advice should not be relied upon for penalties or used in marketing materials.\n\nOn October 7, 2023, Brian D. Stempien, of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, replied to Bryce Koon, indicating that they had located Ms. Nail and asking whether Wednesday, October 18 at 2:00 p.m. in their office would work for him. Stempien closed with his firm’s contact details, and the message was marked as sent from an iPhone. The message body did not include new attachments but set the schedule inquiry for a meeting.\n\nOn October 9, 2023, at 11:16 a.m., Bryce Koon responded to both Brian Stempien and Aaron Whaley with the simple confirmation: “Counsel, This will work for us.” His message again included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer indicating the message’s privileged status and that it is intended only for the named recipient, with instructions to contact the firm if received in error and not to disclose or use the information.\n\nLater on October 9, 2023, at 3:26 p.m. (15:26:31 +0000), Brian Stempien sent another reply to Bryce Koon (and to Aaron Whaley) stating: “Assuming this works for Campbell, we will get this set up. Let me know if you are not alright with doing this here. I would like to minimize the logistical challenges for obvious reasons.” Stempien again provided his firm’s contact information and included the customary Privileged and Confidential notice, along with the IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure language applicable to tax communications, and the standard warnings that the information is attorney-privileged and confidential, that no attorney-client relationship is created by emailing, and that if the message is received in error, the recipient should notify the sender and delete it.\n\nThe thread also makes clear multiple standard email disclosures. Each message contains a confidentiality notice asserting attorney privilege, a warning that dissemination or copying is prohibited if the reader is not the intended recipient, and instructions to contact the sender and delete the message if received in error. The notices also reiterate that sending or receipt of the email does not establish an attorney-client relationship, and one message references the caveats required by Circular 230 regarding tax communications.\n\nIn addition to the substantive content, the messages include the participants’ contact details. Brian D. Stempien’s signature lists Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, located in the Jefferson Marders Building at 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, with office phone (502) 245-7474, fax (502) 245-7025, toll-free (866) 431-3599, email bstempien@thattorneys.com, and website http://www.thslaw.co. Bryce Koon’s signature lists The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207.\n\nIn sum, the email chain documents the coordination of counsel regarding the Adkins and Downs v. Nail matter: (1) an attachment of a filed filing in Jefferson Circuit Court on September 28, 2023; (2) confirmation that Ms. Nail had been located and a proposed in-office meeting set for Wednesday, October 18 at 2:00 p.m.; (3) a confirmatory response that the suggested timing works for the other side; and (4) a final communication expressing willingness to proceed with the scheduling as proposed, with all messages accompanied by their customary confidentiality, privilege, and tax-disclosure notices.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita Nicole Downs – MVA matter dated 4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. This note concerns the matter Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit Court, 22-CI-002878).\n\nOn January 16, 2024, in the Destiny Adkins case, a correspondence thread between counsel was exchanged regarding filings and a scheduling matter. Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, along with a copy to Bryce Koon and kpkinney, and Beth Alexander. In her message she stated that there should be three attachments and that she had reattached them. She asked to be informed if the Notice – Motion is still not visible and noted that the Motion Hour is set for January 22, 2024, at 8:25 a.m. She concluded by inviting any questions and providing her contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct line (502) 357-9971; Office (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; Email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note that this is a NEW email address.\n\nEarlier that same day, Bryce Koon, also with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Brian Stempien and kpkinney (cc’d to Sarena Tuttle) with the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). Bryce wrote, “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” He signed with his name and title, providing his firm’s contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone (502) 365-5043; Fax (502) 364-9363. His signature block also included standard attorney disclaimers asserting the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney‑client privileged or protected information, with instructions to contact The Whaley Law Firm if received in error, and a note that no waiver of privilege has occurred. He also included that recipients should not use the information or forward it to third parties not intended to receive it. The signature contained a further notice that no attorney‑client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and referenced the firm’s disclaimer at www.thslaw.co. Additionally, there was an IRS Circular 230 disclaimer stating that if the document does not contain all required tax disclosures, one may not rely on any tax advice contained in the document to avoid penalties, and that no portion of the document may be used in marketing or promotional materials.\n\nLater on January 16, 2024, at approximately 5:07 p.m. (the message shows “5:07?PM”), Brian D. Stempien replied to Bryce. He asked whether there was an intention to file a motion to amend the complaint, noting that what he could see was the amended complaint. His signature block identified him as Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, with office address listed as the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243. His contact numbers included Office (502) 245-7474, Fax (502) 245-7025, Toll Free (866) 431-3599, and his email bstempien@thattorneys.com; his web address was http://www.thslaw.co. His email carried the same Privileged and Confidential notice found in the earlier messages, along with the standard disclaimer that no attorney‑client relationship is created by email and a reference to the firm’s disclosure under the same website. The IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure warning appeared as well.\n\nAcross these communications, the attachments referenced in the messages were indicated as three in total, with Bryce’s message noting the attachments were filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court, and Sarena’s subsequent note confirming the attachments had been reattached and inquiring about the visibility of the Notice – Motion. The thread includes the usual attorney‑client privilege and confidentiality disclaimers, a notice that no attorney‑client relationship is created by email, and the Circular 230 tax disclosures, all of which appear in the signatures of the correspondents.",

      "natural_language": "This case note is for the file labeled Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021, reflecting client Juanita Nicole Downs. The note also references ongoing matter Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case number 22-CI-002878. The message header shows the communication originated from Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm and was sent to Brian Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, with a broad distribution that included Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle of Whaley, as well as two Filevine project email addresses: Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021.\n\nIn a message related to Destiny Adkins v. Nail, Bryce Koon wrote to Brian Stempien with a conditional proposal. He stated that The Whaley Law Firm would agree to dismiss Brian’s client from the case if she amended her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission. He added that, apart from that amendment, he did not believe a voluntary dismissal of Brian’s client could be achieved. He concluded by inviting questions and providing his contact details: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The body and signature blocks include the standard attorney-client privilege and confidentiality disclaimers typical of firm email communications, as well as a tax-related notice required by Circular 230.\n\nThe chain of communications in this matter also includes several prior and related exchanges. On January 16, 2024, Bryce Koon wrote to counsel (and included others in the cc line), with the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). The message stated: “Good afternoon counsel, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” The message was from Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, and it indicated that a filing had been made in Jefferson Circuit Court; the signature block provided the firm’s contact information and reiterated standard privileged/confidentiality language.\n\nLater in the year, on July 22, 2024 at 5:13 PM, Brian Stempien sent a message to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley (with Sarena Tuttle CC’d) asking, “Aaron and Bryce: Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” This message carried the same general privilege and confidentiality disclaimers that appear in the chain, along with the standard firm signatures and contact details.\n\nAgain on September 3, 2024, Brian Stempien sent a succinct inquiry asking, “Guys: Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” with a closing that included his full name, firm, address (Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243), contact numbers, and a standard attorney-client disclaimer. The chain also includes the corresponding email from Bryce Koon in the same thread, reiterating the ongoing discussion about potential dismissal and the conditions under which any dismissal might be considered, as well as the familiar disclaimers and the IRS Circular 230 tax disclaimer that accompanies tax-related communications.\n\nIn summary, the file shows a sequence of communications among counsel about the Destiny Adkins v. Nail case, including a January 2024 filing notice, a July 2024 inquiry about whether Ms. Nail would be released from the case, a September 2024 follow-up question about the same issue, and a key conditional offer from Bryce Koon in a later email stating that a dismissal of a client could be achieved if an amendment to a pleading would indicate that Defendant Turner operated the vehicle with permission. The note also documents ongoing involvement related to the Downs MVA file, with Filevine project email addresses associated to Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Downs MVA.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). The note identifies Juanita Nicole Downs as the client, tied to a motor vehicle accident dated 4/16/2021 (MVA). The file tracking and communications relate to the Destiny Adkins matter, with Filevine project emails included for both Destiny Adkins MVA (04/16/2021) and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA (4/16/2021).\n\nOn September 3, 2024, at 12:19:10 PM Eastern Time, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, KY, sent an email to Brian D. Stempien, Esq., of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, also in Louisville. The message was copied to Aaron Whaley, Esq.; Sarena Tuttle; and to Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA. The subject of the email mirrored the Destiny Adkins case. In the body, Koon stated that “we will agree to dismiss your client from the case if she amends her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission.” He added that, apart from this conditional dismissal, he did not believe a voluntary dismissal of the client could be agreed to. He invited any questions and provided his direct contact information, including his phone number (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207, and identified The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. The email included standard attorney‑client privilege language, noting that the message was intended only for the named recipient and that receipt in error should be reported to the firm, with no waiver of privilege and no attorney‑client relationship presumed. It also contained a Circular 230 tax‑related disclaimer.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 12:10 PM, Brian D. Stempien responded with a brief, pointed inquiry: “Guys: Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” He signed with his full firm information, including his office address at the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, along with office phone (502) 245-7474, fax (502) 245-7025, toll‑free line (866) 431‑3599, and email bstempien@thattorneys.com. His message also carried the same blanket attorney‑client and IRS disclosures customary to the firm, indicating that sending or receiving emails does not establish an attorney‑client relationship and reiterating the general confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nThe email thread includes a prior exchange dating back to July 22, 2024. In that earlier message, Brian Stempien sent a reply to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley at 5:13 PM, asking, “Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” Stempien’s signature block followed, containing the same practice address in Louisville and the same contact numbers, along with the customary privilege and confidentiality disclaimers.\n\nEven earlier, on July 22, 2024, Bryce Koon had sent a message to Brian Stempien and kpkinney@ewenandkinney.com (at 1:10 PM) with the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). Koon thanked counsel and stated, “Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address and phone/fax numbers, followed by the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe chain also shows the January 16, 2024 exchange. In that message, Bryce Koon wrote at 1:10 PM to Brian Stempien and kpkinney@ewenandkinney.com, CC’ing Sarena Tuttle, with the subject Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). He began, “Good afternoon counsel,” and concluded, “Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court.” Once again, the signature identified W. Bryce Koon, The Whaley Law Firm, and included the same address and contact details, along with the standard attorney‑client privilege language.\n\nIn sum, the documented communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC concern the Destiny Adkins v. Nail matter in Jefferson Circuit Court (22-CI-002878) and the related participation of Juanita Nicole Downs in the MVA matters dated 4/16/2021. The central substantive proposal across the latest exchange is that Downs could be dismissed from the case if she amend her Answer and/or discovery responses to assert that Defendant Turner operated the vehicle with permission. The communications include multiple standard confidentiality and privilege disclosures, and the emails reference filevine project accounts for the Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA matters.",

Date: Tue, 3 Sep 2024 16:33:53 +0000.\n\nIn the message, Brian D. Stempien, of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, writing from the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243, told Bryce Koon that “Yeh.. not going to happen. I guess we will have to file something.” He provided the firm’s contact details: Office (502) 245-7474; Fax (502) 245-7025; Toll Free 1 (866) 431-3599; bstempien@thattorneys.com; and the firm website www.thslaw.co. He included a standard attorney-privilege disclaimer and confidentiality notice declaring that the email, its attachments, and the information within are privileged and confidential and intended for the named recipient, that no attorney-client relationship is created by sending or receiving the email, and that if the reader is not the intended recipient the information should not be disseminated or used; recipients are instructed to notify the sender and delete the message. The disclaimer also cites an IRS Circular 230 warning about tax advice, noting that the document may not contain all required disclosures and that nothing in the email should be used to avoid tax penalties or in marketing materials.\n\nThe September 3, 2024 communication from Brian included the following: “Yeh.. not going to happen. I guess we will have to file something.” The email was sent to Bryce Koon and CC’d Aaron Whaley, Sarena Tuttle, Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address, and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address. The email carried the same Privileged and Confidential notice as in the prior correspondence, reiterating that there is no attorney-client relationship by virtue of email and reiterating the IRS Circular 230 warning.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, Bryce Koon replied on September 3, 2024 at 12:19 PM, addressed to Brian Stempien and copied to Aaron Whaley, Sarena Tuttle, Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address, and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 - Filevine Project Email Address. Bryce stated that the parties would agree to dismiss Brian’s client from the case if she amended her Answer and/or discovery responses to state that Defendant Turner was operating her vehicle with permission. Bryce added that, outside of that amendment, he did not believe a voluntary dismissal of Brian’s client could be agreed to. Bryce closed by inviting Brian to contact him with any questions. Bryce’s signature block identified The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207, and included the same standard electronic-disclaimer language about privilege, confidentiality, and the lack of an attorney-client relationship, along with the IRS Circular 230 warning.\n\nAlso on September 3, 2024, at approximately 12:10 PM, Brian Stempien sent a follow-up message with the subject line “Re: Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878).” He wrote, “Guys: Are you going to let my lady out of this case?” This message was sent from Brian Stempien at Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, using the same contact information and incorporating the same Privileged and Confidential notice and disclaimers about attorney-client privilege and tax disclosures.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on Monday, July 22, 2024 at 5:13 PM, Brian Stempien had written to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley (with Sarena Tuttle cc’d) regarding Destiny Adkins, et al. v. Stephanie Nail, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 22-CI-002878). In that message, Brian asked, “Are you guys going to let Ms. Nail out of this case? Give me a call if you would like to discuss.” The email again carried the same firm signature block with the firm’s address in Louisville, phone and toll-free numbers, email address, and website, and it included the same Privileged and Confidential Notice and No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer, along with the Circular 230 tax-disclosure language.\n\nIn all, the record reflects a sequence of communications among counsel regarding the Destiny Adkins v. Nail case, with July 22, 2024 and September 3, 2024 having multiple messages between Brian Stempien and Bryce Koon (and to or from Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle) about the possibility of dismissing a client and specifically about whether an amendment to pleadings would permit a voluntary dismissal. The communications also show that the emails contained standard confidentiality and privilege notices, that no attorney-client relationship is created by email, and that tax-related disclosures under Circular 230 are included where applicable. The note header ties this thread to the unrelated case of Juanita Nicole Downs, the MVA case dated 4-16-2021, and the Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nIn the matter of Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., the file notes reflect a February 2025 set of communications concerning the scheduling of Mr. Turner’s deposition. The correspondence involves The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, and Rice Gumm, PLLC, represented by Eric S. Rice, with multiple participants copied on the exchanges and attached Filevine project email addresses for related MVA clients Destiny Adkins (MVA 04/16/2021) and Juanita Nicole Downs (MVA 4/16/2021).\n\nOn January 21, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to counsel requesting assistance in scheduling Mr. Turner’s deposition and asked that they provide availability for the coming weeks. He asked for Mr. Turner’s availability and concluded by thanking counsel for their attention, signing as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address and contact details, and including the standard attorney‑client privilege disclaimer in his signature. The recipients included Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm, with copies to Brian Stempien and to the Filevine Project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA (04/16/2021) and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA (4/16/2021), as well as Sarena Tuttle.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, Bryce Koon followed up, again requesting an update on the deposition scheduling. He asked counsel to provide any available information and closed with thanks, again listing his contact details and attaching the same party and Filevine project recipients as in the prior message, along with the standard disclaimer in his email signature.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Eric S. Rice replied, stating that he had not yet been able to speak with his client about the deposition. His message identified himself as a partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, and included his direct line and firm contact information, along with the Confidentiality Notice typical to his firm’s emails.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, Eric Rice responded with specific available times for Mr. Turner: he could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, 2025, if those dates worked for the other side. The message was sent from Eric S. Rice, with his signature block including his title, phone number, email, and firm address.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied that, among the proposed dates, the only one that works for their office is February 20. She noted that their office has several mediations and depositions already scheduled for the month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at the opposing counsel’s office. If the client remains incarcerated, she said they would need to check with the jail regarding the process and availability. She included her contact information and stated the note about a new email address, and also their standard confidentiality admonition in the email footer.\n\nFor reference, the email chain contains the following participants and details: Sarena Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note of a new email address), Eric S.

      "natural_language": "In the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter, regarding the MVA related to Juanita Nicole Downs on 4/16/2021, the Whaley Law Firm coordinated scheduling for a deposition of Mr. Turner. The exchange began with an email on January 21, 2025, from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Eric S. Rice, Esq., of Rice Gumm, PLLC, requesting Mr. Turner’s deposition availability for the coming weeks.\n\nBryce followed up on January 28, 2025, asking for any update. In a subsequent email dated January 31, 2025, Eric Rice replied that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. That message was sent to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with Brian Stempien and two Filevine project email addresses—Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021—cc’d, along with Sarena Tuttle.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, Eric Rice wrote again, stating that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12 or 14, and also on February 18, 19, or 20, if those dates worked.\n\nThen, on February 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded that the only date that would work for their office was February 20. She noted that they already had several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at the opposing counsel’s office; if the client remained incarcerated, they would need to check with the jail about its process and availability.\n\nFor reference, Sarena Tuttle’s contact details are The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).

      "natural_language": "This note documents a chain of communications about scheduling the deposition of Mr. Turner in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter, with the case file referenced as Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021. The CC list includes Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 via Filevine project email addresses, as well as the Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC contacts. The Filevine project email addresses shown are DestinyAdkinsMVAZ1161425@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com for Destiny Adkins and JuanitaNicoleDownsMVAZ954678@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com for Juanita Downs.\n\nThe participants in the email thread include Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines are D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email address is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address. The opposing counsel is Eric S. Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, whose office is at 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243. His contact details include a phone number of 502-290-1075 and email eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com, along with the firm’s website www.ricegummlaw.com and a confidentiality notice in his emails.\n\nThe thread begins with a series of scheduling inquiries from The Whaley Law Firm’s Bryce Koon regarding Mr. Turner’s deposition. On January 21, 2025 at 12:42 PM, Bryce emailed counsel requesting Mr. Turner’s deposition availability for the coming weeks. He followed up on January 28, 2025 at 3:28 PM, asking for any update. On January 31, 2025 at 9:55 AM, Eric Rice replied that he had not yet been able to speak with his client.\n\nEric Rice subsequently proposed potential deposition times on February 4, 2025 at 2:06 PM: Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates worked. On February 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied that the only date that works for The Whaley Law Firm’s office would be February 20, and she asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office; if the client were incarcerated, they would need to check with the Jail regarding process and availability. She signed as Sarena M. Tuttle, noting her title and the firm’s contact information, and reminding recipients of the new email address.\n\nLater on February 5, 2025, at 1:50 PM, Eric Rice responded that Mr. Turner would be at his office. Then at 1:56 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent a follow-up message stating that February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would be the date and time to confirm with Mr. Stempien.\n\nThroughout the thread, the signatures for the participants include the standard confidentiality notices common to these communications, the Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm contact details, and the filevine project email addresses referenced above. The exchange confirms that February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm’s offices was the working date and time under consideration, with the understanding that if Mr. Turner were incarcerated, their process with the jail would need to be reviewed. The deposition location was proposed to be at Rice & Gumm’s office, pending Mr. Turner’s status, and the parties remained responsive to confirm the final arrangements.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. This note concerns the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with Destiny Adkins MVA on 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA on 04/16/2021. The record shows correspondence among the Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC to coordinate a deposition or related proceeding involving Mr. Turner, with Filevine project email addresses listed for both Destiny Adkins and Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nIn early February 2025, the scheduling discussion began with Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, who indicated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on certain dates: February 12/14, 18, 19, or 20, if those dates worked. He added that Mr. Turner would be at Rice & Gumm’s office for the deposition. Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied on February 5, 2025, stating that the only date that worked for their office among those proposed was February 20, 2025, and she noted that they had several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice & Gumm’s office, adding that if his client were incarcerated they would need to check with the jail about processes and availability.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Eric Rice had written on February 5, 2025 at 1:50 PM that Mr. Turner would be present at his office. This followed an earlier message from February 4, 2025, in which Eric Rice stated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates worked.\n\nThe chain also shows prior communications: on January 31, 2025, Eric Rice advised that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. He suggested dates for availability and provided his contact information. On January 28, 2025, Bryce Koon had sent a message to Eric Rice and Daniel Gumm with others cc’d, though the contents of that particular email are not summarized in detail here.\n\nWhen the February 5 exchange continued, Sarena Tuttle reiterated the question about whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr. Turner, while also confirming the involvement of Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs as part of the Filevine Project email addresses for their respective MVA matters.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Krista Rice responded from Rice Gumm, PLLC, noting a scheduling conflict with February 20 and asking whether any of February 24, 26, 27, or 28 would work, in addition to proposing those alternatives. Later that same day, Sarena Tuttle replied, explaining that February 24 is a Monday reserved for local motion hours and February 28 is a Friday reserved for Fayette motion hours. She indicated that the firm was available on February 26 or 27 but required an earlier start time of 1:00 PM.\n\nThe email chain is dated February 6, 2025, with the thread titled Re: Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., and includes the standard confidentiality notices typical of the correspondence between law firms. The Whaley Law Firm contact information for Sarena M. Tuttle is listed as: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to please use the new email address.\n\nIn summary, the parties discussed scheduling a deposition related to Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., involving the MVA cases on April 16, 2021, for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs. The Whaley firm could accommodate February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm if Mr. Turner could attend there, but due to conflicts and Mr. Turner’s status, alternate dates were proposed. The Whaley firm suggested February 26 or 27, with a required start time of 1:00 PM, and warned against February 24 and February 28 due to existing commitments (local and Fayette motion hours, respectively). The parties also maintained the Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Downs MVA as part of the case records.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. The client is Juanita Nicole Downs, involved in a motor vehicle accident dated April 16, 2021. The note documents a series of email communications about scheduling a deposition in the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al.\n\nThe exchanges began with The Whaley Law Firm on January 21, 2025, when Bryce Koon, an attorney with The Whaley Law Firm, asked for Mr. Turner’s deposition availability for the coming weeks. On January 28, 2025, Bryce followed up, requesting an update on availability. On January 31, 2025, Eric S. Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, replied that he had not yet been able to speak with his client.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, Eric Rice stated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20, if those dates would work. The next day, February 5, 2025, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied that the only date that works for their office would be February 20th, acknowledging that their calendar includes several mediations and depositions that month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm, and if the client were incarcerated, they would need to coordinate with the jail regarding processes and availability. Later on February 5, Eric Rice responded, “He’ll be here at my office.”\n\nThat same day, February 5, 2025 at 12:00 p.m., Sarena Tuttle sent a follow-up noting that February 20 is the only date that works for their office and reiterating the consideration of the client’s incarceration status and whether the deposition would occur at the office or elsewhere, including the need to check with the jail if incarcerated. At approximately 1:50 p.m. on February 5, Eric Rice replied that Mr. Turner would be at Rice Gumm’s office for the deposition.\n\nAt 1:56 p.m. on February 5, Sarena Tuttle followed up with, “Thank you so much for the confirmation. Mr. Stempien, does February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm, work for you?” This indicates a tentative confirmation of the February 20, 2025, 3:30 p.m. time at Rice & Gumm, subject to Mr. Stempien’s availability.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Krista Rice, the firm administrator at Rice Gumm, PLLC, sent a message noting a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asking for guidance on whether any of the alternative dates—February 24, February 26, February 27, or February 28—would work.\n\nFor reference, the parties involved include The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager; Bryce Koon, Esq.; Daniel Gumm), Rice Gumm, PLLC (Eric S. Rice, Partner; Krista Rice, Firm Administrator), and the clients listed in the Filevine project addresses: Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021. The Whaley Law Firm is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and Rice Gumm, PLLC is located at 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243. The communications include standard confidentiality notices and indicate new email addresses for some recipients (e.g., Sarena Tuttle’s note to use a new email address).\n\nIn summary, the parties were attempting to schedule Mr. Turner’s deposition, with Feb. 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm being proposed and then reevaluated due to a scheduling conflict, with alternative dates of Feb. 24, 26, 27, or 28, 2025 being suggested, all within a back-and-forth spanning January 21 to February 6, 2025.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs.\n\nIn the matter of Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., the following series of scheduling emails occurred in early February 2025 between Rice Gumm, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm, with the involved participants and notices attached to the case of Juanita Nicole Downs (MVA 4/16/2021). The communications concern arranging a deposition for Mr. Turner, who appears to be incarcerated.\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Eric S. Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, wrote to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, cc’ing Brian Stempien and the Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021 Filevine project addresses. In that message, he apologized for not having spoken with his client yet and stated that he had not been able to speak with his client as of that time.\n\nEarlier, on January 28, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq. of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Eric Rice (and others cc’d) and asked for an update, indicating that he was following up on the previous request.\n\nOn February 4, 2025, Eric Rice replied to Bryce and Daniel, indicating that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12 or 14, and also on February 18, 19, or 20, if those dates worked. He concluded that message with his contact details and the Rice Gumm, PLLC information.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded to Krista Rice’s earlier message indicating that the only date among the options that would work for their office would be February 20, 2025. She noted that they have several mediations and depositions scheduled that month. She asked whether Mr. Turner would still be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at the defense office, and she added that if the client is incarcerated they would need to check with the jail regarding process and availability.\n\nLater on February 5, 2025, at 1:50 PM, Eric Rice replied that Mr. Turner would be present at Rice Gumm’s office. He stated, “He’ll be here at my office.”\n\nAt 1:56 PM on February 5, 2025, Sarena Tuttle replied to Eric Rice, asking Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him.\n\nThe thread continued on February 6, 2025, with Sarena Tuttle noting that the 24th is a Monday and would be reserved for local motion hour, and the 28th is a Friday, which is Fayette motion hour. She stated that they were available on the 26th or 27th, but required an earlier start time of 1:00 PM.\n\nIn a follow-up message later on February 6, 2025, Krista Rice responded that Mr. Turner would not be available until 3:30 PM. She asked whether any of the following dates would work: March 6, March 12, March 13, March 19, or March 20.\n\nFor reference, the signatures and contact information embedded in these communications include: Krista Rice, Firm Administrator at Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; phone 502-290-1075; email admin@ricegummlaw.com; website www.ricegummlaw.com; with the confidentially notice typical to emails from Rice Gumm, PLLC. The Rice Gumm, PLLC firm’s office details appear in the messages as well as the “CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE” indicating privileged information.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm’s representative details included Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct dial 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address in the signature). The Whaley Law Firm was copied on the emails to incorporate their availability and scheduling constraints for Mr. Turner’s deposition in Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al.\n\nAdditional participants and project references included the Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021, which were included in the To/Cc lines across the thread.\n\nIn summary, the exchange established that Mr. Turner’s availability centered on 3:30 PM for potential deposition dates in mid-February (February 12/14, 18, 19, or 20) per Eric Rice, but The Whaley Law Firm indicated that February 20 was the only date workable for their office, contingent on Mr. Turner’s incarceration status and the logistics of where the deposition would occur. By February 6, 2025, there was ongoing discussion about alternate February dates (the 24th, 26th, 27th, and 28th) and an adjusted start time of 1:00 PM if those dates were pursued, with Mr. Turner’s availability being a critical factor, and eventual consideration of March dates (March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20) due to the 3:30 PM limitation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. Re: Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. The following is a record of email communications between the parties’ counsel and staff regarding scheduling a deposition for Mr. Turner in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter.\n\nThe correspondence began with Eric Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, sending a message on February 4, 2025, to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, noting that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates worked. Eric’s message is part of a thread that also includes Krista Rice, the firm administrator at Rice Gumm, as well as Sarena Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, and others such as Brian Stempien and Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs via Filevine project addresses.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, at 12:00 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded to Eric Rice. She stated that of the dates proposed by Eric, the only one that would work for The Whaley Law Firm’s office would be February 20. She noted that the firm already had several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month and asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or if the deposition would be held at Rice Gumm’s office; if the client remained incarcerated, she said they would need to check with the jail regarding its process and availability. The message was copied to Krista Rice, with Eric Rice, Bryce Koon, Daniel Gumm, Brian Stempien, and others also on the CC line, including Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA.\n\nLater on February 5, 2025, at 1:56 p.m., Sarena reiterated essentially the same point in a follow-up message: the February 20 date remains the only date that works for The Whaley Law Firm, given their existing schedule of mediations and depositions. She again asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or if the deposition would take place at Rice Gumm’s office, noting that if the client was incarcerated they would need to coordinate with the jail for its process and availability.\n\nEarlier that day, at 1:50 p.m., Eric Rice replied with a simple acknowledgment: “He’ll be here at my office.” Eric signed as a Partner at Rice Gumm, PLLC, with contact information listed as 502-290-1075 and eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com, and the firm’s Louisville address at 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243, along with the firm’s website.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, at 12:00 p.m. again, Sarena had previously reminded that the only date workable for their office was February 20 and had asked about the status of Mr. Turner’s incarceration and location for deposition.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, at about 9:58 a.m., Sarena sent another message explaining scheduling constraints: February 24 is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and February 28 is a Friday Fayette motion hour. She indicated that February 26 or 27 would work for them, but they would need an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m.\n\nAlso on February 6, 2025, at 9:35 a.m., Krista Rice replied to all, noting a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asking if any of the dates February 24, 26, 27, or 28 would work instead.\n\nSubsequently, at 10:25 a.m. (times shown in the thread), Krista Rice offered an alternative that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m., and asked whether any of the dates March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20 would work.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:28:37 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena Tuttle asked, “Is there a valid reason for his unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m.?” in reference to the proposed scheduling constraints.\n\nThe thread includes earlier exchanges as well, including a February 5 message chain where Sarena asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated and whether the deposition could be held at Rice Gumm’s office, and a note that the deposition would require coordination with the jail if incarceration remained a factor. The record also contains references to Filevine project emails for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021, indicating the case files and client records involved in the scheduling process.\n\nThere is also a dated entry from January 31, 2025, where Eric Rice sent a message to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm; however, the content of that correspondence is not fully shown in this record. The overall tenor of the exchanges is that the parties are working to find a workable deposition date for Mr. Turner, with The Whaley Law Firm preferring February 20 at 1:00 p.m. or later depending on availability, and Rice Gumm proposing various February and March options, all while trying to determine whether Mr. Turner would attend in person at the office or be detained/in jail.\n\nIn summary, this note documents the back-and-forth efforts of counsel and staff to schedule a deposition in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter, balancing the client’s availability, potential incarceration status, and existing court- and firm-initiated motion hours on specific dates in February and March 2025. The record ends with ongoing questions about the reasons for any unavailability before 3:30 p.m. and the need to confirm a suitable date and location.",

      "natural_language": "This case note documents a February 2025 volley of scheduling emails between entities representing the parties in Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., regarding the deposition of a Mr. Turner in connection with the matter involving Juanita Nicole Downs, the client in the motor vehicle accident case Downs v. Nail (MVA date: 4/16/2021).\n\nOn January 31, 2025 at 9:55 AM, Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC wrote to Bryce Koon and Daniel Gumm, with copies to Brian Stempien and the Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021, as well as Sarena Tuttle. He indicated that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. He stated that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates would work.\n\nOn February 4, 2025 at 2:06 PM, Eric Rice again corresponded with Bryce, replying that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 PM on February 12 or 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates were workable.\n\nOn February 5, 2025 at 12:00 PM, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded that the only date that would work for their office would be February 20, 2025. She explained they have several mediations and depositions scheduled for the month and asked whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or would attend the deposition at Rice & Gumm’s office; if incarcerated, they would need to check with the jail regarding processes and availability.\n\nAt about 1:50 PM on February 5, 2025, Eric Rice replied, “He’ll be here at my office,” indicating that Turner would attend at Rice & Gumm’s office rather than at a jail location.\n\nAlso on February 5, 2025 at 1:56 PM, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged the confirmation and asked Mr. Stempien whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him.\n\nOn February 5, 2025 at 1:56 PM, Sarena followed up with a separate message confirming that February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm was the date that works for their office, and reiterated the need to know whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or would attend in their office, since if incarcerated they would need to coordinate with the jail.\n\nOn February 6, 2025 at 9:35 AM, Krista Rice responded to the group by noting a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asked whether any of the alternative dates—February 24, 26, 27, or 28—would work.\n\nLater on February 6, 2025 at 9:58 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied that February 24 is a Monday (local motion hour) and February 28 is a Friday (Fayette motion hour). She stated that they were available on February 26 or 27 but required an earlier start time of 1:00 PM.\n\nAt about 10:25 AM on February 6, 2025, Krista Rice responded that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 PM and proposed new dates: March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20.\n\nFinally, at 10:29 AM on February 6, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent a reply asking whether any of the proposed dates would work or if additional dates were needed.\n\nThe initial email in the thread—dated February 6, 2025 at 16:20:49 +0000 from Krista Rice—summarized the ongoing exchange by asking for confirmation on whether any of the proposed dates would work or if Krista should provide additional options. The correspondence chain also confirms the participants and roles: Krista Rice (Firm Administrator for Rice Gumm, PLLC), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm), with other participants including Eric Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC) and Brian Stempien (involved in the matter), as well as the Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021.\n\nKey details preserved across the notes include:\n- The case name and status: Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with client Juanita Nicole Downs related to a motor vehicle accident on 4/16/2021.\n- The deposition planning for Mr. Turner, with the deposition location being potentially at Rice & Gumm, PLLC (Eric Rice’s office) unless Turner is incarcerated.\n- The specific dates and times proposed and discussed: initial options of 3:30 PM on February 12, 14, 18, 19, or 20; then adjustments to February 20; consideration of February 24, 26, 27, or 28 with a preferred 1:00 PM start; and later consideration of March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20 with a 3:30 PM or other times as discussed.\n- Scheduling constraints noted by the offices: local motion hour on February 24, Fayette motion hour on February 28, the need for an earlier start on February 26 or 27, and the requirement to confirm whether Turner would appear in person at the office or be incarcerated.\n- The involved parties and their contact details as reflected in the email headers, including multiple participants and the Filevine project email addresses related to Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 4/16/2021.\n\nIn sum, this is a recorded exchange in early February 2025 among Rice Gumm, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm, together with associated counsel, working to coordinate a deposition of Mr. Turner in the Adkins & Downs v Nail case, with a focus on determining an acceptable date, time, and location given Turner’s availability and the courts’ and offices’ scheduling constraints.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., the file titled Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021 concerns Juanita Nicole Downs (a motor vehicle accident claimant whose incident occurred on 04/16/2021) along with Destiny Adkins (also a 04/16/2021 MVA file). The deposition in question was for the defendant, Turner, and the parties were attempting to schedule it during normal business hours with enough time to conduct a proper deposition.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue unfolded in a series of emails exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC, beginning on February 5, 2025. Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent the initial message to Eric Rice and Krista Rice, with copies to others including Brian Stempien and colleagues handling the Destiny Adkins MVA and Juanita Downs MVA matters via their Filevine project addresses. The subject of the thread was Re: Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. In that first message, Sarena asked whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm would work for Mr. Stempien, expressing that she appreciated the confirmation and seeking a firm answer about the date and time.\n\nEric Rice replied later that day, stating that Mr. Turner would be at his office. In response, Sarena asked Mr. Stempien to confirm whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm work for him. Eric’s reply indicated that Turner would attend at Rice & Gumm’s office, and Sarena reiterated the request to confirm.\n\nOn February 6, 2025, Sarena followed up with Krista, asking whether there was a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m. Krista initially noted that Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m. and asked whether any of several dates would work: March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20. Earlier in the day, Krista had informed the group that Turner was not available until 3:30 p.m. and proposed those dates, given a scheduling conflict for February 20, 2025.\n\nSarena responded that she needed to know Turner’s availability rather than the dates alone. She explained that the 24th of February is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and the 28th is a Friday reserved for Fayette motion hour, and that they were available on February 26 or February 27, but they required an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m. Krista acknowledged the scheduling constraints but reiterated the February 20 conflict and asked for confirmation of any of the proposed dates (February 24, 26, 27, or 28). Krista then proposed additional March dates (March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20) since Turner’s schedule appeared limited.\n\nSarena pressed back, noting that the 24th and 28th dates were constrained by motion-hour commitments and that they could accommodate February 26 or 27 if a 1:00 p.m. start could be arranged. She also asked if a valid reason existed for Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 p.m., given the expectation that the deposition occur during normal business hours and with sufficient duration. These exchanges included the standard confidentiality notices typical of communications with Rice Gumm, PLLC, and the messages carried the usual email signatures with contact information for the participants.\n\nOver the course of the exchange, the participants referenced the deposition window for Turner and debated whether a 1:00 p.m. start would be feasible or if a later start (such as 3:30 p.m.) could be accommodated. The thread recorded a pattern of back-and-forth about available dates (late February into March) and explicit concern from the Whaley team that an hour and a half would not be enough time for a proper deposition, plus the need to schedule within regular business hours. The communications also documented that several emails included the Filevine Project email addresses for Destiny Adkins and Juanita Downs, reflecting their involvement in the related MVA matters.\n\nIn sum, the notes capture a multi-party effort in early February 2025 to schedule a deposition for Def Turner, with the core tension centered on start times and the allocation of several February and March dates around court motion hours (notably the 24th and 28th February) and the requirement for a 1:00 p.m. start to ensure a proper deposition within normal business hours. The exchanges included multiple signatories and attachments, including the standard confidentiality notices embedded in each Rice Gumm, PLLC email.",

Nail, et al.",
      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita Nicole Downs MVA, 4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. This narrative summarizes the email correspondence from February 5–6, 2025 concerning scheduling a deposition in the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., in which Juanita Nicole Downs is the client in the motor vehicle accident (MVA) case dated 4-16-2021. The thread shows communications among the Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm, PLLC, with copies to other counsel, regarding whether and when to depose a person named Def Turner, and how to address the start time and duration of the deposition.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm emailed Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC (and Krista Rice, the firm administrator, with others CC’d) to propose February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm as the deposition date and location for Def Turner. She referenced Mr. Stempien in her note and asked whether that date and time would work for him. The message includes the confidentiality notice typical of emails between counsel. In response, Eric Rice replied that “he’ll be here at my office,” indicating that Def Turner would attend the deposition at Rice Gumm’s office.\n\nLater on February 5, Krista Rice followed up with a scheduling question, noting a conflict with February 20 and asking whether any of several alternative dates would work: February 24, 26, 27, or 28. This message also carries the confidentiality notice. The thread then shows a back-and-forth addressing Turner’s availability: Sarena asked whether there was a valid reason for his unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m., while Krista reiterated that Turner was not available until 3:30 and proposed additional dates in March: March 6, 12, 13, 19, or 20.\n\nAs this exchange continued, Sarena again pressed for a valid reason if the deposition could not start at 1:00 p.m. or sooner, emphasizing that the start time matters and that the client is obligated to appear for a deposition during normal business hours. Krista’s replies attempted to converge on workable dates, asking whether any of the proposed dates would be suitable or if more information was needed. The messages again note Turner’s restriction to a later start time, and the team considered multiple date options across late February and March.\n\nThroughout the thread, the participants reference the same core issue: whether Def Turner can appear for a deposition starting at or before 1:00 p.m. on a weekday, and if not, whether a 3:30 p.m. start could be accommodated on the proposed dates. Eric Rice’s initial instruction suggested that a motion could be filed if needed and indicated a belief that the matter was not difficult to resolve, noting that there was no evidence Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided a sworn answer stating he was not driving, along with references to the listed insured and vehicle owner. He also suggested explaining why a 3:30 start could work for the 20th.\n\nThe chain shows the Whaley Law Firm’s calendar management for the deposition in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail case, with the deposition of Def Turner ultimately being coordinated around Turner’s stated availability and the parties’ preference for a deposition during normal business hours. The email headers reveal the involved parties and contact points: Eric S. Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC), Krista Rice (Firm Administrator), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm), and other recipients including Bryce Koon and Brian Stempien, with multiple copies and the standard confidentiality notices attached to every message. The chain also lists the respective firms’ contact details: Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243, and the Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville office, along with phone numbers and emails for the participants.\n\nIn sum, the notes reflect an active scheduling dispute over when Def Turner could be deposed in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter, with the opposing sides debating start times (1:00 p.m. or earlier versus a earliest permissible 3:30 p.m.), possible dates in February and March, and the strategic option of filing another motion to compel if a reasonable start time could not be agreed upon. The discussion consistently emphasizes that the deposition should occur during normal business hours and that a deposition lasting about one and a half hours is deemed insufficient if the start time cannot be moved earlier. The correspondence is dated February 5–6, 2025, and contains the typical confidentiality notices found in all communications among counsel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nThis note summarizes a sequence of email communications about scheduling a deposition in the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., concerning the client Juanita Nicole Downs in a motor vehicle collision that occurred on 4/16/2021.\n\nOn February 5, 2025, at 1:56 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a message to Eric Rice, Bryce Koon, Daniel Gumm, Brian Stempien, and related Filevine project addresses for the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter. She thanked Mr. Stempien for some prior confirmation and asked whether February 20, 2025 at 3:30 PM at Rice & Gumm would work for him. The email references “Mr. Stempien” and notes the inquiry was in the context of the deposition scheduling. The message was sent with standard confidentiality language and included the Whaley Law Firm’s contact details and the new email address for Sarena Tuttle.\n\nEarlier in the day, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC had asked for guidance on whether the proposed dates would work or if additional information was needed. Krista indicated a scheduling conflict for 2/20 and proposed alternative dates: 2/24, 2/26, 2/27, or 2/28.\n\nSarena responded later that morning (9:58 AM) with a question: was there a valid reason for the unavailability prior to 3:30 PM? She asked this in the context of the request to depose the deponent at times other than 1:00 PM, emphasizing that the dates were not the sole issue and that the start time mattered.\n\nKrista replied at 10:25 AM, explaining that Mr. Turner was not available until 3:30 PM and asking whether any of the following dates would work: 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, or 3/20. Krista included her standard firm signature block for Rice Gumm, PLLC.\n\nSarena pushed back again at 10:29 AM, asking whether there was a valid reason for the unavailability before 3:30 PM. In response, Krista later proposed further options and asked for confirmation on which dates would work, citing that 2/20 had a conflict and reiterating the 1:00 PM start preference if possible.\n\nAt 11:20 AM (and again at 11:27 AM), Krista confirmed that the proposed dates were to be considered or requested additional information, while Sarena insisted that the reason for the later start time be provided and reiterated that the start time was the core issue. She stated that the client is obligated to appear for a deposition during normal business hours and that an hour-and-a-half would not be sufficient to conduct a proper deposition. She warned that without a valid reason why Def Turner could not appear at 1:00 PM or sooner, the opposing side could deem him uncooperative and pursue another motion to compel. These messages were sent with the Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality language.\n\nIn the thread, Krista had previously outlined available dates when she could confirm scheduling, noting the presence of a local motion hour on 2/24 (a Monday) and Fayette motion hour on 2/28 (a Friday), and stating that they were available on 2/26 or 2/27 but required an earlier start time of 1:00 PM. She listed dates including 2/24, 2/26, 2/27, and 2/28, and then later noted that 2/20 was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict.\n\nThe exchange also contained standard agency notices typical of attorney communications, including the formatting and disclaimers for Privileged and Confidential Information and the IRS Circular 230 warning regarding tax advice, embedded in the messages from Stempien and the various firm signatures.\n\nOverall, the thread reflects a persistent effort to schedule the deposition in Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with ongoing disputes over the acceptable start time (preferably 1:00 PM) and a series of proposed dates in February and March 2025, while ensuring compliance with normal business hours and addressing the scheduling constraints of Mr. Turner. The case note consistently references the client, Juanita Nicole Downs, and the underlying MVA matter dated 4/16/2021.",

      "natural_language": "The file documents the case Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., involving Juanita Nicole Downs as the client in an MVA matter dated 4-16-2021. The case note is part of the Juanita Nicole Downs MVA file, with the file name “Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021.”\n\nIn early February 2025, counsel from multiple firms were attempting to schedule a deposition in this matter. On February 6, 2025, at 4:33 p.m. UTC, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC sent an email regarding the scheduling and stated, “We should be able to make any day work, so please just let me know once you guys hammer out the date.” His message included his firm’s contact information: Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1 (866) 431-3599; Email: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Web: http://www.thslaw.co. The email carried the customary privileged and confidential disclaimer, noting that the information was attorney-privileged and confidential, intended only for the named recipient; it warned that dissemination or copying was prohibited if you were not the intended recipient, and urged the reader to contact the sender and delete the message if received in error. It also stated that no attorney-client relationship is established by sending or receiving e-mails with the firm, and it included the IRS Circular 230 tax disclosure warning about potential tax penalties in relation to tax advice.\n\nEarlier that same week, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC replied on February 6, 2025 at 9:35 a.m. to Sarena Rice’s email, and to others, explaining that there was a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asking whether any of the dates February 24, 26, 27, or 28 would work. Krista’s message included her firm’s contact details: 502-290-1075; admin@ricegummlaw.com; Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; www.ricegummlaw.com; and the firm’s logo.\n\nThe thread also shows earlier communications from The Whaley Law Firm. On February 5, 2025, at 1:56 p.m., Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Eric Rice and CC’d Bryce Koon, Daniel Gumm, Brian Stempien, and Filevine project addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 04/16/2021. The subject was the same matter. Sarena asked, “Thank you so much for the confirmation. Mr. Stempien, does February 20, 2025 at 3:30p at Rice & Gumm, work for you?” Her signature block provided her title and firm details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nIn response on February 5, 2025 at 1:50 p.m., Eric Rice, a partner at Rice Gumm, replied, “He’ll be here at my office.” Eric’s contact details are shown as: 502-290-1075; eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com; Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; www.ricegummlaw.com.\n\nEarlier still, on February 4, 2025, at 2:06 p.m., Eric Rice wrote to Bryce that Mr. Turner could be available at 3:30 p.m. on February 12 or 14, 18, 19, or 20 if those dates would work. He signed as Eric S. Rice, Partner, with the same Rice Gumm contact details and confidentiality notice.\n\nOn February 4, 2025 at 1:56 p.m.—or around that time, as reflected in the chain—the message from Sarena Tuttle captured a key response from the Whaley team: “The only one of those dates that works for our office would be February 20th. We have several Mediations & Depositions already scheduled for this month. Is/will your client, Mr. Turner, still be incarcerated or will this deposition take place at your office? If your client is still incarcerated, we will need to check with the Jail for their process & availability.” Sarena’s contact information and Whaley Law Firm details followed.\n\nEarlier still, on February 5, 2025 at 12:00 p.m., Sarena again wrote to Eric Rice, restating that February 20th was the only date that worked for their office, and reiterating the need to know whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or available for a deposition at the office, noting the jail’s process and availability if incarceration continued.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 at 9:55 a.m., Eric Rice had told Bryce (with others copied) that he had not yet been able to speak with his client. His message began, “Bello Bryce, I haven’t been able to speak with my client as of yet,” and was sent from Eric S. Rice, Partner, Rice Gumm, PLLC, with the firm’s address and website. The thread then shows further scheduling discussions emerging in February.\n\nIn summary, the email chain shows a coordinated effort among counsel at Rice Gumm, The Whaley Law Firm, and Travis Herbert & Stempien to schedule a deposition for Mr. Turner in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al. matter. The proposed target date was February 20, 2025 at 3:30 p.m. at Rice & Gumm’s offices, contingent on Mr. Turner’s availability and whether he would be incarcerated or could attend at the office. If the February 20 slot could not be used, Krista Rice proposed alternatives for February 24, 26, 27, or 28, due to a scheduling conflict for February 20. Brian Stempien stated that they should be able to accommodate any day once a date was hammered out. The thread cites Filevine project email addresses for Destiny Adkins MVA 04/16/2021 and Juanita Nicole Downs MVA 04/16/2021, and includes the standard confidentiality and privilege notices, along with the No Attorney-Client Relationship disclaimer and the IRS Circular 230 tax-advice disclosure.\n\nThe addresses and contact details that appear in these communications include:\n- Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, 11507 Main Street, Jefferson Marders Building, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1-866-431-3599; Email: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Web: http://www.thslaw.co.\n- Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; Office: (502) 290-1075; Email: eric.rice@ricegummlaw.com; Website: www.ricegummlaw.com; Admin: admin@ricegummlaw.com.\n- The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct: (502) 357-9971; Office: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new address).\n\nThe chain of messages demonstrates the parties’ efforts to set a deposition date in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter, with ongoing coordination about availability, location, and whether Mr. Turner would be incarcerated or able to attend at the requested office location.",

      "natural_language": "This note records the deposition scheduling discussions for the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., with the client noted as Juanita Nicole Downs. The file header shows the case reference and participant names, and the most recent outreach occurred on March 4, 2025, when Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC emailed colleagues to ask, “Did you guys get a date for this depo?” The email was sent from Stempien to Eric S. Rice (Rice Gumm, PLLC), Sarena Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), and Krista Rice (admin at Rice Gumm, PLLC), with a copy to Bryce at Whaley Law Firm. Stempien’s full contact details were included in his signature, along with a note indicating the message was Privileged and Confidential, and the standard attorney-privilege disclaimers. The firm’s address is the Jefferson Marders Building, 11507 Main Street, Middletown Historic District, Louisville, KY 40243; office phone 502-245-7474; fax 502-245-7025; toll-free 1-866-431-3599; email bstempien@thattorneys.com; website www.thslaw.co.\n\nThe February 6, 2025 exchanges lay out a scheduling push with several participants: Krista Rice (Firm Administrator, Rice Gumm, PLLC, Louisville, KY), Sarena M. Tuttle (Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, The Whaley Law Firm), Eric Rice (Partner, Rice Gumm, PLLC), Bryce (Whaley Law Firm), and Brian Stempien (Travis Herbert & Stempien). The central issue was locating a deposition time for the deponent, referred to as Def Turner, in a way that satisfies all sides given Turner’s availability and the court-imposed motion-hour constraints.\n\nFirst, on February 6, 2025 at 9:35 a.m., Krista Rice noted that there was a scheduling conflict for February 20 and asked whether any of the proposed dates—February 24, 26, 27, or 28—would work, inviting input from the team. In response, at 9:58 a.m., Sarena Tuttle explained that February 24 is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and February 28 is a Fayette motion hour, and that they were available on February 26 or 27, but required an earlier start time of 1:00 p.m. She supplied the same availability details with her signature and NEW email address.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 10:25 a.m., Sarena followed up with a different set of proposed dates because Mr. Turner would not be available until 3:30 p.m. She asked whether any of the dates 3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, or 3/20 would work. Krista responded at 10:29 a.m. asking if there was a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m. and emphasizing that the start time was the issue, since an hour and a half is not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition; she noted that Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 p.m. could lead to a motion to compel if no valid justification was provided.\n\nSarena replied at 11:27 a.m., reiterating the concern about the start time rather than the dates themselves, stating that Turner would be unavailable before 3:30 and that 1:00 p.m. starts and a 1.5-hour deposition were not adequate. She warned that Turner could be deemed uncooperative and that another motion to compel might be filed if a valid reason for the limited availability was not provided. Her message carried the Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality notice and reiterated her contact details.\n\nAt 11:30 a.m., Eric Rice weighed in, advising that Bryce could file a motion and that counsel could explain to the judge that there was no evidence Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided a sworn statement indicating he was not driving, along with the listed insured and vehicle owner. Eric suggested it would be appropriate to explain why a 3:30 start would work for the 20th, and stated that this was not a difficult issue. He signed with his title, office details, and firm information, and included the confidentiality notice.\n\nThe chain of messages also references earlier scheduling options, including February 20 as a conflict, with contemplation of February 24, 26, 27, or 28 as possible windows, and later consideration of March dates (3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, 3/20) when Turner would be available at 3:30 p.m. The correspondence notes that the 24th is a Monday reserved for local motion hour and the 28th is a Friday Fayette motion hour, thus impacting the feasibility of those dates; the Whaley team suggested 26th or 27th as possibilities with a 1:00 p.m. start, while Rice Gumm proposed later March dates with Turner available after 3:30.\n\nThis lengthy email thread thus captures the scheduling impasse: Turner’s unavailability before 3:30 p.m. on certain days, the need for a start time of 1:00 p.m. or later, the desire to avoid local and Fayette motion-hour days, and the willingness of counsel to pursue relief via a motion to compel if a reasonable, compliant deposition time could not be agreed upon. The March 4, 2025 message from Brian Stempien serves as a follow-up prompting confirmation of a deposition date.\n\nIn sum, the parties attempted to resolve when and how to depose Def Turner in Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., balancing Turner’s availability, the required deposition duration of at least 1 hour and 30 minutes, and the court’s motion-hour constraints, while maintaining confidentiality and preserving attorney-client communications throughout.

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021\nClient: Juanita Nicole Downs\n\nThis notes pertain to the matter Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., and document a deposition-scheduling dialogue among counsel for the parties. The deposition in question concerns a defendant identified as Turner and is part of the Adkins & Downs v. Nail case.\n\nIn the email thread dated February 6, 2025, Krista Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC informed the opposing side that Mr. Turner is not available until 3:30 p.m. She asked whether any of the proposed dates would work: March 6, March 12, March 13, March 19, or March 20. A few minutes later, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm asked whether there was a valid reason for Turner’s unavailability prior to 3:30 p.m. She stated that the issue was not the dates themselves but the start time.\n\nKrista Rice replied later that morning, asking to know whether any of the proposed dates could work or whether additional information was needed. In response, Sarena Tuttle asserted that the start time was the critical issue: Turner’s deposition should occur during normal business hours, and one hour and a half is not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition. She warned that, without a valid reason why Turner could not appear at 1:00 p.m. or earlier, Turner could be deemed uncooperative and a motion to compel might be filed.\n\nEric Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC then joined the thread, advising that Bryce could file a motion and that they could explain to the judge that there is no evidence Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided sworn testimony stating he was not driving, alongside the listed insured and vehicle owner. He also suggested explaining why 3:30 p.m. could work for the 20th, stating, “This is not difficult.”\n\nThe thread then shows continuing exchanges within the same day, including the standard confidentiality and attorney-privilege disclosures typical of these communications.\n\nOn March 4, 2025 at approximately 1:38 PM, Brian D. Stempien of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC asked, “Did you guys get a date for this depo?” In reply, Sarena Tuttle, the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, said, “Good afternoon Mr. Stempien, Unfortunately, no. This deposition has not yet been scheduled. Bryce is in a deposition out of town today but I will follow up with him upon his return later this afternoon.” She signed as before, noting her contact information and new email address.\n\nThe underlying context is that the parties are attempting to schedule the deposition of Turner in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail case, with the defense proposing 3:30 p.m. starts and a set of potential dates (3/6, 3/12, 3/13, 3/19, 3/20). The plaintiff’s side has insisted the deposition occur earlier in the day or at a time that would allow a longer, properly conducted deposition, and there has been discussion of motions to compel if a reasonable scheduling arrangement cannot be reached. As of March 4, 2025, no date for the deposition had been set, and Bryce was temporarily unavailable due to being in another deposition out of town.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Juanita-Nicole-Downs-MVA-4-16-2021. Client: Juanita Nicole Downs. In the matter captioned Adkins & Downs v. Nail, et al., the Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm PLLC were coordinating regarding the deposition of Demetrius Turner. On March 5, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent counsel a notice to take the deposition of Demetrius Turner. The deposition was scheduled for April 17, 2025 at 12:00 p.m. at Turner’s attorney’s office, Rice Gumm PLLC. The notice was attached, and the email invited any questions and offered to discuss them further. The message was addressed to Brian Stempien and CC’d to Eric Rice, Krista Rice, and Bryce from Whaley Law Firm. The Whaley email included Sarena’s contact information and noted a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville office is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; the email signature also advised that the address contains the new contact email.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on March 4, 2025, at about 1:40 p.m. (the exact minute is recorded as 1:40?PM), Sarena Tuttle wrote to Mr. Stempien: unfortunately, the deposition had not yet been scheduled. Bryce was in a deposition out of town that day, but she would follow up with him upon his return later that afternoon. Her message reiterated her role and provided the same office details and new email address.\n\nIn response, at around 1:38 p.m. on March 4, 2025, Brian Stempien asked, “Did you guys get a date for this depo? Thank You,” and signed as part of Travis Herbert & Stempien, PLLC, with the firm’s address in Louisville and standard contact details (Office: (502) 245-7474; Fax: (502) 245-7025; Toll Free: 1-866-431-3599; Email: bstempien@thattorneys.com; Web: http://www.thslaw.co). The chain includes the typical attorney-client confidentiality and privilege notices that accompany these communications.\n\nThroughout this same February–March period, an earlier chain (starting February 6, 2025) involved Eric S. Rice of Rice Gumm, PLLC, communicating with Sarena Tuttle, Krista Rice, Bryce, and Brian Stempien. In Eric Rice’s February 6, 2025 message, he suggested that Bryce could file a motion and explained that there was no evidence Demetrius Turner was driving and that Turner had already provided sworn testimony stating he was not driving, along with the listed insured and vehicle owner. He also noted the possibility of explaining why 3:30 p.m. had been proposed for the 20th (February 20, 2025). The message is embedded with Rice Gumm’s standard confidentiality and privilege notices and includes the firm’s contact information: Rice Gumm, PLLC, 12804 Townepark Way, Ste. 200, Louisville, KY 40243; website www.ricegummlaw.com.\n\nEarlier still, on February 6, 2025, Sarena Tuttle responded to Krista Rice with a query: “Care to provide the reason?” She indicated that the dates were not the issue; the start time was. She emphasized that the client is obligated to provide his deposition during normal business hours and that an hour and a half is not sufficient to conduct a proper deposition. She warned that without a valid reason why Demetrius Turner was unavailable before 1:00 p.m. or sooner, he could be considered uncooperative and that they would be forced to file another motion to compel.\n\nIn a contemporaneous thread, Krista Rice (Firm Administrator for Rice Gumm, PLLC) replied on February 6, 2025, asking if any of the proposed dates would work or if additional options were needed. Her message included her contact information: 502-290-1075 and admin@ricegummlaw.com, along with Rice Gumm’s Louisville address and website. The chain also contains the standard confidentiality notices found in these exchanges.\n\nThe February 6, 2025 communications included a response from Sarena Tuttle later that morning (or around 11:27 a.m.), reaffirming that the issue was the start time rather than the dates and reiterating the expectation that Turner appear within normal business hours for a deposition lasting approximately 1.5 hours. She again cautioned that Turner’s unavailability before 1:00 p.m. without a valid reason could lead to a motion to compel, consistent with their procedural posture in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail matter.\n\nIn short, the notes document a pending deposition notice for Demetrius Turner scheduled for April 17, 2025 at 12:00 p.m. at Rice Gumm PLLC, issued March 5, 2025 by The Whaley Law Firm on behalf of Juanita Nicole Downs in the Adkins & Downs v. Nail dispute. They also reveal a back-and-forth in early February and early March 2025 about scheduling, preferred start times (with particular focus on 1:00 p.m., 3:30 p.m., and the potential 3:30 start for February 20, 2025), the assertion that Turner’s deposition should occur during normal business hours, the possibility of filing motions to compel if Turner's unavailability could not be justified, and the ongoing coordination between The Whaley Law Firm and Rice Gumm PLLC, including multiple standard confidentiality and privilege notices and the clients’ and counsel’s contact details.",
