      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nThis external claim, AP92071 for Muhammad Alif, was handled between The Whaley Law Firm and West Bend Mutual Insurance during November 2022. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s attorney, Sarena M. Tuttle, sent communications to Ashley Becerra, a Senior Claims Representative with West Bend Mutual Insurance, regarding representation, documentation, and the firm\u2019s W-9 information, as well as liability discussions.\n\nOn November 22, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle responded to Ashley Becerra after a call about the letter of representation. She stated that she had reviewed the document and was not sure why UM/UIM language had been inserted, and she attached an updated letter of representation for West Bend\u2019s file. Her message included her contact details and a note to use her new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and phone numbers were listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nBetween November 28 and November 29, 2022, the correspondence shifted to administrative matters. On November 28, Ashley wrote that she needed a W-9 so she could add The Whaley Law Firm to West Bend\u2019s system. Her signature block identified her role and provided West Bend Mutual Insurance contact details: 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095; Toll Free 800.760.9250 Ext 3631; Ph: 608-410-3631; Fx: 877-434-9585; Email: abecerra@wbmi.com.\n\nIn the early hours of November 29, 2022, Sarena replied to Ashley with \u201cPlease find an updated W-9 attached. Please contact our office to discuss your liability decision as soon as possible.\u201d This message carried Sarena\u2019s signature block, reiterating the same contact information and noting the \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d The W-9 was attached in that communication.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:10 AM, Ashley responded: \u201cPlease forward me a W-9 so I can have your firm added to our system.\u201d This note was sent to Sarena and mirrored West Bend\u2019s procedural request for vendor addition.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, the thread shows Ashley stating: \u201cWe are still pending a statement to finalize our liability.\u201d In response, Sarena asked for clarification: \u201cCan you please clarify whose statement you are still pending?\u201d This exchange suggests a need to identify the particular liability statement West Bend was awaiting.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the parties referenced the case and the claim, with Sarena repeatedly providing representation-related documents (including an updated LOR on November 22 and a W-9 on November 29) and Ashley seeking the W-9 for system setup and confirming the status of liability discussions. The record includes both parties\u2019 standard contact details and underscores the ongoing administrative and liability-related discussions surrounding AP92071 for Muhammad Alif.",

She thanked Ashley for the call about the letter of representation, stated that she had reviewed the document and was not sure why UM/UIM language had been inserted there, and attached an updated letter of representation for West Bend\u2019s file.\n\nSubsequently, on November 28, 2022 at 3:18 PM, Ashley Becerra replied requesting that a W-9 be sent so she could add The Whaley Law Firm to West Bend\u2019s system.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, at 9:45 AM, Sarena responded to Ashley: good morning, she attached the W-9 and asked Ashley to contact The Whaley Law Firm to discuss West Bend\u2019s liability decision as soon as possible.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. The matter concerned an external claim, AP92071, on behalf of Muhammad Alif, with West Bend Mutual Insurance as the insurer and The Whaley Law Firm coordinating representation for the client.\n\nThe communications began with a November 22, 2022 email from Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Ashley Becerra, a Senior Claims Representative with West Bend Mutual Insurance, regarding the letter of representation. Sarena stated that she had reviewed the document and was not sure why UM/UIM language had been inserted, and she attached an updated Letter of Representation for West Bend\u2019s file. Her message included her contact details and noted her new email address. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address was 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a direct line at (502) 357-9971 and office line at (502) 583-4022 ext 104; her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a parenthetical reminder to note the new email address.\n\nOn November 28, 2022, Ashley Becerra replied directing that a W-9 be forwarded so West Bend could add The Whaley Law Firm to their system. Ashley\u2019s contact details were listed as West Bend Mutual Insurance, 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095, with a toll-free line at 800.760.9250 ext 3631, direct line at 608-410-3631, fax at 877-434-9585, and email abecerra@wbmi.com.\n\nThe following day, November 29, 2022, at 9:45 AM, Sarena sent another email acknowledging the request and attaching the W-9, stating, \u201cPlease find the W-9 attached. Please contact our office to discuss your liability decision as soon as possible.\u201d Her signature again displayed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s details, including the Louisville address and phone numbers, and her new email address.\n\nLater on November 29, 2022, at 10:10 AM, Ashley replied, requesting that the W-9 be forwarded so that West Bend could add The Whaley Law Firm to their system. This mirrored the earlier request and emphasized the need to complete the secure setup in their system.\n\nEarlier on the same day, at 9:26 AM, Ashley had written, \u201cWe are still pending a statement to finalize our liability,\u201d indicating that West Bend had not yet received a statement required to finalize the liability decision.\n\nThe sequence continued into November 30, 2022. At 8:43 AM, Ashley reiterated that they were still pending a statement to finalize the liability. Shortly thereafter, at 9:26 AM, there was another indication that the liability decision remained pending. Then, at 9:43 AM, Ashley directed that Ryan Gorlick RGorlick@wbmi.com, who was handling the liability and property portion of the claim, be contacted for this matter.\n\nIn response, at 9:45 AM, Sarena addressed Ashley (and referenced Ryan) with the note: \u201cThank you Ashley, Good morning Ryan. Ashley has advised your office is still pending a statement in order to make a liability decision, can you please clarify whose statement you are awaiting? We are approaching 3 weeks without a decision.\u201d This message was sent with Sarena\u2019s signature block, underscoring her role at The Whaley Law Firm and her contact information, including the reminder to note the new email address. Her signature again listed The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville address, D and O phone lines, and email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the core facts remained: Muhammad Alif\u2019s claim AP92071 was under liability consideration by West Bend Mutual Insurance, with Ryan Gorlick identified as the individual handling the liability and property aspects; West Bend sought a firm W-9 to finalize system access; Sarena Tuttle provided a W-9 and consistent reminders to discuss the liability decision; and there was ongoing confusion or clarification needed about which party\u2019s statement was still outstanding to complete the liability determination. The communications spanned November 22 through November 30, 2022, and the parties repeatedly referenced the pending liability decision and the need for a completed statement to move forward.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This matter concerns an external claim, AP92071, in which Muhammad Alif is represented by The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe correspondence began with an exchange on November 22, 2022, when Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Ashley Becerra, a Senior Claims Representative with West Bend Mutual Insurance, regarding the letter of representation. Sarena noted she had reviewed the document and was not sure why UM/UIM language had been inserted there and attached an updated letter of representation for Ashley\u2019s file. The message included Sarena\u2019s contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note that the email address is the new one.\n\nOn November 28, 2022 at 3:18 PM, Ashley replied requesting a W-9 so West Bend could add The Whaley Law Firm to their system: \u201cCan you please send me a W-9 so I can have your firm added to our system.\u201d\n\nThe following day, November 29, 2022, at 9:45 AM, Sarena responded: \u201cPlease find the W-9 attached. Please contact our office to discuss your liability decision as soon as possible.\u201d The message indicated the W-9 was being provided and urged prompt discussion of the liability decision. Later on the same day, at 10:10 AM, Ashley replied: \u201cPlease forward me a W-9 so I can have your firm added to our system,\u201d confirming the need to receive the W-9 to complete the setup.\n\nOn November 29, 2022 at 9:45 AM, there is also confirmation within the thread that the W-9 had been attached. The exchange shows that West Bend was coordinating the W-9 submission to finalize their records.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, the thread shows ongoing questions about the status of liability information. At 8:43 AM, Sarena wrote: \u201cCan you please clarify whose statement you are still pending?\u201d In response, at 9:26 AM, Ashley stated: \u201cWe are still pending a statement to finalize our liability.\u201d Later that same day, at 9:43 AM, Ashley added: \u201cPlease contact Ryan Gorlick RGorlick@wbmi.com who is handling the liability and property portion of the claim.\u201d Then, at 9:45 AM, Sarena wrote: \u201cThank you Ashley, Good morning Ryan. Ashley has advised your office is still pending a statement in order to make a liability decision, can you please clarify whose statement you are awaiting? We are approaching 3 weeks without a decision.\u201d This final note reflects the impression that a liability decision had not yet been reached, approximately three weeks into the process.\n\nConcurrent with the November 30 exchanges, there was a delivery notification from postmaster@wbmi.com, indicating that the email address provided for Ryan could not be reached. The message stated: \u201cDelivery has failed to these recipients or groups: RGorlick@wbmi.com. The email address you entered couldn't be found. Please check the recipient's email address and try to resend the message. If the problem continues, please contact your email admin.\u201d This bounce was received at 9:45 AM (2 minutes after the initial message referenced).\n\nThroughout these communications, the signature blocks consistently identified Sarena M. Tuttle and The Whaley Law Firm, with their Louisville address and contact details, and the West Bend Mutual Insurance representatives, including Ashley Becerra\u2019s role and contact information. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office contact details remained on record as The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address as a new email). Ashley Becerra\u2019s information included her title as Senior Claims Representative, Casualty Claims at West Bend Mutual Insurance, with the office address at 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095, phone numbers, and her email abecerra@wbmi.com.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects an active effort to obtain a statement to finalize liability, the sending of a W-9 to enable system updates, and ongoing questions about which party\u2019s statement is being awaited, all within the context of a pending liability decision for claim AP92071 on behalf of Muhammad Alif. A delivery failure to reach Ryan Gorlick\u2019s address is also noted in the same thread.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif, and the matter concerns an external claim, AP92071, referenced in correspondence between The Whaley Law Firm and West Bend Mutual Insurance (West Bend Specialty).\n\nThe first documented exchange occurs on November 22, 2022. Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222 (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS), wrote to Ashley Becerra of West Bend Mutual Insurance (West Bend Specialty) after a call regarding the letter of representation. Sarena stated she had reviewed the LOR and was unsure why UM/UIM language had been inserted, and she attached an updated LOR for the file.\n\nOn November 28, 2022 at 3:18 PM, Ashley responded requesting that Sarena send a W-9 so her firm could be added to West Bend\u2019s system.\n\nOn November 29, 2022, Sarena replied at 9:45 AM with the W-9 attached and asked Ashley to contact their office to discuss the liability decision as soon as possible. At 10:10 AM that same day, Ashley replied: \u201cPlease forward me a W-9 so I can have your firm added to our system.\u201d\n\nAlso on November 29, 2022, there is a record of correspondence indicating ongoing steps to finalize the claim and liability discussions, though the thread shows a focus on obtaining the W-9 and clarifying liability decisions.\n\nOn November 30, 2022, multiple messages circulated regarding pending liability statements. At 8:43 AM, Sarena asked Ashley to clarify whose statement was still pending. At 9:26 AM, Ashley replied that West Bend was still pending a statement to finalize their liability. At 9:43 AM, Sarena again asked to clarify whose statement was still pending. At 9:45 AM, Ashley directed Sarena to contact Ryan Gorlick RGorlick@wbmi.com, who was handling the liability and property portion of the claim. In the same 9:45 AM window, Sarena noted that she had received a \u201ckickback\u201d from the email address provided for Ryan\u2014the postmaster message indicated that delivery had failed to RGorlick@wbmi.com and that the email address could not be found; she urged checking the recipient\u2019s email address and retrying, adding that the problem should be addressed with the email administrator.\n\nIn addition, there was an interim adjustment to contact details: Ashley\u2019s note at 14:55:27 UTC on November 30, 2022 stated, \u201cSorry try this email rgorelick@wbmi.com.\u201d This appears to be an attempt to correct Ryan Gorlick\u2019s contact address after the delivery failure to RGorlick@wbmi.com. Throughout the thread, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s signature also reflects their updated contact information, including Sarena\u2019s email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the parenthetical reminder: \u201c(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\u201d\n\nThe thread also records the following operational details: West Bend provided Ashley Becerra\u2019s contact information\u2014Senior Claims Representative, Casualty Claims, West Bend Specialty, West Bend Mutual Insurance, 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095; Toll Free 800.760.9250 Ext 3631; Ph: 608-410-3631; Fx: 877-434-9585; Email: abecerra@wbmi.com. Ryan Gorlick\u2019s address (RGorlick@wbmi.com) and the attempted alternative address (rgorelick@wbmi.com) are also reflected in the exchanges, with the latter appearing within Ashley\u2019s 14:55 update as the suggested contact.\n\nIn summary, the communication history spans November 22 to November 30, 2022, and centers on updating the letter of representation for Muhammad Alif in claim AP92071, obtaining a W-9 from The Whaley Law Firm to add them to West Bend\u2019s system, and resolving the liability decision with the appropriate West Bend contacts. There were also email delivery issues regarding contacting Ryan Gorlick, prompting a subsequent address adjustment to rgorelick@wbmi.com.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nRe: [External] Claim: AP92071 - Muhammad Alif\n\nOverview\nThis matter involves the Whaley Law Firm representing Muhammad Alif in connection with an external claim, AP92071, related to a motor vehicle accident on November 8, 2022. The communications center on coordinating a liability decision and securing necessary representation documents, with West Bend Mutual Insurance (West Bend) handling liability and property portions of the claim and Ryan Gorlick (RGorlick@wbmi.com) involved in the liability decision process. Throughout the exchanges, the focus is on obtaining a pending liability statement necessary to finalize the liability determination and on ensuring the claims file is properly updated with the required W-9 information.\n\nChronology of communications\n\n- November 22, 2022: Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Ashley Becerra regarding the letter of representation (LOR). Sarena noted that she had reviewed the document and was unsure why UM/UIM language had been inserted, and she attached an updated LOR for West Bend\u2019s file. The message included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details and stated that the updated LOR was attached for the file.\n\n- November 28, 2022, 3:18 PM: Ashley Becerra of West Bend Mutual Insurance requested that The Whaley Law Firm forward a W-9 so the firm could be added to West Bend\u2019s system.\n\n- November 29, 2022, 9:45 AM: Sarena Tuttle replied, asking West Bend to contact their office to discuss the liability decision as soon as possible. She stated that a W-9 was attached in her previous message and reiterated the request to discuss the liability decision. She again provided the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and noted the new email address.\n\n- November 29, 2022, 10:10 AM: Ashley Becerra emailed again, requesting that the W-9 be forwarded so the firm could be added to West Bend\u2019s system.\n\n- November 29, 2022, 9:45 AM (sequence noted in the thread): The message from Sarena about the W-9 was circulated in the same day\u2019s thread, indicating that the W-9 had been attached and urging discussion of the liability decision.\n\n- November 29\u201330, 2022: Ongoing correspondence about the W-9 and the liability decision continued to appear in the thread. The West Bend side repeatedly indicated that a liability statement was outstanding, needed to finalize liability, and requested the appropriate representation and contact details. West Bend\u2019s messages also included directions to contact Ryan Gorlick, who handles the liability and property portions of the claim.\n\n- November 30, 2022, 9:43 AM: Ashley Becerra instructed contacting Ryan Gorlick (RGorlick@wbmi.com), who was handling the liability and property portions of the claim.\n\n- November 30, 2022, 9:55 AM: Ashley Becerra reiterated the instruction to contact Ryan Gorlick, and Sarena asked for clarification about whose statement West Bend was awaiting. She noted they were approaching three weeks without a liability decision.\n\n- November 30, 2022, 10:06 AM: Sarena Tuttle sent a follow-up, addressing Ashley and Ryan. She confirmed that Ashley had advised that the office was still pending a statement to make a liability decision and asked for clarification on whose statement was being awaited. She again stated that they were approaching three weeks without a decision and provided her contact details, including that her email address is the new one (Please note new email address).\n\n- November 30, 2022, 9:45 AM (bounce notice): A delivery bounce occurred when attempting to email RGorlick@wbmi.com via postmaster@wbmi.com, indicating that the email address could not be found. A message stated: \u201cDelivery has failed to these recipients or groups: RGorlick@wbmi.com. The email address you entered couldn't be found.\u201d The bounce was documented with Sarena\u2019s contact information and the note to try again or contact the email admin if the problem continued, with the signature indicating the new email address.\n\nAdditional details\n- Throughout the thread, the subject remained: [External]Claim: AP92071 - Muhammad Alif.\n- The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details are consistently listed as: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d\n- West Bend Mutual Insurance\u2019s contact details appear as: 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095; toll-free 800-760-9250 Ext 3631; phone 608-410-3631; fax 877-434-9585; email abecerra@wbmi.com. The thread indicates that Ryan Gorlick is the point of contact for liability and property portions of the claim.\n\nIn summary, the case involves ongoing efforts by The Whaley Law Firm to obtain a liability decision for Muhammad Alif in the AP92071 claim, with a request for a signed statement to finalize liability. The communications show an effort to obtain a W-9 for system updates, attempts to reach Ryan Gorlick at West Bend, and repeated inquiries about which statement is pending. A bounce on the Ryan Gorlick email indicated misaddressing or an unavailable recipient, complicating the process. The thread repeatedly references the need for a liability decision and clarifies the parties involved and their contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nIn a December 6, 2022 email concerning Claim AP92071 for Muhammad Alif, Ryan Gorelick, Claims Representative III for Property & Casualty at West Bend Specialty (West Bend Mutual Insurance Company), advised Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm that West Bend had accepted 100% liability on the claim for Mr. Alif. He also stated that he had informed Farmers Insurance that he was handling the property-damage portion of the claim and asked Sarena to advise if there were any other questions. The email included Gorelick\u2019s contact details: West Bend Mutual Insurance Company, 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095; phone 608-410-3278 or 800-760-9250, Ext. 3278; email rgorelick@wbmi.com. The message was sent to Sarena Tuttle and CC\u2019d Ashley Becerra.\n\nLeading up to that update, a series of emails began in November 2022 concerning the liability decision and statements. On November 22, 2022 at 3:03 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) wrote to Ashley Becerra regarding the letter of representation (LOR). She indicated she had reviewed the document and was not sure why the UM/UIM language had been inserted, and she attached an updated LOR for the file. Her new email address was noted as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact numbers.\n\nIn the days that followed, West Bend repeatedly requested a W-9 to add The Whaley Law Firm to their system. On November 28, 2022 at 3:18 PM, Ashley Becerra asked Sarena to send a W-9 so her office could add the firm to their system. On November 29, 2022 at 9:45 AM, Sarena replied that she had attached the W-9 and requested that Ashley contact their office to discuss the liability decision as soon as possible. At 10:10 AM on November 29, 2022, Ashley responded that she needed the W-9 forwarded so she could have The Whaley Law Firm added to West Bend\u2019s system. Earlier that same day, Sarena had requested the W-9 again and noted the attachment.\n\nMessages on November 30, 2022 show ongoing communication about the liability decision and the correct contact details. At 8:43 AM, Ashley asked Sarena to clarify whose statement West Bend was still awaiting. Shortly thereafter, at 8:48 AM, Sarena reported that she had received a \u201ckickback\u201d from the email address provided for Ryan (Ryan Gorelick) and that postmaster@wbmi.com had bounced the message, with RGorlick@wbmi.com being the intended recipient. Sarena\u2019s signature included her firm information and note about a new email address. At 9:26 AM, Ashley stated that they were still pending a statement to finalize their liability decision, and at 9:43 AM she reiterated that Ryan Gorlick (RGorlick@wbmi.com) was the one handling the liability and property portions of the claim. By 9:45 AM, Sarena again thanked Ashley and asked for clarification on whose statement was still pending, reiterating the need for a liability decision. A later entry at 9:55 AM showed Ashley replying with a corrected email address for Ryan: rgorelick@wbmi.com, and the message included Ashley\u2019s full West Bend contact details.\n\nTaken together, these communications show the following: The case involved a claim identified as AP92071 for Muhammad Alif arising from a motor vehicle incident on November 8, 2022 (MVA). On December 6, 2022, West Bend accepted 100% liability for Mr. Alif and notified Farmers Insurance that the PD portion of the claim was being handled by West Bend. A prior, multi-day email thread (November 22\u201330, 2022) between The Whaley Law Firm and West Bend\u2019s Casualty Claims personnel revolved around the appropriate representation and liability decision, including discussions about updating the letter of representation due to UM/UIM language, requests for a W-9 to add The Whaley Law Firm to West Bend\u2019s system, and ongoing clarification about which party\u2019s statement was needed to finalize liability. The emails document efforts to coordinate representation, confirm liability status, resolve contact/address issues, and ensure the correct points of contact were used.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 involves client Muhammad Alif. On January 9, 2023, at 12:39:54 PM Eastern, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Nona Bacote, with CCs to stimulus110@yahoo.com, Justin Chumbley [stimulus110@yahoo.com]m.com, and Aaron Whaley, thanking Ms. Bacote for the detailed email. She stated that, at this time, the firm would handle obtaining all required documentation and that there is nothing the client needs to do except focus on getting better. The firm had already requested the New York Police Report and had set up the claims from Muhammad Alif\u2019s first accident. Their Medical Records Clerk would work on obtaining the medical records, and they asked that the client keep them posted about any new providers not already listed in the email. Regarding travel to appointments, the firm would need verification of those expenses and requested receipts; they also reminded the client that Kentucky has a travel reimbursement statute that will determine the reimbursable amount. Tuttle concluded by inviting any questions and provided her direct contact information, including a note to use her new email address.\n\nEarlier that day, at 11:02 AM, Nona Bacote wrote back with a detailed request for records and bills. She asked that all records and bills be requested from Park Ridge Medical Center for the first accident on October 8, 2022. The account number is #F00116787480, it is under Muhammad Alif, and the insurance company is Farmers Insurance Company; the claim number is 700528477781. For the second accident that occurred in New York, she named American Transit Insurance Company as the insurer and provided the case number 1123215, requesting all records and bills from Norton Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky. She noted that Legions Orthopedic Hospital, third floor Cutting Edge Orthopedic Services, had treated her for both the first and second accidents and provided the address: 1401 E. Trinity Mills Road, Carollton, Texas 75006, with Gabe as the contact at (972) 978-2525. Dr. Steven Patton at Norton Hospital referred her to Kort Partners in Physical Therapy, located at 616 Executive Park, Louisville, Kentucky, with phone number (502) 896-9355. She mentioned an MRI with Innovative Open MRI of Central Florida for the first accident. Dr. Steven Abro of Annotating Hands was listed with contact (212) 857-8200 and the note \u201cPixie Highway Cervical.\u201d She said she was waiting on the police report for the New York accident and requested that the New York accident report be requested, ensuring all police statements and witnesses reports from both accidents are included. She stated she is seeing Dr. Mark Lynn as a specialist for the first accident, at Lynn Family Sports Vision & Training LLC, 801 Edith Road, Louisville, Kentucky 40206, with phone number (502) 308-5966. She emphasized that all PIP forms must be completely filled out for insurance compliance, and again requested copies of all police statements and witnesses reports from both accidents. She also wanted to know who the insurance adjusters are for both accidents and the policy limits, and asked to be mindful of traveling back and forth to appointments. She specified that attorney release benefits should only go to Starlite Chiropractic, LLC at starlightchrio@gmail.com and Annotating Hands. She closed with gratitude to Aaron Whaley for his support as a friend and advisor, stating that she is hurt and needs action taken right away, signing as Muhammand Alif.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nOn January 16, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent Muhammad Alif an email with the subject line related to documents you requested. In that message, she informed Mr. Alif that she attached the letters of representation he had requested and that she had included all correspondence to date from both his Personal Injury Protection (PIP) claim with Farmers and his Bodily Injury claim with West Bend. The note also included the firm\u2019s contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a parenthetical reminder to note the new email address.\n\nIn the same message, Sarena conveyed a separate update from Ryan Gorelick, a Claims Representative III for West Bend Specialty, about liability on the claim. Ryan stated that they had accepted 100% liability on the claim for Mr. Alif and that he had informed Farmers Insurance of the acceptance in relation to the property damage (PD) portion he was handling. His contact details were listed as West Bend Mutual Insurance Company, 1900 South 18th Avenue, West Bend, WI 53095; phone 608-410-3278 or 800-760-9250, ext. 3278; email rgorelick@wbmi.com.\n\nA lengthy email thread from late November 2022 documents ongoing discussions about liability decisions and the need for certain statements. On November 22, 2022 at 3:03 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Ashley Becerra and Ryan Gorelick with a note regarding the letter of representation and the UM/UIM language she believed had been inserted erroneously; she attached an updated LOR for the file. The Whaley Law Firm again provided its contact details in that message.\n\nDuring the week of November 28\u201330, 2022, West Bend repeatedly requested a W-9 form so that the firm could be added to West Bend\u2019s system. On November 28, 2022 at 3:18 PM, Ashley Becerra asked Sarena to send a W-9. On November 29, 2022 at 9:45 AM, Sarena replied with the W-9 attached and asked Ashley to contact their office to discuss the liability decision as soon as possible. Later that day at 10:10 AM, Ashley responded by asking Sarena to forward the W-9 so she could add The Whaley Law Firm to West Bend\u2019s system.\n\nAdditionally, Sarena reported that she had received a \u201ckickback\u201d from the email address provided for Ryan Gorelick, noting a delivery failure to RGorlick@wbmi.com from the postmaster address postmaster@wbmi.com. In the series of messages on November 30, 2022, a sequence of inquiries and replies followed regarding whose statement West Bend was still awaiting to finalize the liability decision. At 8:43 AM, Sarena requested clarification on whose statement was still pending. At 8:48 AM, she noted the delivery issue with Ryan\u2019s address. Throughout the morning of November 30, 2022, multiple messages were exchanged reiterating that West Bend was still awaiting a liability statement and referencing the need to contact Ryan Gorlick at the correct address. Ashley\u2019s reply on November 30, 2022 at 9:43 AM directed contacts to RGorlick@wbmi.com for the liability and property portions of the claim, and Sarena reiterated the question about which statement was pending in follow-up messages around 9:45\u20139:55 AM. Earlier that day, Ashley\u2019s earlier message had advised using RGorlick@wbmi.com, after an initial delivery issue to the previously provided address.\n\nIn summary, the November 2022 correspondence centers on West Bend\u2019s request for a W-9 to add The Whaley Law Firm to their system, the exchange of updated letters of representation (notably correcting UM/UIM language), and ongoing requests for a liability statement\u2014specifically identifying Ryan Gorlick as the contact handling the liability and property portions of AP92071 for Muhammad Alif. By contrast, the January 16, 2023 communication confirms that all requested documents had been compiled and sent to Mr. Alif, including letters of representation and the full set of correspondence on the Farmers PIP claim and the West Bend bodily injury claim, with confirmation that there is new contact information for Sarena Tuttle. The case remains identified as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022, with the client being Muhammad Alif.",

The sender, Sarena M.

She also commented that Mo appears to believe he will receive over a million dollars, which she says is not the case, noting he has already incurred more than $50,000 in basic chiropractic care and imaging. She stated that a sit-down had occurred the previous day and expressed a need for a reality check on how the case would unfold.

      "natural_language": "Case Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 concerns the client Muhammad Alif, who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 8, 2022. The matter titled \u201cRe: Full battery Brain Testing Approval\u201d was discussed in communications dated January 24, 2023.\n\nOn January 24, 2023, the email thread shows that the case involves PIP coverage for Muhammad Alif with the same information as that used for Kendra Fogle, as well as PIP for the accident date of 11/08/22. The Farmers Insurance policy number is 7005284778-1-2, and the adjuster is Michael Santos, who can be reached at 248-488-2779.\n\nEarlier that day, at 5:22 PM, Cutting Edge Front Desk emailed a request for approval of traumatic brain injury (TBI) testing for MUHAMMED ALIF, who is a patient of Dr. William Hwang, MD. Dr. Hwang is double board-certified in neurology and psychiatry, with specialties in physical medicine, rehab, and sleep disorders. The desk note states that Dr. Hwang recommends the following procedures before treatment: Oculomotor assessment, Posturography, Neurocognitive testing, Brain Mapping, and MRI/DTI.\n\nThe TBI testing battery proposed includes the following components and costs: Oculomotor assessment at $2,000; Neurocognitive testing at $2,200; Posturography in this battery at $500; Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology at $8,000; and DTI/MRI at $8,000. The desk notice also invites learnings about multifactorial testing by directing the recipient to http://meet.ceostx.com to schedule time with Dr. Matt DeGaetano, and provides Dr. Matt DeGaetano\u2019s direct contact as drmatt@ceostx.com.\n\nIndications provided for each test are as follows:\n- Oculomotor assessment: indications include brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision, foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, mood changes, blurred or double vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, and lightheadedness.\n- Posturography: indications include brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, and lightheadedness.\n- Neurocognitive testing: helps identify the brain areas impacted by a TBI and how impairments affect day-to-day functioning; it also clarifies how factors such as depression, anxiety, life stress, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress influence cognitive functioning.\n- Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: described as the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available, enabling visualization of live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously; brain dysfunction can have various causes (encephalopathy), including memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline.\n- DTI/MRI: diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain, with fiber tractography (FT) as a 3D reconstruction to assess neural tracts; a non-invasive imaging tool to investigate white matter structure damaged during a TBI even in the absence of neurological symptoms.\n\nThe desk message concluded by requesting a response accepting or denying the testing, and asked that an LOP (letter of protection) be attached if the testing is approved.\n\nThe thread closing shows that at 6:00 PM on January 24, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied, \u201cYes, I approve.\u201d The header of the original message is dated January 24, 2023, at 18:05:24 -0500, reflecting the same day approval in the thread.\n\nSignature:\nAaron Whaley\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222\nPhone: 502-583-4022",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This note documents communications related to Muhammad Alif\u2019s motor vehicle accident case (MVA) and related insurance matters, including a second accident, a request for police reports, and imaging arrangements.\n\nOn January 26, 2023, at 7:18 PM, Nona Bacote sent an email to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm regarding Muhammad Alif. In her message, Nona advised that Muhammad had been seen by Envision Imaging that week at 12201 Merit Drive, Suite 100, Dallas, Texas 75251, with phone number (214) 276-0050 and fax number (214) 276-0057. The email address listed was http://www.envivionimg.com. Nona stated that Envision Imaging ordered an MRI, but the services were refused due to Muhammad\u2019s claustrophobia. She also mentioned that she had obtained the police report for Muhammad\u2019s accident in New York and asked for clarification about the accident and whether Progressive Insurance Company had been identified as the insurer. The message concluded with Muhammad\u2019s name and contact details and was signed by Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of 502-583-4022.\n\nThe next day, January 27, 2023, at 9:28 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded to Muhammad\u2019s matter. She wrote that they had been in contact with Progressive and that Progressive does not insure the defendant in Muhammad\u2019s second accident. She explained that the only coverage currently available was for the cab company, which carries a $25,000/$50,000 policy. She cautioned Muhammad that because the cab was not the at-fault driver, the cab company has the right to deny all liability, accept 50% liability, or accept 100% liability. If Progressive accepts 100% liability, the maximum recovery from that source would be $25,000. She also asked Muhammad whether he had under-insured motorist coverage on his personal policy.\n\nAlso on January 27, 2023, at 9:54 AM, Aaron Whaley replied to Sarena\u2019s message, indicating he had asked Muhammad to forward the police report. The thread shows his request to obtain the police report for the case.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:56 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote again. She noted that she had Muhammad\u2019s copy of the police report (referred to as the PR) and that Star faxed it over.\n\nFinally, at 6:51 PM (UTC) on January 27, 2023, Muhammad Alif sent an email from stimulus110@yahoo.com to Sarena Tuttle and Aaron Whaley, CC\u2019ing Nona Bacote. In his message, Muhammad stated: \u201cGood afternoon after reviewing my policy it\u2019s been discovered I only had $25,000 on a sewer motors.\u201d The message was sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone.\n\nThe thread includes the Whaley Law Firm signatures. Sarena M. Tuttle\u2019s signature identifies her with The Whaley Law Firm, at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971, office number 502-583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a newer email address). Aaron Whaley\u2019s signature likewise reflects The Whaley Law Firm and lists the same Louisville contact details.\n\nIn summary, the communications establish that Muhammad Alif\u2019s case involves a motor vehicle accident with a second involved incident, Progressive Insurance\u2019s lack of coverage for the defendant in the second accident (leaving the cab company\u2019s $25k/$50k policy as the only available coverage), questions about under-insured motorist coverage on Muhammad\u2019s own policy, and an imaging order from Envision Imaging in Dallas that was not fulfilled due to claustrophobia. Muhammad also obtained a police report for the New York accident and sought confirmation that Progressive Insurance Company is the insurer for the matter.",

Dr. Hwang recommends the following procedures: Oculomotor assessment, Posturography, Neurocognitive testing, Brain Mapping, and MRI/DTI prior to treatment. These tests are performed to better identify traumatic brain injury. The TBI battery includes: Oculomotor assessment - $2,000\n Neurocognitive testing - $2,200\n Posturography this battery - $500\n Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology - $8,000\n The DTI/MRI - $8,000\n If you would like to learn more about how multifactorial testing is beneficial for identifying brain injuries please click the following link (http://meet.ceostx.com) to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano.

More importantly, testing can also determine how other factors (e.g. depression, anxiety, life stress) are impacting your cognitive functioning, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available. Visualize live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously. Brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes (encephalopathy), memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline. DTI/MRI: Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain. Fiber tractography (FT) is a 3D reconstruction technique to assess neural tracts using data collected by diffusion tensor imaging.

Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nIn the submission titled MUHAMMED ALIF Brain Testing Approval, dated January 31, 2023, Cutting Edge Admin sent a message to MUHAMMED ALIF (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) regarding the brain testing needed for Muhammad Alif, a patient of Dr. William Hwang, MD, who is double board-certified in neurology and psychiatry and has specialties in physical medicine, rehabilitation, and sleep disorders. The message requests approval for traumatic brain injury (TBI) testing and outlines the procedures Dr. Hwang recommends prior to treatment: an oculomotor assessment, posturography, neurocognitive testing, brain mapping, and MRI/DTI.\n\nThe TBI testing battery and their listed costs are as follows: oculomotor assessment ($2,000), neurocognitive testing ($2,200), posturography ($500), brain mapping and electrophysiology ($8,000), and DTI/MRI ($8,000). The note invites the recipient to learn more about how multifactorial testing can identify brain injuries by scheduling time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano via http://meet.ceostx.com; if a time cannot be found or if direct contact is preferred, Dr. DeGaetano can be reached at drmatt@ceostx.com.\n\nIndications for each component are detailed. Oculomotor assessment is indicated for brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision and foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, and mood changes, as well as blurred vision, double vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, and lightheadedness. Posturography is indicated for brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, and lightheadedness. Neurocognitive testing can help determine the brain areas affected by TBI and how these impairments impact day-to-day functioning; it can also reveal how other factors such as depression, anxiety, and life stress influence cognitive functioning, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology is described as the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available, enabling visualization of live activity in regions such as the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, and Brodmann areas by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously, with brain dysfunction having a variety of possible causes (encephalopathy) and associations with memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, and cognitive decline.

The message notes that additional information about how multifactorial testing can benefit the identification of brain injuries is available by visiting http://meet.ceostx.com to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano; if scheduling is difficult, or if there is a preference to speak with him directly, contact can be made at drmatt@ceostx.com.\n\nIndications for the tests are detailed as follows: Oculomotor assessment is indicated for brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision, foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, mood changes, blurred vision, double vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensations, and lightheadedness. Posturography is indicated for brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensations, and lightheadedness. Neurocognitive testing can help determine the brain areas affected by a TBI and how these impairments impact day-to-day functioning, and it can also evaluate how other factors such as depression, anxiety, and life stress influence cognitive functioning, memory loss, concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology is described as the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available, allowing visualization of live activity in regions such as the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, and Brodmann areas by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously; brain dysfunction can have various causes (encephalopathy) and can manifest as memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, and cognitive decline. DTI/MRI is explained as diffusion tensor imaging, an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain; fiber tractography is a 3D reconstruction technique to assess neural tracts using DTI data. It is a non-invasive medical imaging tool used to investigate white matter structure damaged during a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) even in the absence of neurological symptoms.\n\nPlease reply back with acceptance or denial of the testing requests, and attach a Letter of Protection (LOP) if testing is approved.",

      "natural_language": "Case Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 concerns client Muhammad Alif. In an email thread dated January 31, 2023, Cutting Edge Admin requested approval for traumatic brain injury (TBI) testing for MUHAMMED ALIF, who is a patient of Dr. William Hwang, MD, described as double board-certified in neurology and psychiatry, with specialties in physical medicine, rehabilitation, and sleep disorders. Dr. Hwang recommended a testing battery including an oculomotor assessment, posturography, neurocognitive testing, brain mapping, and MRI/DTI prior to treatment in order to better identify a traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe requested TBI battery was itemized with the following components and fees: Oculomotor assessment for $2,000; Neurocognitive testing for $2,200; Posturography for $500; Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology for $8,000; and DTI/MRI for $8,000. Indications were provided for each test: the oculomotor assessment is indicated for brain injury symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, blurry or double vision, foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, mood changes, as well as blurred or nausea and dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensations, and lightheadedness. Posturography is indicated for brain injury with dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensations, and lightheadedness.\n\nNeurocognitive testing was described as a means to determine the brain areas affected by TBI and how impairments impact day-to-day functioning, while also assessing how other factors such as depression, anxiety, and life stress influence cognitive functioning, memory, concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology were described as the most sophisticated, real-time imaging and brain training available, enabling visualization of live activity in regions including the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, and Brodmann areas by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously, with brain dysfunction potentially arising from various causes (encephalopathy) and presenting as memory loss, difficulty concentrating, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, and cognitive decline. DTI/MRI was explained as diffusion tensor imaging that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain, with fiber tractography providing a 3D reconstruction to assess neural tracts, and described as a non-invasive imaging tool to investigate white matter damaged during TBI even in the absence of neurological symptoms. The request concluded with a directive to reply accepting or denying the requests and to attach a Letter of Protection (LOP) if testing is approved.\n\nIn response, on February 1, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, Louisville, KY, replied that the treatment had been approved by the attorney. She stated that the firm could not send a letter of protection or make agreements that may not be in the best interest of their client. However, she noted that the billing for the testing would be included in all damages presented for consideration at the time of negotiations.

On Wednesday, February 8, 2023, he is scheduled to go to Mayo Clinic in Rod Chester, New York for further medical treatment. Farmers Insurance is the insurance company for this accident only; all bills should be sent to them for payment from the treatment centers listed above. He is also requesting policy limits immediately from Farmers.\n\nRegarding the second accident, on December 9, 2023 he was in a second accident in New York, where he was in a cab that was rear-ended by another automobile. He has only been seen for medical treatment by Cutting Edge and Starlite Chiropractor. For this second incident, he notes that he does have uninsured motorist insurance. He concludes by acknowledging that this is a lot of information and asks to be told if it is too much for the recipient to handle, requesting a prompt response if possible.\n\nSincerely,\nMuhamad Alif",

She stated that all medical records and bills had been requested and were being awaited, and that providers have a minimum of 30 days to produce these documents. The client expressed a desire for policy limits and PIP to be released to Starlite. Sarena explained that insurance companies are not required to disclose policy limits prior to a demand, and a demand cannot be submitted until all medical bills and records are received. She also explained that Aaron typically reviews the medical bills before releasing PIP payments, as he determines who receives what portion of the available benefits. He cannot release all benefits to a single provider when there are multiple providers and roughly $30,000 outstanding between two of them. She advised that she had forwarded this information to him for review, along with the statement that a civil suit is being \u201cfollowing\u201d or \u201cfiled\u201d on the client\u2019s behalf, and that he would reach out to discuss the matter further.\n\nOn the same date, February 6, 2023 at 11:54 AM, Nona Bacote replied to Serena to clarify the client\u2019s medical treatment in relation to the two accidents.\n\nShe stated that in the first accident, on November 8, 2023, the client received treatment at Parkridge Medical Center and subsequently received additional care from the following providers, listed in the order below: Norton Health Care (2nd), Cutting Edge (3rd), Anointed Hands (4th), Mark Lynn (5th), and Kort Physical Therapy (6th).

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. The matter centers on two motor vehicle accidents and the medical treatment tied to them.\n\nIn an email thread dated February 6, 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm asked Sarena Tuttle to clarify which accident Muhammad Alif treated for at Starlite, querying whether the facility was Stalite, Modern, or Tri-State Injury. He stated that he believed the first accident involved a traumatic brain injury (TBI) only, while the second involved a neck and back injury.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied later that same day, explaining that all of Muhammad Alif\u2019s providers are documented and that records and bills have been requested and are awaiting receipt. Providers have a minimum of 30 days to produce these documents. She noted that policy limits and PIP information cannot be released to Starlite prior to submitting a demand, which cannot be submitted until all medical bills and records are received. She added that Aaron typically waits to review medical bills before releasing PIP payments so he can determine how the available benefits should be allocated among multiple providers, especially since over $30,000 had already been incurred between two of them. She indicated she had forwarded this information to him for review, along with the statement that a civil suit was being \u201cfollowing\u201d or \u201cfiled\u201d on Muhammad Alif\u2019s behalf, and that he would reach out to discuss the matter further.\n\nEarlier that day, Nona Bacote had sent a separate message seeking clarification of Muhammad Alif\u2019s medical treatment related to the two accidents. She stated that, on November 8, 2023, Muhammad Alif was involved in his first accident and received treatment at Parkridge Medical Center, followed by care from Norton Health Care, Cutting Edge, Anointed Hands, Mark Lynn, and Kort Physical Therapy, in that order. All imaging had been performed at Innovative Open MRI & Imaging Diagnostic Imaging Center in Lake Mary, Florida, and he had a consultation with Aptiv. She noted that on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, he would be going to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, New York for additional treatment. Farmers Insurance was identified as the insurance company for this accident, and all bills were to be sent to them for payment from the listed treatment centers. She requested policy limits from Farmers immediately.\n\nBacote also stated that, on December 9, 2023, Muhammad Alif was involved in his second accident in New York, where his cab was rear-ended by another vehicle. He had been seen only by Cutting Edge and Starlite Chiropractor for medical treatment for this incident, and he had uninsured motorist insurance in relation to this claim. She acknowledged that the information was extensive and asked to be advised if it was too much to handle.\n\nThe email thread closes with Aaron Whaley\u2019s signature from Whaley Law Firm.",

Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent an email regarding Claim Review for PIP Release. The message was addressed to Nona Bacote, Tristateinjuryandrehab@gmail.com, and Muhammad Alif, with Aaron Whaley CC\u2019d.\n\nSarena explained that she had discussed the claims with Aaron, and he is okay with releasing PIP but requires clarification on which PIP to release and to whom. The firm can release either the PIP from the 11/08 accident, the PIP from the 12/09 accident, or both. She asked for specific instructions about which providers should receive the funds. If releasing PIP to a provider that served both accidents, such as Cutting Edge, she asked for further specification of which billing should be paid.\n\nShe noted that two providers are seeking payment: Starlite Chiro and Cutting Edge Medical Services. Gail advised that the billing for Starlite Chiro is over $10,000.00, though Gail is awaiting toner to print a billing statement for the client. For Cutting Edge Medical Services, she referenced an attached document. Between these two providers, they are currently claiming over $30,000.00 in medicals to date date. She also cautioned that there will possibly be outstanding medical bills to address at the negotiation or settlement of the claims.\n\nThe email closes with the expectation of receiving directions from the client.

Gail Sweasy, writing from tristateinjuryandrehab@gmail.com, informed Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm that Muhammad (\u201cMo\u201d) wants PIP released to pay Anointed Hands for the first wreck and Starlite for the second wreck, and that PIP should not be released for Cutting Edge yet.\n\nIn a prior reply dated February 6, 2023, Sarena Tuttle advised Mo after discussing the matter with Aaron. He was okay with releasing PIP but needed clarification on which PIP to release and to whom. The options were to release the PIP from the 11/08 accident, the PIP from the 12/09 accident, or both. Sarena requested that Mo specify which providers should receive the released funds. If the release benefits a provider that supplied services for both accidents, such as Cutting Edge, Mo should further specify which billing to pay.\n\nSarena reminded Mo that two providers are seeking payment: Starlite Chiro and Cutting Edge Medical Services. Gail had advised that Starlite\u2019s billing is over $10,000, though she is awaiting toner to print a billing statement. Cutting Edge Medical Services has stated billing of over $30,000 in medicals to date.

Can you please clarify which\nspeech pathologist you are referring to? Norton Community Hospital is not a\nproper location. Please provide the doctor's name and address.\n As we have discussed multiple times, we do not know the policy limits\nof your 1st accident and the insurance company is not required to disclose\nthis information.\n Also, we do not have a 'patient ledger' for your treatment to date. As\nadvised, we are still awaiting quite a few sets of medical records and\nbilling associated with your treatment and to our knowledge, no providers\nhave been paid to date. As far as the demand package, you will have to\nfollow up with Aaron on that. To my knowledge a Demand Package can not be\nsent until all medical records and bills have been obtained and you have\ncompleted treatment. I have, however, updated your bodily injury adjuster\nwith the medical records and bills that we do have on file but this is not\na formal demand and no offers were made based on the information provided.\nIf you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us to\ndiscuss them in further detail.\n\nSarena M.

Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm wrote to Nona Bacote regarding medical concerns. In her message, she thanked Muhammad for the appointment update and requested clarification on which speech pathologist was being referenced, noting that Norton Community Hospital is \u201cnot a proper location\u201d and asking for the doctor\u2019s name and address. She stated that, as discussed previously, they do not know the policy limits of the first accident and that the insurance company is not required to disclose this information. She added that they do not have a \u201cpatient ledger\u201d for treatment to date and that they are still awaiting several sets of medical records and billing related to the treatment, with no providers paid to date to her knowledge. Regarding the demand package, she instructed that Muhammad would need to follow up with Aaron, explaining that a Demand Package cannot be sent until all medical records and bills have been obtained and treatment has been completed. She noted that she had updated the bodily injury adjuster with the medical records and bills on file, but emphasized that this was not a formal demand and no offers were made based on the information provided. She closed by inviting Muhammad to contact them with any further questions. The signature block identified Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, marked as the new address.\n\nNona Bacote replied on the same day, February 13, 2023, at 7:53 a.m. She began, \u201cGood Morning Serena,\u201d and explained that she had an appointment on Friday with Dr. Steven Patton, who referred her to a speech pathologist at Norton Community Hospital regarding her speech, and that she was waiting for the appointment date. She acknowledged that Aaron had already started working on the demand package for settlement and requested that Aaron be informed that a life-care plan should be considered with the demand package for medical costs and projection of other health concerns as needed. She also stated that for her second accident, she would have three MRI\u2019s taken Tuesday in Lake Mary, Florida, as requested by Dr. William Hwang, MD, and that American Transit Insurance would be covering the bill. She noted that her team of doctors was very concerned about a life care planner for medical and rehabilitation care and asked who would pay for that associated cost if needed. Regarding both accidents, she asked whether any information had been obtained about policy limits and, if so, what those limits were for each accident. She also requested a patient ledger showing which doctors had been paid. The message concluded with her signature: \u201cThanks, Muhammad Alif.\u201d",

Dr. Hwang recommends the following procedures: Oculomotor assessment, Posturography, Neurocognitive testing, Brain Mapping, and MRI/DTI prior to treatment. These tests are performed to better identify traumatic brain injury. The TBI battery includes:Oculomotor assessment - $2,000Neurocognitive testing - $2,200Posturography this battery - $500Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology - $8,000The DTI/MRI - $8,000If you would like to learn more about how multifactorial testing is beneficial for identifying brain injuries please click the following link (http://meet.ceostx.com) to schedule a time to speak with Dr. Matt DeGaetano. If you are unable to find time or would like to speak with him directly please contact him at drmatt@ceostx.com Indications: Oculomotor assessment: brain injury, headaches, fatigue, blurry vision, foggy thinking, reading difficulties, cognitive challenges, balance issues, trouble sleeping, and mood changes blurred vision, double vision, nausea, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, lightheadedness Posturography: brain injury, dizziness, balance problems, unsteadiness, falls, vertigo, spinning sensation, lightheadedness Neurocognitive testing: can help determine the areas of the brain that are impacted by a TBI and how these impairments are impacting your day-to-day functioning. More importantly, testing can also determine how other factors (e.g. depression, anxiety, life stress) are impacting your cognitive functioning, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, anxiety, post-traumatic stress. Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology: the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging/brain training available. Visualize live activity in the Limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously. Brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes (encephalopathy), memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, cognitive decline. DTI/MRI: Diffusion tensor imaging is an MRI technique that uses anisotropic diffusion to estimate the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain. Fiber tractography (FT) is a 3D reconstruction technique to assess neural tracts using data collected by diffusion tensor imaging. A non-invasive medical imaging tool is used to investigate the structure of white matter that is damaged during a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) without any neurological symptoms\n ---Administration Axon Medical CentersDallas | Houston | San Antonio | El Paso | AustinPhone: 855-296-6824The information contained in this transmission may contain privileged and confidential information, including patient information protected by federal and state privacy laws.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nInitial client contact occurred on February 13, 2023, when Muhammad Alif emailed Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding a payment ledger from Farmers Insurance related to his motor vehicle accident dated November 8, 2022. In his message, he stated that he clearly understands who is being paid among the listed providers and asked whether the insurance company has been made aware of these bills. He also mentioned plans to see a speech pathologist and to send information about his neurologist and psychiatric treatment. Additionally, he noted that he has applied for health insurance and would have related information the next day. \n\nEarlier that same day, at 3:20 PM, Sarena replied to the thread explaining that the Payment Ledger is for his first accident and that what is listed reflects what the providers sent to Farmers. She provided her contact details and an updated email address, and she explained that the ledger had been attached along with a breakdown of payments. She listed the following: S&M Billing & Management \u2013 billed $6,090.00, paid $3,865.00; Innovation Open MRI \u2013 billed $3,200.00, paid $1,600.00; Lynn Family Vision & Training \u2013 billed $485.00, paid $485.00; Partners in Physical Therapy \u2013 billed $1,118.00, paid $838.00; Norton Leatherman Spine \u2013 billed $305.00, paid $305.00. In addition, ParkRidge East Hospital was billed $5,673.40; Radiology Alliance billed $458.00; Spring Creek Emergency Physicians billed $1,707.00; Modern Chiropractic billed $450.00; Mark Lynn & Associates billed $300.00; and Aptiva Health billed $1,475.00. The PIP Adjuster had applied $7,093.00 in payments as listed, leaving $14,168.40 in outstanding medical bills not including $25,213.45 for Cutting Edge, Lynn Family Vision, and the KORT Physical Therapy that had not yet been submitted to Farmers. She invited Muhammad to contact Aaron if he had questions about the information.\n\nAt 4:04 PM, Muhammad responded with thanks for the swift reply and sought clarification, asking whether all of these bills were for the first accident. He also noted that he would soon be released from chiropractic care, but he continued to experience head pain and memory loss related to the first accident and stressed the importance of following doctors\u2019 orders regarding treatment for his traumatic brain injury (TBI).\n\nAt 4:08 PM, Sarena replied with a brief confirmation: the payment ledger is for his first accident and reflects what the providers sent to Farmers. Her message also included her updated contact information, including a new email address: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS). The thread captures the ongoing discussion around the ledger, the 1st-accident billing, and the steps forward in addressing the claims and treatment needs.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nOn February 13, 2023, at 3:20 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm emailed Muhammad Alif regarding his PIP Payment Ledger. She stated that the ledger had been received in the mail, was attached, and listed the payments made by the PIP carrier. She noted that a $1,000 deductible was applied to the S&M Billing & Management invoices and that this would be discussed further during the negotiation phase of the claim. She provided a provider-by-provider breakdown: S&M Billing & Management billed $6,090.00 and was paid $3,865.00; Innovation Open MRI billed $3,200.00 and was paid $1,600.00; Lynn Family Vision & Training billed $485.00 and was paid $485.00; Partners in Physical Therapy billed $1,118.00 and was paid $838.00; Norton Leatherman Spine billed $305.00 and was paid $305.00. Additional bills listed included ParkRidge East Hospital ($5,673.40), Radiology Alliance ($458.00), Spring Creek Emergency Physicians ($1,707.00), Modern Chiropractic ($450.00), Mark Lynn & Associates ($300.00), and Aptiva Health ($1,475.00). She also noted that the PIP Adjuster had applied $7,093.00 in payments as listed, and that Muhammad currently has $14,168.40 in outstanding medical bills not including the $25,213.45 for Cutting Edge, Lynn Family Vision, and the KORT Physical Therapy that have not been submitted to Farmers at this time. She invited Muhammad to contact Aaron to discuss any questions in further detail and included her contact information and new email address.\n\nAt 4:04 PM the same day, Muhammad Alif replied to Serena, asking for clarification on whether all of these bills are for his first accident. He also mentioned that he would be released from chiropractic care very soon, but he continued to experience significant head pain and memory loss related to the first accident. He emphasized the importance of following doctors\u2019 orders for his traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment and added that he would be seeing a speech pathologist and would send information about his neurologist\u2019s psychiatric treatment. He also noted that he had applied for health insurance and would share that information the following day.\n\nAt 4:08 PM, Sarena responded to Muhammad, clarifying that the Payment Ledger is for his first accident and that what appeared on the ledger is exactly what the providers had sent to Farmers.\n\nLater that same day, at 6:23 PM, Muhammad replied again, stating that he understood which providers were being paid and asked whether the insurance company had been notified about these bills. He also reiterated that he would be seeing a speech pathologist and would provide information about his neurologist\u2019s psychiatric treatment. He again noted that he had applied for health insurance and would have that information tomorrow.\n\nOn February 14, 2023, at 11:00:12 AM (Eastern Time), Sarena M. Tuttle sent another update to Muhammad and the other recipients. She explained that the information came from Muhammad\u2019s PIP carrier, and that his BI carrier was aware of some\u2014but not all\u2014of the bills at that time. As discussed, they would request records and bills from all providers to ensure both sides have copies of all records and invoices. She requested that Muhammad provide his speech pathologist\u2019s name and address as soon as possible so they could obtain those records and bills, noting that this information should be available to him on Norton MyChart. She congratulated him on applying for medical health insurance and cautioned that treatment before the coverage date can be denied, but that this situation would be reviewed and discussed in more detail during the claim negotiation phase. She invited Muhammad to contact them with any questions. The message included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address\u2014712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222\u2014and direct lines: D (502) 357-9971, O (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to use the new email address.

He also mentioned that he would be released from chiropractic care very soon but continued to experience head pain and memory loss related to the first accident, emphasizing the importance of following his doctors\u2019 orders for his traumatic brain injury (TBI) treatment.

In a message dated February 14, 2023 at 13:57:56 -0500, attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm responded to Muhammad Alif and to Sarena Tuttle regarding whether a lawsuit should be filed. Whaley explained that he had spoken with the adjuster, who was not disclosing policy limits because, in the adjuster\u2019s words, \u201cthere is not a concern that this claim will exceed the limits.\u201d The adjuster stated it is a commercial policy with sufficient limits, and Whaley assumed the insurer had at least $500,000, and likely $1,000,000. He offered to file a lawsuit if the client wished, but cautioned that lawsuits are not fast and, if pursued, are usually certain; they are not typically filed unless there is some impasse. Whaley noted there can be merit in filing if one of two disputes\u2014liability or value enough to trigger litigation costs\u2014appears inevitable. However, he did not consider the case to be at an impasse, stating that if a suit were filed, defense counsel would almost certainly engage and proceed with discovery, depositions, and related steps.

      "natural_language": "Case Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 involves client Muhammad Alif. In March 2023, the matter included a forwarded email thread titled \u201cFwd: Muhammad Alif Brain Testing Approval.\u201d On March 14, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, forwarded this item to Aaron Whaley with the note \u201cAnother Request for Approval of Brain Mapping\u2026,\u201d and she included her firm contact details and a note to use her new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe forwarded thread contains a message from Axon Medical Centers Admin dated March 9, 2023, at 3:39 PM, with the subject \u201cMuhammad Alif Brain Testing Approval.\u201d The email is addressed to Muhammad Alif and to Dr. Allen Starkey (drallen@amctbi.com). It states that Axon Medical Centers are requesting approval for traumatic brain injury (TBI) testing for Muhammad Alif, who is a patient of Dr. William Hwang, MD, a physician who is double board-certified in neurology and psychiatry and whose specialty includes physical medicine, rehabilitation, and sleep disorders. Dr. Hwang recommends two procedures prior to treatment: Brain Mapping and MRI/DTI. These tests are intended to better identify traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe TBI testing package, or battery, includes Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology for $8,000 and DTI/MRI for $8,000. The message invites the recipient to learn more about multifactorial testing via the link http://meet.ceostx.com and provides Dr. Matt DeGaetano\u2019s contact at drmatt@ceostx.com for direct discussion if scheduling is needed. The Indications section explains that Brain Mapping and Electrophysiology provide the most sophisticated, state-of-the-art, real-time imaging and brain training available, allowing visualization of live activity in the limbic system, anterior cingulate, fusiform gyrus, Brodmann areas, and more by recording 19 channels of brain activity simultaneously. It notes that brain dysfunction can have a variety of causes, including encephalopathy, memory loss, lack of concentration, brain fog, irritability, forgetfulness, and cognitive decline. For the DTI/MRI, the email describes diffusion tensor imaging as a technique that estimates the axonal (white matter) organization of the brain, with fiber tractography as a 3D reconstruction method to assess neural tracts using DTI data; it is a non-invasive imaging tool used to investigate white matter damaged during traumatic brain injury, even in the absence of neurological symptoms.\n\nThe message asks the recipient to reply with acceptance or denial and to attach a Letter of Protection (LOP) if testing is approved. The administration contact is Axon Medical Centers, which operates in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, El Paso, and Austin, with a general phone number of 855-296-6824.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif. The records reflect a Prescription Approval Request Form for Muhammad Alif and show a sequence of email exchanges between The Whaley Law Firm and ASP Cares\u2019 LOP Department regarding how to handle a high-cost prescription for this patient.\n\nThe thread begins with a July 31, 2023 email from the LOP Department at ASP Cares. They state that they have just received a high-cost prescription for the patient mentioned above and that approval is required before dispensing. They also note that due to the high cost, they cannot accept any reductions for this medication and ask the recipient to review the attached materials. The message includes the LOP contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer, and it urges that all payments be sent to ASP Cares\u2019 corporate office at 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234.\n\nOn August 1, 2023, at approximately 1:07 PM, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note the address of the email) responded. She wrote, \u201cThank you for reaching out. Please bill Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance for this medication.\u201d Her message also carried her standard signature block, which includes her contact information and the note to please use the new email address.\n\nLater on August 1, 2023, at approximately 4:10 PM (the time shown as 4:10? PM in the record), the LOP Department replied. They stated that no medication had yet been filled for the patient and that they were still waiting on the LOP (the LOP). The reply also appeared with the usual confidentiality notice and the ASP Cares contact details (13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; P: 214-919-2534; Fax: 972-330-2783; D: 214-903-3373; bjuarez@aspcares.com; lop@aspcares.com).\n\nOn August 2, 2023, at 09:56 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote again: \u201cGood morning, We have advised that you should bill the patients health insurance for these medications.\u201d She signed her message with her Whaley Law Firm details and reiterated the new email address.\n\nIn summary, the case involves a high-cost prescription for Muhammad Alif that required prior approval before dispensing. There was an explicit push to bill the patient\u2019s private health insurance for the medication, a clarification that no medications had yet been filled pending approval, and ongoing communications between The Whaley Law Firm and the LOP Department, with the corporate ASP Cares payment instructions and confidentiality language included in the signatures of the respective emails.",

      "natural_language": "In the Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 case, the client is Muhammad Alif. A sequence of prescription-approval emails took place between the LOP Department and The Whaley Law Firm from July 31 to August 2, 2023 regarding a high-cost medication for Mr. Alif. The initial message, dated July 31, 2023, from the LOP Department (ASP Cares) informed The Whaley Law Firm that they had just received a high-cost prescription for the patient and would need approval before dispensing; the department also stated that, due to the high cost, they could not accept any reductions for this medication and requested that the recipient review the attached materials. The LOP Department\u2019s message included the standard confidentiality notice and the sender\u2019s contact details: Brenda Juarez, LOP Dept. Manager, ASP Cares, 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; phone 214-919-2534, fax 972-330-2783, direct line 214-903-3373; email bjuarez@aspcares.com, lop@aspcares.com. The note also instructed that all payments be sent to the Corporate Office at ASP Cares, 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234.\n\nOn August 1, 2023 at 1:07 PM, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) replied. She advised that Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance should be billed for this medication. Her signature included alternative contact information: D 502-357-9971, O 502-583-4022 ext 104, E Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note that this was a new email address.\n\nLater on August 1, 2023 at 4:10 PM, the LOP Department responded that they had not filled any medication for the patient yet and were still waiting on the LOP. This message, like the others, contained the standard confidentiality notice and the same contact details for Brenda Juarez and the department, reiterating the corporate-office payments instruction.\n\nOn August 2, 2023 at 8:56 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied again, reiterating that they had advised billing Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance for this medication. Her message included her standard signature block with her role at The Whaley Law Firm and contact information.\n\nThat same day, August 2, 2023 at 10:18 AM, the LOP Department, via Brenda Juarez, responded to close the thread with an update: the medication would be transferred out to the patient\u2019s local pharmacy. The message began with, \u201cWe will have the medication transferred out to their local pharmacy. Thank you! Thank you!\u201d and was signed by Brenda Juarez, LOP Dept. Manager. The email again included the confidentiality notice and the ASP Cares address and payment instructions to send all payments to the Corporate Office.\n\nAcross the thread, there were repeated confidentiality statements indicating that the contents of each email and its attachments were intended solely for the addressee(s) and may be confidential or privileged between attorneys or their clients, with instructions to delete the message if received in error.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif. The notes describe a Prescription Approval Request Form for Muhammad Alif. On August 4, 2023, at 13:08:29 Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager with The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email regarding the Re: Prescription Approval Request Form for Muhammad Alif and attached the requested LOP Rx Approval Form. Her contact details are listed as The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (new email address noted). The message was addressed to the LOP Department at ASP Cares, and included a confidentiality note typical of such correspondence.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on August 2, 2023, at approximately 11:18 AM (the record shows as 11:18?AM), the LOP Department replied: \u201cWe will have the medication transferred out to their local pharmacy. Thank you!\u201d The signature block for Brenda Juarez, LOP Department Manager, follows, including the office address at 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; telephone 214-919-2534; fax 972-330-2783; direct line 214-903-3373; email bjuarez@aspcares.com and lop@aspcares.com. The message also asks that all payments be sent to the ASP Cares corporate office at the same Diplomat Dr. address.\n\nThe same day, August 2, 2023, Sarena Tuttle included a confidentiality notice and wrote: \u201cGood morning, We have advised that you should bill the patient\u2019s health insurance for these medications.\u201d Her signature again lists her role at The Whaley Law Firm and provides the same contact details as above, including the new email address.\n\nEarlier still, on August 1, 2023, at 1:07 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote: \u201cThank you for reaching out. Please bill Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance for this medication.\u201d Her message carried the same contact details and the note about the new email address.\n\nOn August 1, 2023, at 4:10 PM, the LOP Department responded: \u201cWe have not filled any medication for the patient yet. We are still waiting on the LOP.\u201d This message also included Brenda Juarez\u2019s signature and the same ASP Cares contact details, as well as the confidentiality notice.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, at 12:29 PM, the LOP Department had written: \u201cHello, We just received a high-cost prescription for the patient mentioned above to which we will need approval before dispensing. Also, due to the high cost, we cannot accept any reductions for this medication. Please see attached.\u201d This message was signed by the LOP Department and included the corporate ASP Cares address and confidentiality notice.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the thread consistently shows the case file for Muhammad Alif, the handling of a high-cost prescription requiring prior approval, and the ongoing directive to bill the patient\u2019s private health insurance rather than accepting reductions. The communications repeatedly feature the parties involved: Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm and Brenda Juarez, LOP Department Manager at ASP Cares, along with the corporate payments instruction and the standard confidentiality notices attached to email correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This matter concerns a high-cost prescription for Mr. Alif that required prior approval (LOP approval) before dispensing. The communications span late July to early August 2023 and involve the LOP Department at ASP Cares and The Whaley Law Firm on behalf of the patient.\n\nOn July 31, 2023, the LOP Department sent a message stating that they had just received a high-cost prescription for the patient mentioned above and would need approval before dispensing. They added that due to the high cost, they could not accept any reductions for this medication, and they requested the recipient to review the attached materials. The message was signed by Brenda Juarez, LOP Dept. Manager, and included the LOP department\u2019s contact details (13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; P: 214-919-2534; Fax: 972-330-2783; D: 214-903-3373; bjuarez@aspcares.com; lop@aspcares.com) along with a confidentiality notice stating that the contents are intended for the addressee and may be privileged; it also instructed that all payments be sent to the ASP Cares corporate office at the same Diplomat Drive address.\n\nThe following day, August 1, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied at 1:07 PM, thanking the sender and advising that Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance should be billed for this medication. Sarena\u2019s signature identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with addresses and contact details including 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address as the new email). Earlier that same day, the LOP Department responded at 4:10 PM, noting that they had not filled any medication for the patient yet and were still waiting on the LOP.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, at 8:56 AM, Sarena again advised that the patient\u2019s health insurance should be billed for these medications. Later that day, at 11:18 AM, the LOP Department wrote that they would have the medication transferred to the patient\u2019s local pharmacy and thanked the recipient. Brenda Juarez\u2019s signature block was included again, with the same contact information and payment instructions, followed by the confidentiality statement.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, at 12:08 PM, Sarena sent another message noting that the Requested LOP Rx Approval Form was attached, and she again provided her contact information and updated email address. Then, at 12:29 PM on the same day, Brenda Juarez replied with a brief \u201cThank you!\u201d Her reply included the same signature block and the corporate office address for payments, reiterating that all payments should be sent to ASP Cares at 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234. The exchanges also contained the standard Statement of Confidentiality applicable to the emails, indicating that the contents were intended for the addressee(s) and may be privileged; recipients who were not the intended addressee were advised not to read or disclose the transmission and to delete it if received in error.\n\nThroughout the thread, the messages referenced the intended process for approving and processing a high-cost prescription for Muhammad Alif, including billing to private health insurance or the patient\u2019s health insurance, transferring the medication to a local pharmacy, awaiting the LOP approval, and sending payments to the corporate ASP Cares office. The correspondence also included standard contact details for both the LOP Department at ASP Cares and The Whaley Law Firm, as well as confidentiality notices embedded in each message.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nIn August 2023, a sequence of email communications concerned a high-cost prescription for Muhammad Alif, related to his motor vehicle accident (MVA) case. The correspondence involved Brenda Juarez, LOP Department Manager at ASP Cares, and Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm. The discussion centered on obtaining approval to dispense the medication and on billing arrangements.\n\nThe thread began on July 31, 2023, when the LOP Department noted that the patient\u2019s prescription was high-cost and would require approval before dispensing. The note also stated that due to the high cost, they could not accept an unspecified option that was left incomplete in the original message. On August 1, 2023 at 1:07 PM, Sarena advised that Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance should be billed for the medication. Later that same day, at 4:10 PM, the LOP Department replied that they had not yet filled any medication for the patient and were still waiting on the LOP.\n\nThe following day, August 2, 2023, at 8:56 AM, Sarena reiterated the recommendation to bill the patient\u2019s private health insurance for the medications. Then at 11:18 AM, the LOP Department stated that they would have the medication transferred out to the patient\u2019s local pharmacy. By August 4, 2023, the communications included a note from Sarena indicating that the requested LOP Rx Approval Form had been attached.\n\nOn August 4, 2023 at 12:08 PM, Sarena again confirmed the attached form was sent, and Brenda Juarez subsequently sent an additional message at 12:29 PM to acknowledge and sign off, with the standard confidentiality notice included in the email. Finally, at 3:12 PM (August 4, 2023, 15:12:56 -0500), Brenda clarified the cost details: the cost of the medication is $3,000.00 with no reduction, and she invited any questions at her phone number (214-903-3373). She noted that an updated approval form was attached and provided her contact information and the ASP Cares corporate office address for payments: ASP Cares, 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234. The communications repeatedly included the standard confidentiality statements typical of these emails, indicating that the contents were intended solely for the addressee(s) and were confidential and privileged if applicable.\n\nIn summary, the main facts are: the patient Muhammad Alif\u2019s prescription was identified as high-cost and requiring prior approval; the recommended billing approach was to bill Mr. Alif\u2019s private health insurance; the medication was to be transferred to the patient\u2019s local pharmacy; the established payments were to be sent to ASP Cares\u2019 corporate office; and the updated LOP Rx Approval Form was attached in the communications. The documented cost of the medication was $3,000.00 with no reductions, and Brenda Juarez provided the final confirmation and contact details related to the approval and payment process.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nIn August 2023, the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s file concerning Muhammad Alif, whose motor vehicle accident case is dated 11-08-2022, included a running email thread about a prescription approval for his medication. On August 7, 2023, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: this is a new email address), forwarded to Aaron Whaley an email titled \u201cPrescription Approval Request Form - Muhammad Alif.\u201d In that forwarded message, she wrote: \u201cApparently Mo's Medication is actually $3000.00 not $1000.00 - Need new approval form.\u201d This included the context that the medication cost had changed and a new approval form was required.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on August 4, 2023, Brenda Juarez, LOP Dept. Manager at ASP Cares (address: 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; P: 214-919-2534; D: 214-903-3373; Fax: 972-330-2783; bjuarez@aspcares.com; lop@aspcares.com; corporate payments to: ASP Cares, 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234), responded to the matter. In a message dated August 4, 2023 at 4:13 PM, she stated that there had been confusion on their part and that the medication cost is $3,000.00 with no reduction. She invited any questions and provided her contact number (214-903-3373) and noted the updated approval form attached. She also included the ASP Cares office information and the confidentiality statement common to their emails. Earlier that same day, at 12:08 PM, Sarena Tuttle had written to Brenda: \u201cPlease find attached the Requested LOP Rx Approval Form.\u201d Brenda later replied with a brief \u201cThank you!\u201d at 12:29 PM.\n\nThe email chain began with Sarena Tuttle\u2019s guidance on billing and prescription handling. On August 1, 2023 at 1:07 PM, Sarena wrote: \u201cThank you for reaching out. Please bill Mr. Alif's private health insurance for this medication.\u201d Later that afternoon, at 4:10 PM, the LOP Department responded: \u201cWe have not filled any medication for the patient yet. We are still waiting on the LOP.\u201d The following day, August 2, 2023 at 8:56 AM, Sarena stated: \u201cGood morning, We have advised that you should bill the patients health insurance for these medications.\u201d At 11:18 AM that day, the LOP Department replied: \u201cWe will have the medication transferred out to their local pharmacy.\u201d\n\nThus, the thread shows a sequence of steps: initial instruction to bill private health insurance, acknowledgment that no medication had been filled yet while awaiting the LOP, the plan to transfer the medication to the local pharmacy, and finally the September/early August exchange preparing for an updated LOP Rx Approval Form reflecting the $3,000 cost.\n\nAmid these exchanges, the correspondence consistently included standard confidentiality notices. The final note in the chain, dated August 7, 2023, is a forward of Sarena\u2019s earlier message to Aaron Whaley with the line about the medication costing $3,000 and the need for a new approval form. The thread thus documents ongoing coordination between The Whaley Law Firm and ASP Cares regarding Muhammad Alif\u2019s LOP medication, including cost updates, billing instructions to private health insurance, and the processing of the LOP Rx Approval Form.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This note chronicles a sequence of email communications in August 2023 between The Whaley Law Firm and ASP Cares regarding a prescription approval for Muhammad Alif, related to an MVA case dated November 8, 2022.\n\nThe exchange began on August 1, 2023, when Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager) responded to Brenda Juarez of ASP Cares, subject: Re: Prescription Approval Request Form - Muhammad Alif. In her message, sent at 1:07 PM, Sarena wrote, \u201cThank you for reaching out. Ple\u201d and noted her contact details, including her new Whaley Law Firm email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky office information.\n\nEarlier that same day, the LOP Department at ASP Cares replied that no medication had yet been filled for the patient and that they were waiting on the LOP, adding contact details and reiterating that the updated approval form would be attached.\n\nOn August 2, 2023, at 8:56 AM, Sarena Tuttle advised that the patient\u2019s health insurance should be billed for these medications. Later that morning, at 11:18 AM, the LOP Department indicated that they would have the medication transferred out to the patient\u2019s local pharmacy.\n\nOn August 4, 2023, at 12:08 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent the Requested LOP Rx Approval Form as an attachment. Brenda Juarez replied at 12:29 PM with a brief \u201cThank you!\u201d and included her standard department signature block and confidentiality notice, which appeared in each message.\n\nThat same day, later in the afternoon at 4:13 PM, Brenda Juarez wrote that there had been some confusion on their part, and stated that the cost of the medication was $3,000.00 with no reduction. She invited any questions and provided her contact number (214-903-3373), noting that the updated approval form would be attached.\n\nOn August 7, 2023, at 12:45 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote back to Brenda Juarez: \u201cGood morning Brenda, Thank you for the updated information. Please find attached the updated prescription approval form.\u201d Her signature again included the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and her contact details, and she reminded recipients to note her new email address.\n\nThroughout this chain, the following organizational details appeared in the messages:\n- The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address).\n- ASP Cares (LOP Department): 13988 Diplomat Dr. Suite 100, Farmers Branch, TX 75234; P: 214-919-2534; Fax: 972-330-2783; D: 214-903-3373; bjuarez@aspcares.com; lop@aspcares.com; and a directive to send all payments to the ASP Cares Corporate Office at the same address.\n- Each email in the thread contained a standard STATEMENT OF CONFIDENTIALITY, indicating that the contents and attachments were intended for the addressee(s) and may be confidential or privileged, with instructions to delete or respond if received in error.\n\nIn brief, the thread documents: the initiation of prescription-related communication for Muhammad Alif, regulatory steps including LOP coordination and medication transfer to a local pharmacy, insurance billing guidance, the preparation and attachment of the LOP Rx Approval Form, collaboration on cost clarification ($3,000 with no reduction), and the final update confirming an updated prescription approval form.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nThe case file for Muhammad Alif\u2019s motor vehicle accident (MVA) matter dated 11-08-2022 has been the subject of a long-running email thread between The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health. In a message dated January 23, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, advised April Mullins that the claim is still in litigation. She noted that, once the firm reaches a point for settlement discussions, they will contact Aptiva Health to discuss any outstanding balances. Sarena also included that this is her new email address and provided her contact information and office details.\n\nEarlier, on January 22, 2024, April Mullins\u2014A/R Specialist / Lien Negotiator and Attorney Liaison for Aptiva Health\u2014sent a follow-up email asking for the status of Muhammad Alif\u2019s case. Her message was directed to Aaron Whaley and circulated with Sarena Tuttle. Mullins\u2019 signature block listed her office and cell numbers, email address (amullins@aptivahealth.com), and Aptiva Health\u2019s website (aptivahealth.com), with the office at 3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218. The message also carried Aptiva Health\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe thread\u2019s chronology shows earlier communications from Aaron Whaley. On October 20, 2023, Aaron informed April that the matter was pending and that a suit had been filed. This was followed by a June 27, 2023 email from April Mullins, in which she stated that Farmers had advised their office that the beneficiary\u2019s benefits were reserved, and that Muhammad Alif currently had a balance of $1,475 with the office. She also indicated that she had included a copy of his itemization for review. Aaron Whaley responded on June 28, 2023, noting that the matter was still in progress.\n\nThe email chain reflects the recipients and correspondence trail among The Whaley Law Firm, Aptiva Health, and the involved parties, with the case subject line repeatedly referencing Muhammad Alif MVA 11/8/22. The signatures show multiple contact points: Sarena Tuttle\u2019s affiliation with The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222 (D) 502-357-9971, O 502-583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting a new email address; and Aptiva Health\u2019s details including office and cell numbers, and the Louisville address of 3615 Newburg Road (and 12300 Plantside Dr in earlier correspondence). The threads also include standard confidentiality notices on the sent emails, and a trailing signature line referencing AptivaHealth\u2019s Twitter link.",

In the email, Deborah stated that they could do May 23 and proposed a 10:00 a.m. start time for Mr. Alif\u2019s deposition, with Ms. Wickliffe\u2019s deposition to follow after work. She asked whether the depositions should be noticed for Whaley\u2019s office or, alternatively, they could be held at the Vine Center\u2019s Louisville office. Deborah identified herself as the Legal Assistant to George B. Hocker, Ashley K. Brown, Maxwell D. Smith, William J. Barker II, Jared M. Hudson, and Jeanette L.

A standard confidentiality disclaimer accompanied the message.\n\nThe following day, February 21, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied.

She added that they could do May 21 through May 23 for deposition dates.\n\nEarlier, on February 20, 2024, Deborah Jackson had written back to Sarena, apologizing for the delay in providing deposition dates for Ms. Wickliffe. Deborah explained that they would like to schedule the Plaintiff\u2019s deposition as well and noted that, due to multiple upcoming trials, they were scheduling into late April. She enumerated available deposition dates: April 29, April 30, May 1, May 2, May 6 through May 9, May 20 through May 24, and May 27 through May 30.

      "natural_language": "In the Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al. case (Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022), the client is Muhammad Alif. The correspondence centers on scheduling depositions and possible trial dates, with coordination between The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville and Vine Center in Lexington.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Deborah Jackson, a legal assistant at Vine Center (333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507; P: 859.422.6000; F: 859.422.6001; www.whtlaw.com), wrote to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) to propose dates for the deposition of Ms. Wickliffe and to begin scheduling Plaintiff\u2019s deposition as well. Deborah listed the available dates as 4/29, 4/30, 5/1, 5/2, 5/6\u20135/9, 5/20\u20135/24, and 5/27\u20135/30, noting that they were scheduling into late April due to multiple upcoming trials.\n\nThe next day, February 21, 2024, Sarena replied that there were also tentative trial dates to consider: a trial on 4/29, which is Derby Week, and a second tentative trial the week of 5/6, with the possibility of trial dates on May 21\u201323. This message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, reiterating her contact details and noting the email address as a new address (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\n\nOn February 22, 2024, Deborah responded again from Vine Center, stating that they could do May 23 and proposing a 10:00 a.m. start time for Mr. Alif\u2019s deposition, with Ms. Wickliffe\u2019s deposition to follow after work. She asked whether the notices should be sent to The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office or, alternatively, they could be held at Vine Center\u2019s Louisville office. Deborah\u2019s message included her firm\u2019s standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, February 22, 2024, Sarena replied: \u201cGood afternoon Deborah, That sounds perfect. Yes, we would prefer to use your Louisville Office as all other parties are located in Louisville. I will get a notice for Mrs. Wickcliffe to you as soon as possible.\u201d In this note, Sarena confirmed the preference for using the Louisville office and indicated she would prepare and send the notice for Wickliffe/Wickcliffe.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, both sides included their standard email signatures and confidentiality notices. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s communications repeatedly referenced their Louisville office as the preferred location for notices, given that all other parties were located in Louisville, and Sarena indicated she would issue the notice for Ms. Wickliffe (also spelled Wickcliffe in one instance) promptly. The exchanges also highlighted the Derby Week context for the proposed 4/29 date and outlined multiple May dates and the specific 10:00 a.m. start for a May 23 deposition, with Wickliffe/Wickliffe\u2019s deposition to follow after Mr. Alif\u2019s.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al., Muhammad Alif is the client. In February 2024, the matter was being coordinated between The Whaley Law Firm and WHT Law to schedule depositions for Mr. Alif and for Ms. Wickliffe, with correspondence involving Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and Deborah Jackson, a legal assistant at Vine Center\u2019s WHT Law office.\n\nOn February 20, 2024, Deborah Jackson replied to Sarena Tuttle, apologizing for the delay and indicating that they would like to schedule the plaintiff\u2019s deposition as well, noting that there were multiple upcoming trials and that they were scheduling into late April. Deborah provided available dates: April 29, April 30, May 1, May 2, May 6 through May 9, May 20 through May 24, and May 27 through May 30. She asked that Sarena let them know which dates would work for Mr. Alif and for Ms. Wickliffe so they could confirm with Ms. Wickliffe.\n\nThe next day, February 21, 2024, Sarena responded. She noted that there were tentative trials on April 29 (Derby Week) and a second tentative trial in the week of May 6, adding that they could do May 21\u201323.\n\nEarly on February 22, 2024, Deborah replied again, proposing that deposition for the plaintiff could be scheduled on May 23, with a start time of 10:00 a.m. for Mr. Alif, followed by Ms. Wickliffe\u2019s deposition later in the day. Deborah asked whether these depositions should be noticed for The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville office or if they should be held at WHT Law\u2019s Louisville office.\n\nLater on February 22, 2024, at 1:39 p.m., Sarena wrote back, agreeing with the arrangement. She stated that they would prefer to use the Louisville office since all other parties were located there, and she would send a notice for Mrs. Wickliffe as soon as possible.\n\nShortly after, at 1:55 p.m. (13:55:29 -0500) on the same day, Sarena sent another message, this time attaching the Notice to Take Deposition of Mrs. Wickcliffe, which she indicated would be filed momentarily. She added that if Deborah needed anything else, she should contact them directly to discuss further details. The message included Sarena\u2019s full contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting the email as the new address. The email also carried the standard confidentiality notice and contact guidelines, including the reminder that the information is privileged and confidential and that, if not the intended recipient, the recipient should delete the message and notify the sender. The CC line listed agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, bryce@whaleylawfirm.com, Max Smith (Max.Smith@whtlaw.com), and Kaylee Collins (kaylee.collins@whtlaw.com).\n\nThroughout the exchange, the parties discussed coordinating the deposition schedule around upcoming trials, with the plan to conduct Mr. Alif\u2019s deposition on May 23, 2024, at 10:00 a.m., and to have Ms. Wickliffe\u2019s deposition follow later that day, and to notice the deposition for the Louisville office as requested. The communications also included standard protective language regarding email confidentiality and external email cautions.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nIn the Muhammed Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al. matter, communications in late February 2024 revolved around scheduling and obtaining deposition notices for both the plaintiff, Muhammad Alif, and the defendant-witness, Mrs. Wickliffe. The exchange began with Deborah Jackson, a legal assistant with Vine Center/WHT Law in Lexington, Kentucky, sending an email on February 22, 2024 at 19:14:51 UTC to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. Deborah stated that she would be filing, momentarily, the Notice of Deposition for Mr. Alif and thanked Sarena for her help in getting the depositions scheduled. Deborah\u2019s email also included the firm\u2019s confidentially notice and signature block, which listed Vine Center\u2019s address at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, along with telephone and fax numbers and the firm\u2019s website. The message noted that Deborah was the legal assistant to George B. Hocker, Ashley K. Brown, Maxwell D. Smith, William J. Barker, II, Jared M. Hudson, and Jeanette L. Jayne, and it contained an attached image reference.\n\nEarlier on February 22, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied at 1:55 PM, confirming that The Whaley Law Firm attached and would file the Notice to take the Deposition of Mrs. Wickliffe. She also encouraged Deborah to reach out if any further discussion was needed and provided her contact details, including her new email address. The same day, at 1:39 PM, Sarena followed up with a note that they preferred to use Deborah\u2019s Louisville office since all other parties were located there, and she would obtain a deposition notice for Mrs. Wickliffe to be sent to Deborah as soon as possible.\n\nEarlier still, Deborah had proposed a deposition date of May 23, 2024, with a 10:00 a.m. start time for Mr. Alif and Mrs. Wickliffe to follow after work, and she asked whether the depositions should be noticed for The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office or held at Vine Center\u2019s Louisville office. This exchange occurred in an email from Deborah on February 22, 2024 at 8:31 AM. Deborah\u2019s email also asked for confirmation about the preferred deposition venue and included the firm\u2019s confidentially notice.\n\nThe scheduling conversation began a few days earlier. On February 21, 2024 at 10:04 AM, Sarena had written to Deborah (with copies to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, bryce@whaleylawfirm.com, Max Smith, and Kaylee Collins) about tentative trial dates: April 29 (Derby Week), a second tentative trial the week of May 6, and the possibility of May 21\u201323. Sarena\u2019s message conveyed the broader context of trials that could affect deposition scheduling and provided her contact information.\n\nFinally, on February 20, 2024 at 2:36 PM, Deborah responded to Sarena, apologizing for the delay in confirming dates for Mrs. Wickliffe\u2019s deposition. She stated that they would also like to schedule the Plaintiff\u2019s deposition and noted that due to multiple upcoming trials they were scheduling into late April. Deborah listed available dates: April 29, April 30, May 1, May 2, May 6\u2013May 9, May 20\u2013May 24, and May 27\u2013May 30, and she asked Sarena to indicate which dates would work for The Whaley Law Firm, Mr. Alif, and Mrs. Wickliffe so they could proceed with confirmation.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discussed using the Louisville office for notice and scheduling, coordinated notices for both depositions (Mr. Alif and Mrs. Wickliffe), and prepared the corresponding deposition notices to be filed. The communications included standard confidentiality notices and references to the involved offices and attorneys, with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Louisville address listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and Deborah\u2019s firm communications referencing the Vine Center in Lexington, KY.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif, and the file concerns a motor vehicle accident that occurred on November 8, 2022. The following narrative summarizes the email exchanges between Aptiva Health and The Whaley Law Firm regarding the case, its litigation status, and any outstanding balances, from mid-2023 through January 2024.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, April Mullins, A/R Specialist / Lien Negotiator and Attorney Liaison at Aptiva Health, wrote to Aaron Whaley (and copied Sarena Tuttle) noting that Farmers advised their office that the client\u2019s benefits are reserved and that Muhammad Alif currently has a balance of $1,475 with Aptiva Health. She also mentioned that a copy of his itemization had been included for review. In her signature she identified her role, provided contact information (Office: 502-909-0772; Cell: 502-428-1346; amullins@aptivahealth.com; aptivahealth.com), and listed the office address as 3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218. A confidentiality disclaimer was attached to the email.\n\nThe following day, June 28, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied, stating simply, \u201cStill in progress,\u201d and he cc\u2019d Sarena Tuttle. The email signature for Aaron and the chain shown his affiliation with The Whaley Law Firm, which is located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and included contact numbers.\n\nOn October 20, 2023, two related messages were exchanged. At 3:01 PM, April Mullins sent: \u201cGood Evening I just wanted to follow up on the status of his case. Thank you,\u201d reiterating her role and contact details (Office 502-909-0772; Cell 502-428-1346; amullins@aptivahealth.com; aptivahealth.com; 3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218). A confidentiality disclaimer was again included.\n\nLater that same afternoon, at 3:27 PM, Aaron Whaley responded: \u201cpending. Filed suit.\u201d He had been copied on the prior message and again referenced in the thread along with Sarena Tuttle.\n\nMoving forward, on January 23, 2024, the thread shows further activity. On January 22, 2024 at 9:29 PM (as shown in the record), April Mullins sent another follow-up message to Aaron, again stating, \u201cGood Evening Aaron I just wanted to follow up on the status of his case,\u201d and including her standard signature block and confidentiality notice.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, at 9:43 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct: 502-357-9971; Office: 502-583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: this is a new email address), replied to April. Her message stated: \u201cGood morning April, This claim is still in litigation. Once we get to a point of settlement discussions, our office will reach out to discuss any outstanding balances.\u201d The message carried a confidentiality disclaimer and signature blocks for both Sarena and Aaron Whaley.\n\nThroughout the thread, the emails include standard confidentiality notices indicating that the messages and any attachments are intended only for the named recipients and may contain legally privileged or confidential information.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nRe: Muhammad Alif MVA 11/8/22. Over the period reflected in the email chain, the matter remained active and primarily litigated, with routine status updates exchanged between The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, April Mullins, acting as A/R Specialist / Lien Negotiator and Attorney Liaison for Aptiva Health, wrote to provide an update on the status of Muhammad Alif\u2019s case. She noted that Farmers had advised that Mr. Alif\u2019s benefits were reserved and that he currently carried a balance of $1,475 with Aptiva Health. She also stated that a copy of his itemization had been included for review. The signature block shows Mullins\u2019 title and contact information: Office 502-909-0772; Cell 502-428-1346; amullins@aptivahealth.com; aptivahealth.com; and the Louisville address listed as 3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218.\n\nThe following day, June 28, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied, indicating simply that the matter was \u201cStill in progress.\u201d\n\nOn October 20, 2023, Aaron Whaley sent a brief update stating the case was \u201cpending\u201d and that a suit had been filed. Later that same day, October 20, 2023, at 3:01 PM, April Mullins sent a follow-up message to Aaron Whaley addressing the status of the case. Her signature block lists her titles again and provides Aptiva Health\u2019s contact details: Office 502-909-0772; Cell 502-428-1346; amullins@aptivahealth.com; aptivahealth.com; with the Louisville addresses included as 3615 Newburg Road, Louisville, KY 40218 (in this message) and the later sign-off showing 12300 Plantside Dr, Louisville, KY 40299 (in others).\n\nJumping forward to January 2024, Mullins again followed up with April 12 and then January 22\u201323. On January 22, 2024 at 9:29 PM, Mullins wrote to Aaron Whaley asking for an update on the case's status. Her signature once again listed her role as A/R Specialist / Lien Negotiator and Attorney Liaison, with her contact details: Office 502-909-0772; Cell 502-428-1346; amullins@aptivahealth.com; aptivahealth.com; and the address 12300 Plantside Dr, Louisville, KY 40299 (the signature also contains the earlier address variants). \n\nOn January 23, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, the Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Mullins. She stated that the claim was still in litigation and that once the office reached the point of settlement discussions, they would reach out to discuss any outstanding balances. Tuttle\u2019s signature block includes her title, affiliation, and contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; and a note to use the new email address.\n\nFollowing these January exchanges, Mullins sent another follow-up on April 12, 2024 at 4:57 PM, asking for an update on the case\u2019s status. Her email, like the others, carried Aptiva Health\u2019s confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the message and any attachments were intended only for the addressees and may contain legally privileged or confidential information.\n\nFinally, on April 15, 2024, at 10:23:04 AM (Eastern Time), Sarena M. Tuttle responded that the claim remained in litigation and that depositions were scheduled for May 23, 2024. She added that it was unlikely there would be significant movement before June 23, 3024, and she promised to reach out with an update if anything new occurred prior to that date. Tuttle\u2019s contact details were included in her signature, consistent with prior messages.\n\nIn summary, from mid-2023 through April 2024, Muhammad Alif\u2019s motor vehicle accident claim remained in litigation. A deposition was scheduled for May 23, 2024, and, at least as of April 15, 2024, no significant movement was expected before June 23, 3024. The parties involved in the communications included Sarena M. Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), April Mullins (Aptiva Health), and Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), with multiple email exchanges regarding case status, outstanding balances, and settlement discussions.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nOn Monday, April 15, 2024, the Whaley Law Firm exchanged a series of emails about a Verification Page in Muhammad Alif\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation matter. The thread began with Bryce Koon asking, in a message originally sent by him and dated around 9:18 AM, whether the client\u2019s e-signature had been obtained for the verification page. A follow-up note at about 9:24 AM from Bryce added that he would appreciate having the completed document for a motion later that day, since the motion hearing was at 11:45 AM. The message was copycc\u2019d to MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nEarlier in the thread, at approximately 9:23 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied that Muhammad Alif had viewed the verification page but that she did not see where it had been completed. In a subsequent message, around 9:34 AM, Sarena wrote that she had just spoken with him and that he would get the page executed. Later, at about 11:18 AM, Sarena sent the page with the note \u201cHere you go.\u201d The topmost email in the chain, sent from Sarena at 11:22:11 AM -0400, included the line \u201cSorry, the stamp did not save.\u201d and contained Sarena\u2019s signature and contact details, noting the new email address. The chain\u2019s signatures indicate Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone numbers and email address listed, and a reminder to use her new email address. The thread also shows that the Verification Page was CC\u2019d to MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.",

Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al., Jefferson Circuit Court case number 23-CI-005509.\n\nIn April 2024, a series of email exchanges transpired between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and the law firm Vine Center regarding discovery documents and a signed medical authorization. On April 15, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Max Smith and Kaylee Collins (copied to Sarena Tuttle and Deborah Jackson) with the subject Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al. (Jefferson Circuit 23-CI-005509). The email attached the Discovery Verification page for Mr. Alif and stated that if anything else was needed, the sender should be notified. The message was signed by Bryce Koon and included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information and a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn April 18, 2024, Kaylee Collins, Associate Attorney at Vine Center, replied to Bryce Koon and Max Smith. In her message, she thanked Bryce and explained that in Mr. Alif\u2019s responses to their written discovery requests, specifically Request for Production of Documents (RFPD) No. 8 requesting a signed medical authorization, the response indicated \u201csee attached.\u201d She could not locate a signed medical authorization in the document production and asked that it be resent at their earliest convenience, noting she could be overlooking it.\n\nThe following day, April 19, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Kaylee Collins. She stated that the Executed Medical Authorization should have been returned to Kaylee Collins with the original set of discovery responses and she attached a copy for Kaylee\u2019s records.

She stated that she had reviewed a 189-page production and that it appears to be all employee-related. She also noted that she did not see a company insurance policy/DEC page and asked whether they should simply request it or formally send Supplemental Requests.\n\nAt 10:57 AM on May 10, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied: \u201csimple letter requesting since they said it was included. I assume it is an oversight.\u201d\n\nAt 11:49 AM on May 10, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied: \u201cGot it. Will do.\u201d\n\nSignatures accompanying the messages show the following contact details and roles:\n\n- Sarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This matter is identified as Muhammad Alif v Jacqueline Wickcliffe, Jeff Division 7, 23-CI-005509.\n\nThe note documents a sequence of email communications regarding the case, beginning with a May 10, 2024 exchange in which The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, and Kaylee Collins of Vine Center exchanged information about discovery materials related to the plaintiff\u2019s case.\n\nOn May 10, 2024, at 11:55 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle sent an email to Max Smith, Kaylee Collins, and Deborah Jackson, with Greg Whaley and Bryce Koon CC\u2019d. The subject line was Muhammad Alif v Jacqueline Wickcliffe - Jeff Div 7 23-CI-005509. In the body of the message, Sarena explained that, during a deeper review of the Responses to Plaintiff Alif\u2019s Discovery Request, the Response to RFPD No. 16 claimed that a Declaration Page was attached. However, after reviewing 189 pages, she and her team could not locate any information related to the defendants\u2019 insurance policies and/or declaration pages. She requested that Kaylee Collins forward any and all documents that were missing from the responses up to and including the insurance policies and declaration pages relevant to the subject accident. The message concluded with Sarena\u2019s contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and a note that this is her new email address. The email also carried the standard external email caution noting not to read, distribute, or reproduce if not the intended recipient, and to delete and notify the sender if received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, at about 3:36 PM, Kaylee Collins, Associate Attorney at Vine Center, replied to Sarena with the line: \u201cPlease see attached policy & dec page.\u201d Kaylee\u2019s email signature identified her as an Associate Attorney at Vine Center, located at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with a telephone number P: 859.422.6000 and a fax number F: 859.422.6001. She also included Vine Center\u2019s website, www.whtlaw.com, and a confidentiality notice asserting that the information in the email transmission is privileged and confidential. The notice instructed that if the recipient is not the intended person, they should not read, distribute, or reproduce the transmission or attachments; if received in error, they should delete the email and notify the sender so records can be corrected. The message also reiterated Kaylee\u2019s new email address and included the standard external email caution.\n\nOn May 13, 2024, at 09:47:37 -0400, Sarena M. Tuttle replied to Kaylee Collins with the simple acknowledgment: \u201cReceived, thank you so much Kaylee.\u201d Sarena\u2019s signature block followed, again listing her name, title, and contact information (Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com) and including the note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS\u201d along with the standard external email warning.\n\nIn summary, the observed communications reflect a May 10, 2024 exchange addressing a gap in the discovery responses related to insurance policy information and declaration pages. Sarena requested all missing documents, and Kaylee responded the same day with a notice that the policy and declaration page were attached. Acknowledgment of receipt from Sarena followed on May 13, 2024.",

It was explained that Mrs. Smith and Mr. O'Donnell will likely be asked to remain in the hallway, and he should not be upset if that occurs. Deposition dos and don'ts were discussed: keep answers short and sweet, with yes/no answers only when possible, because the more you speak, the more they can twist.

In the body of Aaron\u2019s message, he simply stated, \u201cI paid it.\u201d\n\nEarlier that same morning, at around 10:53 AM, Aaron had asked, \u201cDo we have the deposition transcripts back yet?\u201d In the reply sent at about 11:01 AM, Sarena Tuttle noted that Bryce had verified the spelling of some party names on the fourth for Mo\u2019s deposition and that she would follow up with the reporter. She also reported that the firm had received an invoice for the defense deposition dated 06/24, in the amount of $373.10, and she asked whether she should pay it online or if Muhammad Alif\u2019s file should be issued a check to Faye.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nIn the matter of a new appointment request for Muhammad Alif, born 04/16/1961, communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Aptiva Health in July 2024. On Friday, July 12, 2024 at 09:31:33 a.m. Eastern Time, Sarena M. Tuttle, listed as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to April Mullins of Aptiva Health. The subject was \u201cRe: New Appointment Request for Muhammad Alif DOB 04/16/1961.\u201d In her message, Sarena stated, \u201cThank you so much April. Let\u2019s do a lien for now and I will review his records and get with Aaron on whether his neck injury is related to the 1st or 2nd MVA.\u201d She signed with her full contact details, noting a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm\u2019s address in Louisville, KY and direct lines.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on Thursday, July 11, 2024, there were two related exchanges. At approximately 3:27 p.m., Sarena sent a message to April with a summary of Mr. Alif\u2019s situation. She explained that Mr. Alif had called requesting assistance to arrange an appointment to examine his cervical spine. He had been involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/08/2022 and a second one on 12/09/2022, and he reported ongoing pain in his cervical area. He described the pain as beginning on the left side of his neck and traveling down beneath his shoulder blade, a pattern that has made it difficult for him to find a comfortable sleep position. Mr. Alif was out of town until Monday and wished to be seen as soon as possible upon his return, requesting that scheduling staff contact them to discuss and arrange an appointment for Mr. Alif on or about Tuesday, July 16, 2024. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, with the same firm contact details as above.\n\nIn response, on the same day, July 11, 2024, at about 10:21 p.m., April Mullins replied to Sarena. April is an A/R Specialist and Lien Negotiator, serving as Attorney Liaison. Her message suggested that they could reach out to Mr. Alif to schedule a follow-up under the second MVA and asked whether American Transit remained on file, or whether Mr. Alif would need to be seen on a lien or through health coverage.\n\nThe following day, July 12, 2024, Sarena replied to April\u2019s thread. She stated, \u201cLet's do a lien for now and I will review his records and get with Aaron on whether his neck injury is related to the 1st or 2nd MVA.\u201d Her signature block appeared again with The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and the updated email address, noting to contact her at Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The correspondence line included the firm\u2019s contact numbers: D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.",

On September 25, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email regarding ChartSwap issues addressed by Radiology Alliance, PC. The message was addressed to Bryce Koon and CC\u2019d to Greg Whaley, with the subject line \u201cFwd: ChartSwap: Issue Addressed by Radiology Alliance, PC.\u201d In the body, Sarena explains she is trying to obtain a certified copy of Radiology Alliance\u2019s billing for the 11/08 MVA. ChartSwap is charging a $40 retrieval fee for one page of billing. She notes that, while this fee is against Federal HIPAA allowable fees, the provider continues to state under Tennessee law that the fee does not apply to them. She recalls that, in her view, federal law trumps state law, but she cannot seem to get the provider to budge. She ends by asking whether they should pay the fee.\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif, involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 8, 2022.\n\nIn an email thread concerning Muhammad Alif MVA 11/08/22, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote from 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines were (502) 357-9971 (D) and (502) 583-4022 ext. 104 (O), and her email address was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new address). The message was addressed to Lisa Jewell of Aptiva Health, with no one copied on the message. The date stamp on this message is November 7, 2024, 11:37:34 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\nOn that same day, November 7, 2024, Lisa Jewell of Aptiva Health sent a reply asking for an update on the case and whether benefits could be released at that time.\n\nEarlier in the correspondence, on July 8, 2024, Lisa Jewell had written to Sarena noting that Farmers had advised benefits were being reserved and that the patient was no longer treating; she asked whether benefits could be released and attached an itemization for review. Sarena responded later that day, July 8, 2024 at 1:31 p.m., explaining that the PIP reservation could not be removed because Mr. Alif\u2019s claim was in litigation and multiple providers would ultimately have a claim to the PIP benefits. She indicated that once it could be determined whether the defense was willing to settle or whether the case would go to trial, they would have a clearer understanding of how those funds should and/or will be split. She also asked Lisa to \u201cdairy out 90-120 days to check back in with us,\u201d and provided her contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (new email address).\n\nIn Lisa Jewell\u2019s earlier reply, dated July 8, 2024 at 12:42 p.m., she stated that Farmers had advised benefits were being reserved and that the patient was no longer treating, and she asked if benefits could be released. She attached an itemization for review. Her signature block identified her as an AR Billing Specialist at Aptiva Health, with contact details including TEL: (502) 909-0772, email ljewell@aptivahealth.com, and website www.aptivahealth.com, plus the office address at 12300 Plantside Drive, Louisville, KY 40299. The email signatures included standard confidentiality language indicating the message and attachments were intended for the named recipients and may contain privileged information.\n\nIn sum, the file reflects a motor vehicle accident case for Muhammad Alif, with a sequence of communications from July 2024 through November 2024. Key points include: ongoing litigation with a PIP reservation in place and multiple providers sharing potential PIP claims; a belief in July 2024 that benefits could not be released due to litigation status; an expectation to reassess in 90\u2013120 days; and a November 2024 update indicating the case was moving to trial, with a trial date set for June 3, 2025, and mediation having failed. The November 7, 2024 correspondence also noted that if anything unforeseen occurred, the office would be contacted with an update.",

On January 21, 2025 at 8:37 AM, Sarena wrote that Mr. Alif\u2019s claim remains in litigation and is currently scheduled to go to trial in May 2025. She requested that Cutting Edge ensure up-to-date medical records, bills, and letters of protection be on file by sending copies of the most recent documents, and she invited any further questions.\n\nAt 9:00 AM on January 21, 2025, Cutting Edge Admin replied to Sarena, asking for an update on the current status of MUHAMMAD ALIF, whose incident date was December 9, 2022 and whose date of birth is April 16, 1961.

The body of this message stated simply: \u201cYes, I have time. what time do you have available?\u201d\n\nEarlier that same day, in the email chain, Dr. Matt DeGaetano replied at approximately 1:51 PM: \u201cHello Aaron, Let\u2019s jump on a call to discuss, do you have time this afternoon?\u201d The thread shows that prior to this exchange, at around 9:30 AM, Aaron Whaley had written to Dr. DeGaetano with a fuller message regarding preparations for Mr. Alif\u2019s upcoming trial in June. In that 9:30 AM email, Aaron explained that he wanted to schedule time to take depositions of Mr. Alif\u2019s treating doctors at Axon Medical Centers, and he asked which doctors would be best for testimony on the case. He expressed a desire for anyone who testified to provide a comprehensive account of all of Mr. Alif\u2019s care, and he named Dr. William Hwang and Dr. Robert Van Boven as his preferred testifying physicians. He closed by saying he looked forward to hearing back and thanking Dr. DeGaetano. The 9:30 AM message was sent from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number listed as 502-583-4022.\n\nIn the 1:51 PM reply, Dr. DeGaetano signed off as: \u201cPersonal Regards, Dr. Matt DeGaetano,\u201d who is the President of Axon Medical Centers. His contact information listed in the signature included O: 972-499-5081 and C: 972-839-2363, and the professional locations noted were Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, El Paso, and Austin.\n\nThe 1:53:24 PM email from Aaron, again in the same thread, reiterated the request with: \u201cYes, I have time. what time do you have available?\u201d This exchange is part of the case record for Muhammad Alif, related to the MVA case dated 11-08-2022, with the communications coordinating depositions and witness testimony ahead of the June trial.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad Alif MVA-11/08/2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This matter concerns Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al. in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 23-CI-005509.\n\nOn March 3, 2025, at approximately 5:13 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Maxwell D. Smith, Esq. of WHT Law, with Kaylee Collins, Muhammad Alif\u2019s Filevine project email address, Aaron Whaley, and Deborah Jackson copied on the message. The subject line identified the case. In the body, Bryce explained that he had a problem with Courtnet the previous day and had to hand-file the matter at the courthouse, and he stated he had no objection to any extension in this regard. He noted that he would need to confirm his client\u2019s availability for the proposed IME date and expected to provide a definite answer within a day or so. He also indicated that the email would include the filing attached today in Jefferson Circuit Court and invited questions if any. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact information, and the message carried the typical attorney-client confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, Bryce prompted the recipient to review the attached filing in Jefferson Circuit Court and reiterated that the message was confidential. The email carried the usual external-email notice and a warning about accessing attachments from external sources.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, at 9:29 AM, Max Smith replied. He acknowledged Bryce\u2019s message and noted as a courtesy that nothing appeared to be filed of record at that time, though Bryce was free to file today if needed. He recalled the prior hearing on the Motion for Extension, during which Judge Maze indicated he would be inclined to grant a reciprocal extension of 30 days if asked. Max stated that he planned to seek such an extension and to request a continuance of the trial because extending deadlines into May would bring substantial activity to occur in a short period. He also intended to request that Bryce\u2019s client appear for IMEs given the injury claims. Max asked Bryce to confirm whether the client would willingly appear on March 28, 2025 for an IME with Edelson Forensics or if he would need to compel the appearance. Additionally, he asked Bryce to supplement discovery responses and to provide dates in April to conduct discovery depositions of each side\u2019s experts.\n\nThe email chain also includes Bryce\u2019s March 3, 2025 message stating, \u201cEXTERNAL EMAIL,\u201d alerting recipients to treat the message accordingly, and reiterating that the attached filing had been submitted to Jefferson Circuit Court.\n\nIn summary, the correspondence between Bryce Koon and Maxwell Smith discusses an extension and trial schedule strategy in Muhammad Alif\u2019s Jefferson Circuit Court case (24-CI-005509), including plans for an IME with Edelson Forensics on March 28, 2025, the potential for a 30-day reciprocal extension, the prospect of a continuance into May, and requests for supplemental discovery responses and April discovery deposition dates, all while noting a recent hand-filed submission due to Courtnet issues.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative recounts the communications surrounding Muhammad Alif, in the case identified as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, Lisa Jewell, AR Billing Specialist at Aptiva Health (ljewell@aptivahealth.com), sent to Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) regarding Muhammad Alif MVA 11/08/22. In that thread, Lisa stated that Farmers had advised benefits were being reserved because the patient was no longer treating, and she attached an itemization for review, asking whether benefits could be released. Later that day, at 1:31 PM, Sarena replied: \u201cGood afternoon Lisa, Thank you so much for reaching out. Unfortunately, at this time, we can not remove the PIP Reservation. Mr. Alif's claim is in litigation and he has a number of providers who will ultimately have claim to the PIP Benefits. Once we can determine if the Defense is willing to settle or if we will proceed to Trial, we can have a better understanding on how those funds should and/or will be split. Please feel free to dairy out 90-120 days to check back in with us.\u201d Sarena\u2019s signature identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and WC Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville address and contact details, and noted the email address as the new one to use.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, Lisa followed up with, \u201cGood Morning, Do you have an update on this case? Can benefits be released yet?\u201d The same day, at 11:38 AM, Sarena replied: \u201cGood morning Lisa, Unfortunately, this claim is moving to Trial. Trial has been set for June 3, 2025. Since Mediation failed and the Defense Counsel's position, I do not anticipate any resolution prior to that date. Should something unexpected happen, we will definitely reach out to your office with an update.\u201d\n\nA subsequent thread shows the ongoing status, including a March 26, 2025 communication. In an email titled FW: Muhammad Alif MVA 11/08/22, Lisa Jewell wrote to Sarena Tuttle, \u201cGood afternoon, I just spoke with the adjuster on this case, and I was told that this case was closed, and benefits were already released a while ago, by the attorney. No one relayed that information in any of the emails I have sent. Benefits are now exhausted. I have requested an exhaust letter. Once I have that letter, balance will be moved to lien.\u201d This message was sent on Wednesday, March 26, 2025, at 16:20:40 +0000.\n\nAdditional contextual details from the threads include that the July 8, 2024 email chain referenced a PIP (Personal Injury Protection) reservation due to ongoing litigation, with multiple providers potentially claiming PIP benefits; the defense\u2019s willingness to settle or proceed to trial would influence how any available funds would be allocated. By November 2024, the case had advanced toward trial, with a firm trial date set for June 3, 2025, and an expectation that no resolution would occur before that date, absent an unexpected development. By March 2025, communication indicated the case status had shifted to a closed/ Exhausted-terminated state per the adjuster, prompting the request for an exhaust letter and plans to move the remaining balance to lien upon receipt of that letter. The records also show the involved parties\u2019 contact details and that the communications occurred under the subject line Muhammad Alif MVA 11/08/22.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nOver the period from July 2024 through March 2025, communications between Lisa Jewell of Aptiva Health and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm tracked the status of Mr. Muhammad Alif\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim arising from a motor vehicle accident on 11/08/2022, and the management of related PIP benefits. The Whaley Law Firm contact information used in these exchanges identifies Sarena M. Tuttle as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: 502-357-9971, O: 502-583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (note: new email address noted in the message). Lisa Jewell\u2019s communications identify Aptiva Health, located at 12300 Plantside Drive, Louisville, KY 40299, with the phone number 502-909-0772 and email ljewell@aptivahealth.com.\n\nOn July 8, 2024, Lisa Jewell wrote that Farmers had advised benefits were being reserved because the patient was no longer treating, and she requested permission to release those benefits, attaching an itemization for review. Sarena Tuttle replied later that day, stating that the PIP reservation could not be removed at that time because Mr. Alif\u2019s claim was in litigation and involved multiple providers who would eventually claim the PIP benefits. She explained that once a determination was made whether the Defense would settle or whether the matter would proceed to trial, they would have a clearer understanding of how the funds should be divided. She advised Lisa to diary a 90- to 120-day follow-up to check back in.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on November 7, 2024, Lisa Jewell sent a message asking for an update and whether benefits could be released yet. In response, Sarena Tuttle sent a message at 11:38 AM on the same day (addressed to Lisa) explaining that the claim was moving to trial, with Trial set for June 3, 2025. She noted that mediation had failed and that the Defense Counsel\u2019s position made any resolution unlikely before the trial date, promising to provide updates should anything unexpected occur.\n\nThat same day, November 7, 2024 at 11:29 AM, Lisa had previously asked, \u201cDo you have an update on this case? Can benefits be released yet?\u201d which precipitated the subsequent reply from Sarena.\n\nEarlier still, on July 8, 2024 at 12:42 PM, Lisa had written that Farmers had advised benefits were being reserved because the patient was no longer treating and asked whether benefits could be released, attaching an itemization for review. Sarena responded at 1:31 PM that day, explaining that the PIP reservation could not be removed at that time because the claim was in litigation and involved multiple providers who would ultimately claim the PIP benefits. She reiterated that a determination about settlement versus trial would clarify how funds should be allocated and suggested checking back in after 90\u2013120 days.\n\nMost recently, on March 26, 2025, at approximately 12:20 PM, Lisa stated in an email that she had spoken with the adjuster who claimed the case had been closed and that benefits had already been released some time ago by the attorney, that no one had relayed this information in prior emails, and that benefits were exhausted. She requested an exhaust letter and indicated that once the letter was received, the balance would be moved to lien.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied at 12:47 PM the same day with a corrective clarification: while the claim may appear \u201cclosed\u201d to the adjuster because the claim had moved into litigation, the claim itself remained viable and set for Trial. She emphasized that no benefits had been released to date, to her knowledge.\n\nIn summary, the Muhammad Alif MVA case remains active and is scheduled for Trial on June 3, 2025, with mediation having failed previously. PIP benefits have not been released to date, and discussions about benefit allocation depend on whether the defense settles or the case proceeds to trial. The communications include multiple inquiries about benefit releases and the legal status of the claim, as well as updates from The Whaley Law Firm indicating ongoing litigation and forthcoming trial-related actions.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif in the matter Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al. The consolidated notes reflect a sequence of communications among the Whaley Law Firm team about upcoming IMEs and a motion to compel.\n\nOn March 27, 2025 at 10:59:15 GMT-04:00, Bryce Koon sent an email to Sarena Tuttle regarding the Muhammad Alif case. He stated that the law firm is going to file a motion to compel, which will require Mr. Alif to appear as ordered by the court. The motion to compel concerns a neuropsychological examination for traumatic brain injury (TBI). Additionally, Bryce noted that Mr. Alif will have a separate independent medical examination (IME) with an orthopedic specialist in June.\n\nEarlier that same day, around 10:53 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote back after speaking with the client. She reported that Mr. Alif is leaving for Dubai in the morning to attend some Derby event. He refused to have the IME rescheduled before his next appointment at the end of April, and she advised that the appointment would likely be about 30 days out anyway. She described the client as combative about attending and noted that while this is a required appearance at some point, they would attempt to reschedule. He then indicated that he would not be available until after May due to extensive travel.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle is a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222.

Her email is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and the note indicates a new email address.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 at 8:12 PM, Aaron Whaley asked, \u201cDoes the client know about this?\u201d in relation to the pending matters.\n\nAlso on March 26, 2025 at 3:55 PM, Deborah Jackson, Legal Assistant to several partners at Vine Center, forwarded a message regarding Mr. Alif\u2019s IME. The forwarded email was addressed to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Max Smith cc\u2019d. Deborah confirmed that they wanted to know whether Mr. Alif planned to appear for the IME scheduled for Friday, March 28, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. with Dr. Richard Edelson. Dr. Edelson\u2019s office is located at 4169 Westport Road, Suite 125, Louisville, KY 40207. Deborah asked for confirmation of Mr. Alif\u2019s plans to attend. She closed with thanks and well wishes.\n\nDeborah Jackson\u2019s signature identified her role as Legal Assistant to George B. Hocker, Ashley K. Brown, Graham D. Barth, Maxwell D. Smith, William J. Barker, II, Kaylee F. Collins, and Christianna A. Livas, and listed Vine Center at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507. Her phone number is 859.422.6000 and fax 859.422.6001, with the firm\u2019s website at www.whtlaw.com. A standard confidentiality notice followed, stating that the information in the email is privileged and confidential and instructing unintended recipients to delete and notify the sender.\n\nThe email thread also included an implicit note that the IME scheduled for Friday, 3/28/25 at 8:30 a.m. with Dr. Edelson was the focus of the confirmation request. The correspondence shows the team coordinating the timing of IMEs (a neuropsych evaluation for TBI and an orthopedic IME in June) in light of the anticipated motion to compel, while managing the client\u2019s travel plans and availability, including a Dubai trip tied to a Derby event.",

      "natural_language": "On March 27, 2025, the Whaley Law Firm circulated a case note regarding Muhammad Alif, the client in Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe et al., file Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The email, sent from Bryce Koon to Sarena Tuttle and copied to Aaron Whaley and Muhammad Alif\u2019s Filevine record, opened with a question about damages: whether there is any information on lost wages or future earning capacity for Mr. Alif.\n\nIn Bryce\u2019s message, he stated that the defense intends to file a motion to compel, which will require Mr. Alif to appear as ordered by the court. He noted that one of the examinations will be a neuropsychological evaluation for a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that there will be a separate independent medical examination (IME) with an orthopedic specialist in June.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:53 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, the litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote back. She reported that she had called the client, who was leaving for Dubai in the morning to attend a Derby. The client refused to have the IME rescheduled before his next appointment at the end of April, stating it would likely be about 30 days out anyway. He was described as combative about attending. She advised that attendance at the IME is a requirement at some point, but she would try to reschedule if possible. He then indicated he would not be available until after May due to extensive travel.\n\nSarena\u2019s contact details are listed in the note: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nEarlier correspondence included a separate thread beginning with a message from Deborah Jackson on March 26, 2025, at 3:55 PM. Deborah asked Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon to confirm whether Mr. Alif plans to appear for his IME on Friday, March 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. with Dr. Richard Edelson. The office address for Dr. Edelson was given as 4169 Westport Road, Suite 125, Louisville, KY 40207. Deborah concluded by asking for a confirmation of Mr. Alif\u2019s plans to appear.\n\nThat March 26 thread also included a prior note from Aaron Whaley at 8:12 PM asking, \u201cDoes the client know about this?\u201d The forwarded message from Deborah Jackson, sent to Aaron and Bryce with Max Smith CC\u2019d, included a confidentiality disclaimer: \u201cInformation contained in this email transmission is privileged and confidential. If you are not the intended recipient, do not read, distribute or reproduce this transmission (including any attachments). If you have received this electronic mail transmission in error, please delete it from your system without copying it, and notify the sender by reply email, so that our records can be corrected. Thank you.\u201d The email signature block for Deborah Jackson identified her as Legal Assistant to several named attorneys at Vine Center, with the firm\u2019s Lexington, Kentucky address and contact information, including the firm\u2019s website.\n\nIn summary, the notes reflect a plan to compel Mr. Alif to undergo IMEs for a TBI (neuropsych) and an orthopedic evaluation in June, questions about lost wages and future earning capacity, Palm Beach travel considerations (Dubai for a Derby) affecting scheduling, and a pending IME confirmation for Friday, March 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. with Dr. Richard Edelson, along with the associated administrative communications and confidentiality notices.",

Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Bryce Koon with copies to Aaron Whaley and Muhammad Alif\u2019s Filevine contact. In her message she explained that she had tried to convey to the client that \u201che has to do this & he just wasn\u2019t trying to hear me.\u201d Regarding lost wages or any form of earnings, she stated that \u201cNo - One minutes he is unemployed, the next he is a travel agent - Very inconsistent & can not get a straight answer from him.\u201d She also noted that she had previously asked about Tax Documents, but described the client as \u201cuncooperative,\u201d so she let it go at the time.

He is also going to have a different IME with an ortho in June.\u201d\n\nAt 10:53?AM on March 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle wrote again: she had \u201cCalled Client - He is leaving for Dubai in the morning for some sort of Derby.\u201d The client was \u201crefusing to have this rescheduled prior to his next appointment at the end of April,\u201d and it was advised that it would likely be \u201c30 days out anyway.\u201d The client was described as \u201ccombative about attending,\u201d and it was noted that rescheduling would depend on whether it could be arranged, with the client subsequently saying he would not be available until after May because he would be traveling a lot.\n\nThe thread also included an earlier message from Aaron Whaley on March 26, 2025 at 8:12?PM asking, \u201cDoes the client know about this?\u201d This prompted a forwarded email from Deborah Jackson dated March 26, 2025 at 3:55?PM regarding Muhammad Alif v.

      "natural_language": "This narrative concerns the case Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickliffe, et al., docketed as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif. The matter was discussed among the Whaley Law Firm team\u2014Bryce Koon, Sarena Tuttle, and Aaron Whaley\u2014with Muhammad Alif listed as a participant in the MVA matter for 11/08/2022. The exchange, dated March 27, 2025, centers on scheduling and preparing for IMEs related to Mr. Alif\u2019s injury case, including a neuropsych evaluation for traumatic brain injury and an orthopedics IME planned for June.\n\nThe thread begins with a forwarded inquiry from Deborah Jackson on March 26, 2025, at 3:55 p.m., regarding whether Mr. Alif plans to appear for an IME on Friday, March 28, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. with Dr. Richard Edelson. The appointment was to take place at Dr. Edelson\u2019s office, located at 4169 Westport Road, Suite 125, Louisville, KY 40207. Deborah requested confirmation from the Whaley firm as to Mr. Alif\u2019s attendance. The message from Deborah was sent to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Sarena Tuttle copied, and Max Smith among the CCs in the forwarded thread.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, at 8:12 p.m., Aaron Whaley asked whether the client knew about the IME arrangement. The following day, March 27, 2025, at around 10:53 a.m., Sarena Tuttle reported that she had called the client and found that he was leaving for Dubai in the morning for some Derby. He refused to have the IME rescheduled before his next appointment at the end of April, was combative about attending, and indicated that the schedule would likely be 30 days out anyway. She noted that this is a requirement at some point but that they would see when they could reschedule, and she added that the client would not be available until after May due to extensive travel.\n\nEarlier on March 27, at around 10:59 a.m., Bryce Koon asked whether there was any information on lost wages or future earning capacity. He also noted that the client would be facing a motion to compel, meaning the client would have to attend when the court directs. He explained that this IME is a neuropsych evaluation for TBI and that there would be another IME with an orthopedic specialist in June.\n\nAlso on March 27, at approximately 11:05 a.m., Sarena wrote that she had tried to explain to Mr. Alif that he has to participate, but he was not listening. Regarding lost wages or earnings, she observed that Mr. Alif\u2019s income status was highly inconsistent\u2014one moment unemployed, the next working as a travel agent\u2014and that she could not obtain a straight answer from him. She noted that tax documents had been previously requested but that the client again was uncooperative, so she let it go at the time. Finally, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019ll call him here in a bit.\u201d\n\nThe conversation continued with the original sender, Bryce Koon, indicating that he would call Mr. Alif soon. The thread also includes Deborah Jackson\u2019s original forwarding message and the standard confidentiality disclaimers typical of the Vine Center and Whaley Law Firm communications, along with the contact signatures for Deborah Jackson and the Whaley Law Firm. The chain reflects ongoing coordination regarding Mr. Alif\u2019s IMEs and the firm\u2019s concern about the client\u2019s cooperation, scheduling conflicts, and the impact on lost wages and future earning capacity analyses.",

This was the first email from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com in this thread, and Sarena cautioned Deborah to exercise caution when clicking links or opening attachments until the email\u2019s authenticity could be validated. In that message, Sarena stated that Mr. Alif would not be attending tomorrow\u2019s IME with Dr. Edelson and requested new dates for review before scheduling with Dr. Edelson for the most efficient scheduling. She also noted that if there were any questions, Deborah should contact them directly to discuss in further detail. Sarena\u2019s signature included her contact details and indicated a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, telephone numbers, and the firm\u2019s website.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Deborah Jackson had replied to the same email group. She said she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would inform the recipients once new available dates were provided. She added that if there should be a cancellation fee for tomorrow, they would forward that information for payment. Her reply also included her role as a legal assistant to several named attorneys and provided the Vine Center address (333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507), a phone number (859.422.6000), a fax number (859.422.6001), and the firm\u2019s website (www.whtlaw.com). The message concluded with a standard confidential notice.\n\nSubsequently, at approximately 11:21 AM, Deborah Jackson\u2019s message reiterated that she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would let the team know when new available dates were provided. She confirmed that if there was a cancellation fee for tomorrow, they would forward it for payment, and she again extended thanks and well wishes for the day.\n\nShortly after, at around 11:24 AM, Sarena responded with thanks, stating that the cancellation-fee issue would require further discussion by the attorneys, since they had never confirmed Mr. Alif\u2019s availability for tomorrow and Deborah\u2019s confirmation email was the first indication that the appointment had been formally scheduled. Sarena signed again with her contact details and noted the new email address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This note summarizes communications regarding IME scheduling for the matter Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe, with the IME scheduled or discussed with Dr. Edelson.\n\nOn March 4, 2025, Maxwell D. Smith, an attorney with WHT Law, sent an email to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend the IME without the need for a Motion to Compel. In reply, Bryce stated that he would discuss the matter with Mr. Alif and would respond if attending without a Motion to Compel did not work. There was no further communication from Whaley Law Firm indicating that Mr. Alif could not attend. The email noted that if there is a cancellation fee, it would be paid by Whaley\u2019s office, and that if court intervention was required, the sending side was willing to file a motion. The signature block of Maxwell D. Smith identified him as an attorney at WHT Law, with the firm\u2019s Vine Center address in Lexington, KY, and included his phone and fax numbers, website, and a confidentiality notice stating that the information in the transmission is privileged and confidential. A standard disclaimer followed, instructing unintended recipients to delete the email and notify the sender.\n\nLater, on March 27, 2025, a thread began regarding IME scheduling. At 11:10 AM, Sarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Deborah Jackson (with initial caution that this was an external email) stating that Good morning Deborah and thanking her for her prior email. She informed Deborah that Mr. Alif would not be in attendance for tomorrow\u2019s IME with Dr. Edelson and asked for new dates for the firm\u2019s review prior to scheduling with Dr. Edelson to enable the most efficient scheduling. She also invited Deborah to contact her directly with any questions. Sarena\u2019s message included her contact information and noted a new email address for correspondence.\n\nAt 11:21 AM, Deborah Jackson replied, stating that she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would advise once Dr. Edelson\u2019s office provided new available dates. Deborah added that if there is a cancellation fee for tomorrow, they would forward it for payment, and she closed with a polite sign-off. Deborah\u2019s message also carried the standard confidentiality notice in her signature block.\n\nAt 11:25 AM, the thread shows another message from Sarena Tuttle, this time with an \u201cEXTERNAL EMAIL\u201d caution banner indicating that the email was from outside the organization. In her message, Sarena thanked Deborah and explained that the attorneys would need to discuss cancellation fees in further detail, because they never confirmed that Mr. Alif would be available tomorrow, and Deborah\u2019s confirmation email was the first the Whaley office had heard that the appointment had been formally scheduled. This message again included Sarena\u2019s contact information.\n\nSeparately, Deborah\u2019s earlier message within this same exchange, dated 11:21 AM, reiterated that she had contacted Dr. Edelson\u2019s office to obtain new available dates and that any cancellation fee for tomorrow would be forwarded for payment. Deborah\u2019s communications repeatedly referenced coordinating new dates with Dr. Edelson\u2019s office to achieve efficient scheduling, and she invited any questions for further discussion.\n\nThroughout this thread, the correspondence shows the parties\u2019 efforts to reschedule the IME with Dr. Edelson, the anticipation of potential cancellation fees, and the willingness to pursue court intervention if necessary. The exchange also reflects the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s administrative updates, including Sarena\u2019s new email address and the standard confidentiality notices in the messages.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022\nClient: Muhammad Alif\n\nThis note summarizes the IME scheduling communications in the matter Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe. The exchanges center on whether Mr. Alif would attend an independent medical examination (IME) with Dr. Edelson, how to handle any potential cancellation, and whether the appointment had been formally scheduled.\n\nThe thread begins with a March 27, 2025 sequence that references an earlier March 4, 2025 email. At 11:10 AM, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm advised Deborah Jackson at WHT Law that Mr. Alif would not be in attendance for tomorrow\u2019s IME with Dr. Edelson and requested new dates for review prior to scheduling with Dr. Edelson for more efficient scheduling. In the same message, Sarena noted that this was the first communication from this sender and included a caution that the message was an external email. The signature blocks for Sarena included her title as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager and The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) with the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nDeborah Jackson replied at 11:21 AM, indicating she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would inform the team once new available dates were provided. Deborah also stated that if there would be a cancellation fee for tomorrow, the firm would forward payment for that fee. Deborah\u2019s message was signed with her role as Legal Assistant to multiple partners at the Vine Center (333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507), and included standard privileged/confidentiality language.\n\nAt 11:25 AM, Sarena responded (labeling the message as external email) and stated, \u201cThank you so much Deborah. As far as the cancellation fees, the attorneys will need to discuss that in further detail, as we never confirmed Mr. Alif would be available tomorrow and your confirmation email was the first our office heard that this appointment was formally scheduled.\u201d Her message again included her Whaley Law Firm signature block and the note to consider the new email address.\n\nEarlier that day, Max D. Smith of WHT Law replied at about 11:27 AM. He noted that an email had been sent to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley on March 4 asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend without the need for a Motion to Compel, to which Bryce responded that he would discuss with Mr. Alif and respond if it did not work. Max added that no other communication about Mr. Alif\u2019s nonattendance had come from Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office, that if there was a cancellation fee it would be paid by Whaley\u2019s office, and that WHT Law would be willing to file a motion for court intervention if needed.\n\nA final note from the same day is the 11:39 AM message from Sarena, addressed to Max Smith with the subject line \u201cRe: Muhammad Alif v Jacquelyn Wickcliffe - IME Scheduling.\u201d In this message, Sarena thanked Max for his response and stated that, according to their records, Max had emailed Bryce on March 4 at approximately 9:29 AM asking whether Mr. Alif would appear voluntarily. Bryce\u2019s reply at 9:34 AM explained that he had an issue with Courtnet the day before and had to hand-file at the courthouse, that he had no problem with any extension, and that regarding the IME he would need to confirm his client\u2019s availability on that date and should be able to provide a definite answer within a day or so. Sarena then asked whether there were additional conversations and whether the office had sent confirmation that the appointment was formally scheduled, requesting copies of any such communications so Whaley could update their records and work toward a resolution. As is customary in her firm\u2019s communications, Sarena\u2019s signature block again noted her role and included the new email address and contact details for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties discussed potential scheduling adjustments with Dr. Edelson, the possibility of cancellation fees, and the prospect of court intervention if necessary to compel attendance. The records also reflect standard email disclaimer language, internal notes about caution for external emails, and the inclusion of signature blocks with the parties\u2019 contact information.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022, concerning client Muhammad Alif and the case Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe, the IME scheduling issues were discussed in a string of email exchanges on March 4 and March 27, 2025. On March 4, Maxwell D. Smith of Whaley | Hocker | Whaley (WHT Law) emailed Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend the IME without the need for a Motion to Compel. Bryce replied at 9:34 a.m., explaining that he had a problem with Courtnet the previous day and had to hand-file something at the courthouse. Bryce stated he had no problem with any extension and that, regarding the IME, he would have to confirm his client\u2019s availability on that date and should be able to provide a definite answer in the next day or so. There is no record of further communications from the Whaley firm indicating that Mr. Alif would be unable to attend on the requested date. The correspondence also noted that if there were a cancellation fee, it would be paid by the opposing office, and that the parties would file a motion if court intervention became necessary.\n\nBy March 27, 2025, a thread of further communications began to address scheduling more directly. At 11:10 a.m., Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm informed Deborah Jackson that Mr. Alif would not be in attendance for tomorrow\u2019s IME with Dr. Edelson and requested new dates for review before scheduling anew with Dr. Edelson to facilitate efficient scheduling. The message included an external-email notice warning and concluded with Sarena\u2019s request for new dates, inviting Deborah to contact them if there were questions.\n\nDeborah Jackson responded at 11:21 a.m., stating that she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would relay new available dates once provided; she also noted that if there were a cancellation fee for tomorrow, the firm would forward it for payment. At 11:25 a.m., Sarena replied, noting that cancellation fees would require further discussion because they had never confirmed Mr. Alif would be available tomorrow, and that Deborah\u2019s confirmation email was the first indication their office had that the appointment had been formally scheduled. She asked for further discussion on fees.\n\nAt 11:27 a.m., Maxwell Smith replied on behalf of WHT Law, clarifying that an email had been sent to Bryce and Aaron on March 4 asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend without a Motion to Compel; Bryce had replied that he would discuss with Mr. Alif and respond if it did not work. Smith stated that there had been no other communication about Mr. Alif being unable to attend, and he noted that any cancellation fee would be paid by the Whaley firm\u2019s office. He added that if court intervention became necessary, they were prepared to file a motion.\n\nFinally, in the afternoon of March 27, 2025, Max Smith sent a formal notice stating that the IME had been scheduled. He noted that the scheduling was referenced in the motion to continue that had recently been heard, and he stated that no further correspondence had been received from The Whaley Law Firm indicating that Mr. Alif would be unable to appear on that date. He concluded by saying the firm was prepared to file a motion if needed. The chain thus records a sequence of scheduling attempts, discussions about attendance, potential cancellation fees, and planned further action related to the IME in the Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe matter.",

      "natural_language": "In the Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe case, IME scheduling discussions took place on March 27, 2025, involving The Whaley Law Firm and WHTLaw. The Whaley firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, informed Max Smith that, without explicit or formal confirmation that an IME appointment with Dr. Edelson had actually been scheduled, she did not have authority to assume payment responsibility at that time. She asked Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon to discuss the matter and to get back to Max, requesting that he hold his motion until they could discuss the issue in further detail. Sarena signaled her new email address in her signature and provided her direct lines: D (502) 357-9971 and O (502) 583-4022 ext 104, with E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting the new address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Max Smith had stated that the notice of scheduling was formal and referenced in the motion to continue that had recently been heard. He noted that there had been no further correspondence from The Whaley Firm indicating that Mr. Alif was unable to appear on the scheduled date and offered to file a motion if needed.\n\nSarena had previously referenced correspondence from March 4, approximately 9:29 a.m., in which Max had asked whether Mr. Alif would appear voluntarily. Bryce had replied at 9:34 a.m. that he would discuss the matter with his client and would confirm availability within a day or so. Sarena asked whether there had been additional conversations and whether your office had sent confirmation that the appointment was formally scheduled, requesting any such documentation to update their records and proceed toward a resolution.\n\nMax had responded that an email had been sent to Bryce and Aaron on March 4 asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend without a Motion to Compel, and Bryce had indicated he would discuss with Mr. Alif and reply if it did not work. He added that no other communication about Mr. Alif\u2019s attendance (or lack thereof) had come from Whaley\u2019s office, and that if there were a cancellation fee, it would be paid by Whaley\u2019s office; if court intervention became necessary, they would file a motion.\n\nDeborah Jackson later joined the thread, reporting that she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office and would relay new available dates once provided. She added that if there was a cancellation fee for tomorrow, Whaley\u2019s office would forward it for payment.\n\nSarena acknowledged Deborah\u2019s message and clarified that, regarding cancellation fees, the attorneys would need to discuss the issue because The Whaley Firm had never formally confirmed Mr. Alif\u2019s attendance for tomorrow and Deborah\u2019s confirmation email was the first explicit notice that the appointment had been formally scheduled.\n\nEarlier in the day, Deborah had signed off as Legal Assistant to several WHTLaw principals and noted that she would forward cancellation fee information if needed. The thread also included standard external-email warnings, indicating caution when clicking links or attachments in messages marked as EXTERNAL EMAIL, as well as signatures listing contact details for Deborah Jackson and the firm.\n\nFinally, in the thread\u2019s later exchange, Sarena stated that this was the first time she had received email from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com, and she urged Deborah and Max to discuss the matter directly. She concluded by reiterating the request for progress on scheduling and the potential need for a motion, while awaiting explicit confirmation that the appointment had actually been scheduled and that payment responsibility had been determined. The exchange underscores ongoing uncertainty about whether the IME with Dr. Edelson had been formally scheduled and who would bear any associated costs, with the possibility of a Motion to Compel or other court action if necessary.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif. This note covers IME scheduling for the case of Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn Wickcliffe, with communications among The Whaley Law Firm and Whitehall/Hubbard firm colleagues regarding the Independent Medical Examination (IME) process, including cancellations, scheduling options, and related fee discussions.\n\nIn late March 2025, communications circulated about whether Mr. Alif would attend the IME and whether the appointment had been formally scheduled. On March 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, in an email to Max Smith of WHT Law (and with copies to Deborah Jackson, Aaron Whaley, Bryce Koon, and Kaylee Collins), noted that without explicit or formal confirmation that the appointment was scheduled, she did not have authority to accept responsibility for any payment at that time and that Aaron and Bryce would need to discuss the matter and get back. She asked that the motion be held until they could discuss it further. This exchange was preceded by an earlier thread in which Sarena flagged the external nature of the emails and advised caution regarding the scheduling matters. The exchange also referenced the possibility of filing a motion if necessary.\n\nMax Smith responded later on March 27, stating that the scheduling notice had been formal and that it had been referenced in a motion to continue that had recently been heard. He noted that there had been no further correspondence from the other side stating that Mr. Alif could not appear on the scheduled date, and he offered to file a motion if needed. In a subsequent message, Sarena asked for clarification about prior communications from March 4, including a March 4 email at about 9:29 a.m. asking whether Mr. Alif would appear voluntarily and a reply from Bryce at 9:34 a.m. indicating that Bryce had a courthouse issue with Courtnet and had to hand-file the matter, but would confirm Mr. Alif\u2019s availability the next day or so. Sarena requested any additional conversations or confirmations that the appointment had been formally scheduled so their records could be updated.\n\nMax\u2019s follow-up stated that an email had been sent to Bryce and Aaron on March 4 asking for confirmation that Mr. Alif would attend without a Motion to Compel, and Bryce had replied that he would discuss with Mr. Alif and respond if the arrangement did not work; no other communication about Mr. Alif\u2019s absence had come from their office. He added that if there were a cancellation fee, it would be paid by The Whaley Law Firm, and that they were willing to file a motion for court intervention if necessary.\n\nSarena replied that, with respect to cancellation fees, the attorneys would need to discuss the matter in detail because The Whaley Law Firm did not confirm Mr. Alif would be available tomorrow, and Deborah Jackson\u2019s email indicating the appointment was formally scheduled was the first their office had heard of such scheduling. Deborah responded that she had reached out to Dr. Edelson\u2019s office for new available dates and would relay them when obtained, and that if there was a cancellation fee for tomorrow, the firm would forward it for payment.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, Deborah\u2019s emails carried external-email warnings and confidentiality notices typical of legal communications. Deborah also noted that she would inform the recipients once Dr. Edelson\u2019s office provided new available dates. The correspondence shows that the parties were navigating whether a cancellation fee would apply and whether the IME could proceed as scheduled, while debate persisted over whether formal scheduling had, in fact, occurred and who bore responsibility for any associated fees.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, Deborah Jackson sent a follow-up message with updates and next steps. She attached an invoice for the cancellation of Mr. Alif\u2019s IME with Dr. Elderson (note the spelling variation in the records). The first available date to reschedule with Dr. Elderson was listed as July 11, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Deborah requested that Sarena confirm whether this date would work for Mr. Alif at her earliest convenience. In addition, Deborah provided available spine-IM E dates with Dr. Stephens in Lexington, Kentucky: June 24, June 25, and June 26, all at 8:30 a.m., and asked which of these dates would work best so they could schedule accordingly. Deborah\u2019s signature block identified her as a Legal Assistant to a group of attorneys, including George B. Hocker, Ashley K. Brown, Graham D. Barth, Maxwell D. Smith, William J. Barker, II, Kaylee F. Collins, and Christianna A. Livas, and she listed Vine Center at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with a phone number and a fax number. The message began with a note that the information contained in the email is privileged and confidential, and included the standard instruction to delete and notify the sender if the message was received in error.\n\nIn sum, the file contains ongoing, unresolved scheduling matters for Muhammad Alif\u2019s IMEs, including a cancellation with Dr. Elderson, an invoice for that cancellation, and proposed new dates for both the IME with Dr. Elderson (7/11/25 at 8:30 a.m.) and spine IMEs with Dr. Stephens (6/24\u20136/26 at 8:30 a.m. in Lexington, KY). The records reflect back-and-forth discussions about scheduling authority, potential fees, and the need for formal confirmation before payment or scheduling could be finalized, along with addresses and contact details for the Vine Center in Lexington and the involved law firms.",

She advised that Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon would need to discuss the matter and to hold any motion until they could contact the other side for further discussion. This reply carried an external email disclaimer indicating the message came from outside their organization.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarena had sent a message asking Max for confirmation about whether the IME could proceed. In her March 27, 2025 message, she thanked him for the clarification and recounted that, according to their records, an email on March 4 at approximately 9:29 a.m. asked if Mr. Alif would appear voluntarily, with Bryce responding at 9:34 a.m. that he needed to hand-file something at the courthouse due to a problem with CourtNet, and that he would confirm Mr. Alif\u2019s availability for the IME in the next day or so. Sarena asked whether there had been additional conversations and whether the office had sent confirmation that the appointment had been formally scheduled, requesting such information to update their records and move toward a resolution.\n\nMax replied that the March 4 email asking for confirmation had been followed by Bryce\u2019s reply and that there had been no further communications indicating that Mr. Alif could not attend the date. He stated that if a cancellation fee existed, it would be paid by the other side, and he warned that they were prepared to file a motion if court intervention was needed.\n\nIn a later note on March 27, 2025 at 11:25 a.m., Sarena again stated that, regarding cancellation fees, the attorneys would need to discuss the matter in more detail because they had never confirmed Mr. Alif would be available the following day, and Deborah Jackson\u2019s confirmation email was the first their office had heard that the appointment was formally scheduled. At about 11:39 a.m., Sarena reiterated the questions about whether additional conversations had occurred and whether any formal scheduling confirmations had been issued, asking for those records to be provided so they could be updated accordingly.\n\nShortly after, at about 11:46 a.m., Max Smith responded that the notice stating the appointment had been scheduled had been formal, and that it had also been referenced in a motion to continue that had recently been heard. He noted that there had been no further correspondence from the opposite party indicating that Mr. Alif could not appear on the scheduled date and reaffirmed their willingness to file a motion if needed.\n\nAround 11:52 a.m., Sarena\u2019s thread included an external-email header reiterating the ongoing discussion; her earlier note concluded with the Whaley Law Firm contact details and a request for resolution.\n\nBy April 1, 2025, Deborah Jackson, the legal assistant for several attorneys at Vine Center, sent a follow-up email to Sarena and Max, attaching an invoice for the cancellation of Mr. Alif\u2019s IME with Dr. Elderson. Deborah explained that Dr. Elderson\u2019s first available date to reschedule was July 11, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., and she asked them to confirm whether that date would work for Mr. Alif as soon as possible. Deborah also shared information about a spine IME with Dr. Stephens, listing Lexington, Kentucky, as the location and providing the dates June 24, June 25, and June 26, all at 8:30 a.m. She requested counsel to advise which of these dates would work best so they could schedule accordingly.\n\nThe correspondence continued, and on April 8, 2025, Deborah sent a follow-up email to Sarena (and copied Max) regarding the IME dates. She asked to be advised as soon as possible whether the proposed dates would work for Mr. Alif so that they could finalize the scheduling, noting that the dates were moving quickly.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the Vine Center address at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, along with the center\u2019s phone and fax numbers. They also included standard confidentiality notices, and email signatures for Deborah Jackson and the members of the involved law firms.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects a back-and-forth about whether the IME appointments could be scheduled, discussions about potential cancellation fees, and confirmation of multiple proposed dates for both a cervical/spine IME (Dr. Elderson for an initial appointment, and Dr. Stephens for the spine IME) in Lexington, KY. The April messages sought timely confirmation from Mr. Alif\u2019s team to lock in the dates, while the March discussions centered on whether scheduling had been formally scheduled and who would be responsible for any related fees or motions.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. The client is Muhammad Alif, and the matter is Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn B. Wickcliffe, et al., 23CI-5509, currently before the Jefferson County Circuit Court.\n\nIn an email dated April 15, 2025, at 3:50 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) wrote to Max Smith regarding scheduling the final pretrial conference. He proposed September 10, 2025, at 11:30 a.m. as a possible time and asked the recipient to confirm that date.\n\nMax D. Smith, an attorney at Vine Center (333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507; phone 859-422-6000; fax 859-422-6001; www.whtlaw.com), replied that September 10 and September 19, 2025, would work for the Defendants. His reply included standard email signatures and cautions about privileged or confidential information.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Tarra L. Mitchell, Judicial Secretary for Division Seven for Judge Melissa Logan Bellows at the Jefferson County Circuit Court (700 West Jefferson Street, Ste. 802, Louisville, KY 40202; phone 502-595-4103; TarraMitchell@KyCourts.net), sent an external email message noting dates the Court had available for a final pretrial conference if the parties were in agreement. The dates listed were August 29, 2025 at 10:00 a.m.; September 10, 2025 at 11:30 a.m.; and September 19, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. The message also included a confidentiality notice typical of Kentucky Court of Justice communications, stating the message is privileged and confidential and should not be read or forwarded by unintended recipients.\n\nIn a follow-up response, Maxwell D. Smith added a caveat about the external origin of the email and stated that, per an order from Judge Maze on March 11, 2025, deadlines had been continued and the trial date reset to October 14, 2025. The new trial date would lead to aligning the final pretrial conference with that date, and he suggested continuing the pretrial to mirror the new schedule.\n\nPrior to these exchanges, Tarra Mitchell had written earlier that afternoon that the case was currently scheduled for a final pretrial conference on May 14, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. She asked whether moving the pretrial to 11:30 a.m. on the same date would work with the calendars of the parties. This message also contained the Kentucky Court of Justice confidentiality notice.\n\nThroughout the thread, standard confidentiality and privilege notices were included in the emails, including explicit warnings not to read or forward communications if the recipient was not the intended addressee. The participants in the discussion included Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm; Max Smith of WHT Law (Vine Center); Tarra L. Mitchell, Judicial Secretary to Division Seven; and references to Judge Melissa Logan Bellows and Judge Maze, with the Jefferson County Circuit Court as the forum. The discussion focused on scheduling the final pretrial conference in relation to the then-pantheon of dates and the revised trial date, with proposed times including August 29, September 10, and September 19 in 2025, and a May 14, 2025 pretrial date being considered for rescheduling to 11:30 a.m.",

In an external email, Sarena confirmed she was seeking clarification about Dr. Stephens\u2019 appointment. She noted that the Order shows July 2, 2025, but Deborah\u2019s letter shows July 3, 2025, and she asked Deborah to confirm which date is correct for the appointment. Sarena\u2019s signature identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her contact numbers were listed as D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address.\n\nThe thread also shows the external-email notice within Sarena\u2019s message.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn B. Wickliffe and Harbor House of Louisville is filed under Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 with client Muhammad Alif. The matter involves communications between The Whaley Law Firm and The WHT Law Firm regarding independent medical examinations (IMEs) and related scheduling, travel reimbursement, and deposition logistics.\n\nIn late April 2025, Deborah Jackson, a legal assistant at WHT Law, advised Sarena Tuttle that the appointment with Dr. Stephens was correct as July 2, 2025, and noted that a letter had contained a typographical error. Specifically, Dr. Stephens\u2019 appointment was set for July 2, 2025 at 8:30 a.m. Deborah signed as Legal Assistant to multiple attorneys and provided the firm\u2019s address at Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with the firm\u2019s phone and fax numbers. She also included the standard privileged and confidential notice applicable to electronic communications, instructing that if the message was received in error, the recipient should contact the sender and delete the message without disclosure.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarena Tuttle had asked Deborah to confirm which date was correct for Dr. Stephens\u2019 appointment, noting that the Order listed July 2, 2025 while a letter indicated July 3, 2025. She identified herself as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, providing her contact information and new email address. Deborah later responded with the clarification that the appointment indeed was July 2, 2025 at 8:30 a.m.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent an external-email message to Max Smith and Kaylee Collins, asking whether his client would rely on the opposing side to coordinate transportation for upcoming IMEs. He stated that Muhammad Alif planned to attend both IMEs and would require transportation to and from each appointment, and he asked for confirmation if their office would handle those arrangements.\n\nFollowing that, on May 12, 2025, Max Smith replied that mileage would be reimbursed at the federal rate and, if a hotel room became necessary for Muhammad Alif\u2019s IME with Dr. Stephens, The Whaley Law Firm would reimburse for reasonable accommodations. Smith noted that there is a Hampton Inn close to Dr. Stephens\u2019 office.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Bryce Koon informed counsel that he had spoken with Dr. William Hwang and that Dr. Hwang was available for deposition on Thursday, July 17, 2025. Dr. Hwang would be deposed via Zoom, with the proceedings starting at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (presented as 11 EST/10 CT). Koon indicated that he was still awaiting dates for Dr. Van Boven and Dr. Fortin, but he expected to have those dates within the next day or so.\n\nThroughout this correspondence, the emails repeatedly carried standard confidentiality and privilege notices, warning recipients that the communications may contain attorney-client privileged information and advising that if any recipient was not the intended recipient, they should delete the message and notify the sender. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details were listed as 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a telephone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. The WHT Law Firm\u2019s contact details were listed as Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with a telephone number of 859-422-6000 and a fax number of 859-422-6001, and the firm\u2019s website was www.whtlaw.com. One Filevine project email address associated with Muhammad Alif was also included: muhammadalifz2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Muhammad Alif v. Jacquelyn B. Wickliffe and Harbor House of Louisville (case Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022), the client is Muhammad Alif. On April 30, 2025, Deborah Jackson, a legal assistant at Vine Center, notified Sarena that the appointment is 7/2/25 as stated in the Order.\n\nSubsequently, on May 8, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, informed counsel that his client plans to attend both independent medical examinations (IMEs) but will require transportation to and from each. He asked whether the opposing office would handle those transportation arrangements and invited any questions or information needed to coordinate.\n\nOn May 12, 2025, Max Smith, an attorney at WHT Law Firm, replied that they would reimburse mileage for the travel at the federal rate and, if Dr. Stephens\u2019 IME requires a hotel, would reimburse for reasonable accommodations as well. He noted there is a Hampton Inn in close proximity to Dr. Stephens\u2019 office.\n\nAlso on May 12, 2025, Bryce Koon indicated that the client would attend the IMEs and reiterated the transportation need, asking for confirmation about who would arrange those logistics.\n\nOn May 13, 2025, Bryce Koon wrote that he had spoken with Dr. William Hwang and that Dr. Hwang was available for deposition on Thursday, July 17. Dr. Hwang is based on Central Time and requested that the deposition begin via Zoom at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 10:00 a.m. Central Time. He also stated that he was still awaiting dates for Dr. Van Boven and Dr. Fortin, but expected to have those within the next day or so.\n\nLater on May 13, 2025, Max Smith sent a message acknowledging the development and stated, \u201cWe will get the notice out for Dr. Hwang.\u201d He signed as Maxwell D. Smith, Attorney for WHT Law Firm.\n\nThat same day, Deborah Jackson sent a separate email noting that a Notice had been filed in the above matter. Max Smith again acknowledged the notice.\n\nFinally, on May 16, 2025, Bryce Koon provided additional scheduling details for the other Zoom depositions: Dr. Robert Van Boven is set to be deposed on Tuesday, July 29, 2025 (pm), and Dr. Claude Fortin is set to be deposed on Wednesday, August 14, 2025 (pm). The notice also reflected ongoing coordination for the IMEs and related logistics.",

The file contains a sequence of email communications dated April 21, 2025 through May 22, 2025, all relating to a Letter of Protection (LOP) for the Muhammad Alif motor vehicle accident matter (MVA) and the corresponding Filevine project entry for Muhammad Alif.\n\nThe earliest entry in the chain shows an email dated April 21, 2025 at 1:24 PM from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Lisset Abundis and other recipients, including Sarena Tuttle and the Muhammad Alif Filevine project email address, with Prime LOP CC\u2019d. The subject of that message was a [EXTERNAL MAIL] thread regarding muhammad alif (born 04/16/1961) with the PDI number 1739174000. In that message, Aaron Whaley states, \u201cLet this email serve as our LOP for the procedures outlined in the letter,\u201d and provides the firm\u2019s contact information: address 712 Lyndon Ln., Louisville, KY 40222; phone number 502-583-4022; fax 502-237-3207; and tax ID 26-4449080. The email was copied to Prime LOP (lop@primemri.com) and to the Muhammad Alif Filevine project email address MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, among others.\n\nLater on April 21, 2025, at 2:05 PM, Lisset Abundis replied to the group, stating: \u201cGood evening, Please see LOP request attached, the client is scheduled on 04/22. Also, please provide me with your offices information.\u201d This message was sent to Aaron Whaley, Sarena Tuttle, and the Muhammad Alif Filevine project address, with Prime LOP cc\u2019d, and included a confidentiality notice.\n\nAlso on April 21, 2025, at 2:57 PM, Lisset Abundis sent another message reiterating the request: \u201cHello, We need a formal letter of protection, with your letter head and it needs to read that your firm will pay us for services rendered.\u201d This message was copied to Aaron Whaley, Sarena Tuttle, the Muhammad Alif Filevine project address, and Prime LOP, and again included a confidentiality notice.\n\nThe thread further shows a confidentiality disclaimer appended to the emails, indicating that protected health information (PHI) and other sensitive information may be included and is confidential and/or privileged.\n\nOn May 16, 2025, at about 5:29 PM (the exact minute is shown with a question mark in the record), Lisset Abundis asked whether there were any updates regarding the LOP.\n\nFinally, on May 22, 2025, at 09:23:47 GMT-04:00, Aaron Whaley sent another external-mail message to Lisset Abundis with the subject \u201cDo you have an example LOP?\u201d The message began with the line \u201cDo you have an example LOP?\u201d and was addressed to Lisset Abundis, with Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com cc\u2019d along with Prime LOP lop@primemri.com.

Key points include the April 21, 2025 sequence establishing and clarifying the LOP, the client\u2019s scheduled date of 04/22, the request for a formal letter on the signer\u2019s letterhead stating the firm will pay for services rendered, the firm\u2019s contact details, the required office information, and ongoing follow-up inquiries as of May 16 and May 22, 2025. The communication chain includes multiple CC\u2019d recipients and a Filevine project address associated with Muhammad Alif.",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns Muhammad Alif, the client in the Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 motor vehicle accident case, and documents a sequence of communications in April and May 2025 between Whaley Law Firm and the LOP liaison about obtaining a Letter of Protection (LOP).\n\nOn April 21, 2025, Lisset Abundis, the LOP Liaison, sent a message requesting a formal letter of protection with the other party\u2019s letterhead and a statement that Whaley Law Firm would pay for services rendered. In response, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm replied later that day, stating that this email would serve as the LOP for the procedures outlined in the letter, and requesting that the bill and results of any study be forwarded as soon as available. He also provided the firm\u2019s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022; fax 502-237-3207; and tax ID 26-4449080.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:05 PM, Lisset Abundis responded to Whaley and Sarena Tuttle, noting that the LOP request was attached and that the client was scheduled on 04/22. She also asked Whaley to provide her with the firm\u2019s office information. Her message included her signature as LOP Liaison and reiterated the confidentiality notice standard to their exchanges, including HIPAA references, and the stipulation that the email is for the named recipient only.\n\nAt 2:57 PM on April 21, 2025, Lisset sent a follow-up confirming the need for a formal LOP and again acknowledging the confidentiality and privacy constraints of HIPAA, Texas Health and Safety Code provisions, and related privacy protections.\n\nOn May 16, 2025, Lisset followed up again to ask whether there were any updates regarding the LOP.\n\nOn May 22, 2025, Aaron Whaley asked whether there was an example LOP available, signaling ongoing coordination and request for a template.\n\nFinally, on May 27, 2025, at 9:14:04 AM (GMT-04:00), Aaron Whaley sent an external-mail message to Lisset Abundis regarding whether an example LOP might exist. The message was copied to Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address (MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Prime LOP (lop@primemri.com). The subject line read: \u201cRe: [EXTERNAL MAIL] muhammad alif 04/16/1961 PDI1739174000.\u201d The thread included continuing references to the external-mail confidentiality notices and HIPAA safeguards typical of these communications.\n\nOther metadata included in the thread shows the case reference Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022, and the client\u2019s name Muhammad Alif. The correspondence also captured standard contact details for the offices involved: Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022; fax 502-237-3207; tax ID 26-4449080. The communications showed distributed copies to the Filevine project email address MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Prime LOP (lop@primemri.com), with several internal recipients such as Sarena Tuttle. The messages repeatedly carried confidentiality notices asserting that HIPAA-protected information is confidential and that review, dissemination, or copying by unauthorized individuals is prohibited.",

The insurance adjuster for the negligent party may ask\nour office to provide medical records for purposes of settling this clear\nliability claim. We would appreciate your cooperation in providing us with\nthose records and bills.\n\nOur law firm will protect your unpaid balance for medical care and\ntreatment of our client/your patient, out of and to the extent of net\nproceeds of any settlement or monetary recovery from the negligent\nthird-party. \u201cNet proceeds\u201d means the gross settlement amount less payment\nof attorney\u2019s fees and attorney\u2019s expenses. Please note that this letter of\nprotection is not a guarantee of payment, but rather is acknowledge the\nfact that we acknowledge and respect the fact that you have agreed to\nprovide necessary medical treatment and wait until the case resolves for\nthe client\u2019s bill to be paid.\n\n---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: Amy Murguia \nDate: Tue, May 27, 2025 at 6:04?PM\nSubject: RE: [EXTERNAL MAIL] muhammad alif 04/16/1961 PDI1739174000\nTo: Aaron Whaley , Lisset Abundis <\nLAbundis@primemri.com>\nCc: Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address <\nMuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com>, Prime LOP <\nlop@primemri.com>\n\nThank you,\n\n*Amy Murguia*\n\nLOP Billing Manager\n\nPhone: 214-442-8903\n\nFax: 214-341-1603\n\n*From:* Aaron Whaley \n*Sent:* Tuesday, May 27, 2025 8:14 AM\n*To:* Lisset Abundis \n*Cc:* Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022 - Filevine Project Email Address <\nMuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com>; Prime LOP <\nlop@primemri.com>\n*Subject:* Re: [EXTERNAL MAIL] muhammad alif 04/16/1961 PDI1739174000\n\nchecking on the example you may have.

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022. Client: Muhammad Alif.\n\nOn June 25, 2025, at 10:25:25 AM Eastern Time, an email was forwarded that began with an instruction to Faye Gaither to draft a letter on letterhead for Mo\u2019s 11/08/2022 case and then forward it to a specified recipient. The sender, Aaron Whaley, addressed Faye and Muhammad Alif\u2019s Filevine project email, asking that the letter be prepared in a formal letter format on letterhead and then sent to the person listed below. The forwarded message contained a draft letter beginning with \u201cTo Whom It May Concern,\u201d noting that Whaley Whaley Law Firm represents the client in connection with treatment for injuries from an automobile accident that occurred on March 9, 2025. The draft letter expresses gratitude for the treating provider\u2019s flexibility regarding the financial aspects of medical treatment, explaining that automobile accident victims are often financially strained due to the negligent party\u2019s and/or the responsible party\u2019s insurer\u2019s failure to accept responsibility and pay for reasonable and necessary medical treatment. It notes that an insurance adjuster may request medical records to settle a clear liability claim and asks for cooperation in providing those records and the associated bills.\n\nThe letter further states that the law firm will protect the unpaid balance for the client\u2019s medical care and treatment \u201cout of and to the extent of net proceeds of any settlement or monetary recovery from the negligent third-party.\u201d It defines \u201cnet proceeds\u201d as the gross settlement amount less payment of attorney\u2019s fees and attorney\u2019s expenses. The letter also clarifies that it is not a guarantee of payment, but rather acknowledges and respects the recipient\u2019s agreement to provide necessary medical treatment and to wait to be paid until the case resolves.\n\nEarlier in the thread, there was a sequence of communications about obtaining a formal Letter of Protection (LOP). On April 21, 2025, Lisset Abundis, the LOP Liaison, emailed Aaron Whaley, Sarena Tuttle, and Muhammad Alif\u2019s Filevine address, requesting a formal letter of protection on letterhead that reads your firm will pay for services rendered. The confidentiality notices accompanying these messages reference HIPAA protections and Texas health and confidentiality laws. In response, on April 21, 2025 at 1:24 PM, Aaron Whaley replied that the email could serve as the LOP for the procedures outlined in the letter and provided the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office address (712 Lyndon Ln., Louisville, KY 40222), phone number (502-583-4022), fax number (502-237-3207), and tax ID (26-4449080). At 2:05 PM that same day, Lisset Abundis acknowledged the receipt and requested the firm\u2019s office information again, noting the client was scheduled on 04/22. Aaron reaffirmed the information in subsequent exchanges.\n\nThe thread shows multiple follow-ups: on April 21, 2025 at 2:57 PM, Lisset confirmed the client was scheduled for 04/22 and reiterated the need for a formal LOP and the office details. On April 21, 2025 at 2:05 PM, Aaron had already provided the office information, and the exchange included repeated listings of the firm\u2019s contact details. On May 16, 2025 at 5:29 PM, Lisset Abundis asked if there were any updates regarding the LOP. On May 22, 2025 at 9:23 AM, Aaron asked whether an example LOP existed. On May 27, 2025, at 8:14 AM, Aaron replied that he was \u201cchecking on the example you may have,\u201d and at 6:04 PM that day, Amy Murguia, the LOP Billing Manager, replied with a brief \u201cThank you,\u201d message, cc\u2019ing the relevant parties, including Muhammad Alif and Prime LOP.\n\nThe May 27, 2025 correspondence was part of a broader exchange involving the LOP process, with the chain including messages from Aaron Whaley and Lisset Abundis dating back to April and May 2025. The messages reference the formalization of a Letter of Protection and attaching or forwarding the bill and results of any studies, along with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details. Throughout the thread, confidentiality notices accompany the emails, outlining protections under HIPAA and Texas law and warning that the communication is intended only for the named recipient or entity.\n\nIn sum, the case pertains to Muhammad Alif\u2019s motor vehicle accident (MVA) case identified as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022, with the auto accident occurring on March 9, 2025. A June 25, 2025, email instructed Faye Gaither to convert the draft into a formal letter on letterhead for Mo\u2019s case and to forward it to the intended recipient. The draft letter communicates the firm\u2019s representation regarding the client\u2019s medical treatment, requests cooperation in providing medical records and bills, and explains the protection of the client\u2019s unpaid medical balances to the extent of net proceeds from any settlement, while clarifying that the protection is not a guarantee of payment. The communications also document an ongoing effort to establish a formal Letter of Protection, including multiple exchanges between the Whaley Law Firm, LOP Liaison, Prime LOP personnel, and the client\u2019s file, with details such as the firm\u2019s address (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222), phone (502-583-4022), fax (502-237-3207), and tax ID (26-4449080).",

      "natural_language": "This narrative covers the correspondence related to the case Muhammad Alif v. Harbor House, et al., identified as Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022, on behalf of client Muhammad Alif. The chain of emails centers on mediation scheduling, contemplated mediators, and an invoiced independent medical examination (IME).\n\nThe matter\u2019s email history began in August 2025 with Deborah Jackson of Vine Center (Lexington, KY) sending a message that included an attached proposed Agreed Order on behalf of Max Smith, asking for permission to add Deborah\u2019s signature and tender the order. Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm replied on August 7, 2025, stating, \u201cThat works for me. You have my permission to sign.\u201d The email traffic surrounding the case includes the Filevine project reference Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022, with the Filevine project email address MuhammadAlifZ2328962@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nOn August 25, 2025, Deborah sent another message with an attachment: an invoice from Dr. Edelson\u2019s office for the rescheduled IME set for October 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m., directing that payment be remitted directly to Dr. Edelson at the address shown on the invoice and inviting any questions or concerns about the invoice. The following day, August 26, 2025, Max Smith followed up separately, requesting proposed mediators for the case so that dates could be set and the mediation could be scheduled. He suggested Pete Palmer or Larry Church as potential mediators but indicated openness to other options as well.\n\nBy October 14, 2025, the mediation scheduling effort continued. At 4:29 a.m. that day, an opening message asked, \u201chow about 11/21?\u201d The same day, Deborah Jackson sent a subsequent message listing mediator availability from Larry Church, stating that he had dates that work for them: 11/21, 12/2 pm, 12/3 am, 12/8 pm, 12/19, 12/22 pm, and 12/23, and asked to be advised whether any of these dates would work for the office and for the plaintiff. The thread shows Deborah\u2019s signature block with Vine Center\u2019s contact information, including 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507; P 859.422.6000; F 859.422.6001; www.whtlaw.com, and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nIn the same exchange, Aaron Whaley replied at 11:07 a.m. (with an external email notice) that he was good with the mediators proposed by Deborah, indicating his acceptance of Larry Church (and any other mediator suggested) for the mediation.\n\nThe email trail also contains the earlier mediation-related discussions from August 2025. Max Smith\u2019s August 26, 2025 message explicitly asked for proposed mediators so that dates could be secured, with a preference for Pete Palmer or Larry Church, while expressing openness to other options. Deborah\u2019s August 25 message regarding Dr. Edelson\u2019s IME invoice and the August 7 and August 5 messages about the Agreed Order show concurrent steps toward settlement tactics and case management.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the emails include external-email banners, reflecting that some communications originated from outside the recipient\u2019s organization. The participants consistently referenced the plaintiff Muhammad Alif, the defendants Harbor House and related parties, and the Filevine project address, with the mediation planning and IME arrangements remaining central to the discussion. The communications were conducted through the Vine Center address and Whaley Law Firm, with the signature blocks showing the respective contact details and the file-specific Filevine address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Muhammad-Alif-MVA-11-08-2022 concerns Muhammad Alif and Harbor House, et al. The file shows a sequence of mid-2025 email communications among counsel and support staff regarding mediation, an agreed order, and a rescheduled IME. The header of the correspondence identifies the matter as Re: Muhammad Alif v. Harbor House, et al., with Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sending the message to Max Smith of WHT Law, CC\u2019ing Deborah Jackson and the Muhammad Alif MVA 12/09/2022 Filevine project email address. The date on the top message is October 14, 2025 at 11:07:02 GMT-04:00, and the sender notes that he is \u201cgood with those mediators.\u201d\n\nThe timeline begins with an August 5, 2025 exchange in which Deborah Jackson, legal assistant to several partners at WHT Law (George B. Hocker, Ashley K. Brown, Graham D. Barth, Maxwell D. Smith, William J. Barker II, Kaylee F. Collins and Christianna A. Livas), forwarded a proposed Agreed Order on behalf of Max Smith for review and consideration. She asked for confirmation whether they had permission to add Aaron Whaley\u2019s signature and tender the same. The message was circulated within the firm and included standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of the firm\u2019s email transmissions.\n\nOn August 7, 2025, Aaron Whaley replied, indicating that the proposed order \u201cworks for me\u201d and that he gave permission to sign. His response was marked as external email, with the accompanying caution that it originated outside the organization and that recipients should validate its authenticity before acting on it.\n\nA subsequent August 25, 2025 message from Deborah Jackson attached an invoice from Dr. Edelson\u2019s office for a rescheduled independent medical examination (IME) originally set to occur earlier in the case. The IME was rescheduled for October 24, 2025, at 8:30 a.m. Deborah requested that payment be remitted directly to Dr. Edelson at the address listed on the invoice and invited any questions or concerns regarding the invoice. Deborah\u2019s signature block shows her role and the firm\u2019s contact information, followed by the customary confidential notice.\n\nThe following day, August 26, 2025, Max Smith sent a reply to Aaron Whaley asking for proposed mediators so that dates could be scheduled and the matter could be put on the calendar. He suggested Pete Palmer or Larry Church as potential mediators but stated he was open to other options as well. The message was signed by Max Smith and included his firm\u2019s contact details and standard confidentiality language.\n\nFinally, on October 14, 2025, Aaron Whaley responded with a succinct confirmation that he was good with the mediators discussed. The thread includes the same Filevine project email address circulated in the CC line, and the chain shows ongoing collaboration among the teams at Whaley Law Firm and WHT Law Firm regarding mediation, the Agreed Order, and the IME scheduling.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the communications reflect standard firm practices: proposed documents requiring sign-off, conditional approvals to sign, a request to set mediator dates, and an invoiced IME with payment instructions, all within the context of the Muhammad Alif v. Harbor House matter. The exchanges include the expected legal-support staff roles and internal confidentiality notices, and they align with the case file\u2019s timeline and mediation planning.",
