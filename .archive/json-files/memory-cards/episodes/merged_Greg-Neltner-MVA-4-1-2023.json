I understand you are advocating for your\ninsured. Please see the attached response to our open records request.\nThere is no body cam footage. The important information is the police\nreport, which chronicles what your insured said to the officer at the\nscene, which is consistent with both your insured's statement and Mr.\nNeltner's.Your insured says they were rearended. The police report says\nthe same. What is crucial about the police report is what it claims your\ninsured said. It says she crossed three lanes of traffic to get onto the NB\n75 ramp, and as she did so, she turned in front of my client. While the\nofficer cannot testify to what happened since he did not see it, he can\ntestify to what your insured said. He based his liability decision on what\nyour insured said. In the recorded statement, my client said he did not see\nyour insured. That is consistent with the accident report as well, which\nsays that your insured \"suddenly turned in front of him, leaving him no\ntime to react.\" The damage to your insured's vehicle is listed as 7\no'clock, which would be consistent with her statement about crossing the\nthree lanes of traffic to the left.\n\nThanks.\n\nOn Thu, Nov 30, 2023 at 3:58?PM Amy Morris \nwrote:\n\n> Good afternoon,\n>\n>\n>\n> This is the email I sent yesterday after receiving the voicemail.

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: FW: PROGRESSIVE 23-6275504.\n\nIn late November 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm forwarded to Progressive an attached response to Whaley’s open records request regarding the Progressive files on Greg Neltner’s motor vehicle accident matter (Progressive 23-6275504). In his message, Whaley thanked Amy Morris for the update and stated that there is no body camera footage. He emphasized that the key information is the police report, which he said chronicles what Progressive’s insured told the officer at the scene and that this account is consistent with both Progressive’s insured’s statement and Mr. Neltner’s account. He noted that Progressive’s insured says she was rear-ended, and that the police report states the same. He also highlighted what the police report claims your insured said: that she crossed three lanes of traffic to get onto the northbound I-75 ramp and, as she did so, she turned in front of Mr. Neltner. Although the officer did not witness the incident and cannot testify to what happened, Whaley stated that the officer can testify about what Progressive’s insured said, and that the officer based his liability decision on that statement. Whaley further noted that in Greg Neltner’s recorded statement he said he did not see Progressive’s insured, a detail that aligns with the accident report’s language that Progressive’s insured “suddenly turned in front of him, leaving him no time to react.” Whaley added that the damage to Progressive’s insured vehicle is listed as “7 o’clock,” which he argued would be consistent with her claimed three-lane leftward crossing.\n\nAmy Morris replied later that day with a message dated November 30, 2023. In that reply, she stated that the situation is a word-vs-word claim at this time. She explained that Progressive’s insured asserts she was rear-ended, while the statement from Mr. Neltner’s side says he did not know what happened and did not see their vehicle. Morris noted that the police report presents a third version. She indicated Progressive was seeking body camera footage to review what was actually said and viewed at the scene of the loss, and she stated that, given the information available, Progressive was advocating for their insured.\n\nThe email thread includes earlier communications as well. On October 17, 2023, Amy Morris sent to Aaron Whaley (and Justin Whaley) a message stating, “Please see the attached formal response to the demand for Gregory Neltner.” This was accompanied by the Progressive signature block and a note that the formal response had been attached.\n\nEarlier, on June 28, 2023, Amy Morris had written to Aaron Whaley (and others) asking whether an email address could be provided for Jessa, in the context of the Progressive matter. The June 28, 2023 messages included the standard Progressive signatures and contact details.\n\nOn November 9, 2023, Amy Morris sent another note stating that she had received a voicemail but it was unclear who it was from, and that Progressive still stood by its liability decision and was waiting to obtain bodycam footage.\n\nOn November 29, 2023, 2:05 PM, Morris again referenced the Progressive 23-6275504 matter, noting that a response had previously been sent to Aaron on October 17. The content of that November 29 note reiterates the thread’s status and the prior October 17 document.\n\nIn sum, the correspondence reveals Progressive’s position that the police report contains crucial statements attributed to their insured, including the claim that she crossed three lanes to the NB I-75 ramp and turned in front of Mr. Neltner, with the police officer basing liability on that statement. Greg Neltner’s own recorded statement asserts he did not see Progressive’s insured, aligning with the report’s characterization that she suddenly turned in front of him. The damage description on the insured’s vehicle is noted as occurring at “7 o’clock,” which aligns with the insured’s three-lane-crossing narrative. Progressive has repeatedly requested bodycam footage to verify the scene’s statements and is advocating for their insured while maintaining its liability position, subject to the bodycam review.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. The matter centers on correspondence related to Progressive file 23-6275504 and involves attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and Progressive Claims Specialist Amy Morris, with Greg and Cecelia Neltner as the affected party.\n\nOn December 6, 2023, at 4:19 PM (Eastern Time), Aaron Whaley sent an external email to Amy Morris requesting that Progressive share the photos from the scene. Whaley stated that he had Greg and Cecelia Neltner’s statements and that Progressive had its own insurance statement. He noted that all parties agree the incident was a rear-end collision, and that the sole dispute concerns whether Progressive’s insured drove across three lanes of traffic to pull in front of his client; Whaley asserted that the insured’s police statement admitting the lane-crossing is strong and admissible evidence. He asked how the time and location of the loss could be wrong and commented that, in the end, it would be his client’s word and the police officer’s word against the insured’s.\n\nAmy Morris replied later that day, explaining that there are discrepancies in the police report regarding the time and location of the loss. She stated that their insured claimed they were sitting still at a red light when rear-ended, and that Progressive’s damage photos support a direct rear-end collision. Based on the information available, she said Progressive was standing by its liability denial and requested any evidence from Whaley to review in support of the other stance.\n\nEarlier communications in the thread show Whaley’s prior exchanges. On November 30, 2023, at 4:15 PM, Whaley thanked Morris for the update and referenced an attached response to an open records request. He indicated that there was no body camera footage and emphasized that the police report was the crucial document, detailing what the insured said to the officer at the scene and aligning with both the insured’s statement and Greg Neltner’s account. He noted that the police report stated Progressive’s insured “crossed three lanes of traffic to get onto the NB 75 ramp, and as she did so, she turned in front of” Whaley’s client. While the officer could not testify to what occurred since he did not witness it, he could testify to what the insured said. He pointed out that the officer based his liability decision on the insured’s statements. The recorded statement from Greg Neltner indicated he did not see the insured, and the accident report described the insured as having “suddenly turned in front of him, leaving him no time to react.” The damage to the insured’s vehicle was listed as 7 o’clock, which Whaley argued was consistent with the insured’s statement about crossing three lanes to the left.\n\nIn another exchange from November 30, 2023, at 3:58 PM, Amy Morris reiterated that this was a word-vs-word case. The insured claimed they were rear-ended, while the client stated he did not know what happened and did not see the other vehicle. Morris referenced a third version in the police report and reiterated a desire to review bodycam footage, maintaining that Progressive was advocating for its insured given the information available at that time.\n\nEarlier emails in the thread include Amy Morris’s messages to Whaley from November 29, 2023, at 2:05 PM, in which she stated she had received a voicemail and that Progressive remained by its liability decision, awaiting bodycam footage for review. A prior message from November 9, 2023, at 12:24 PM noted that the reply was sent to Aaron Whaley on October 17, 2023, and acknowledged ongoing discussion about the file. On October 17, 2023, Morris attached a formal response to the demand for Gregory Neltner. And on June 28, 2023, Morris asked Whaley to provide an email address for Jessa, also including her contact information and signature.\n\nThe case file also contains standard contact details for the parties: Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone number 502-583-4022; Amy Morris of Progressive Insurance Companies, with address at 9520 Ormsby Station Road, Suite 200, Louisville, KY 40223, and direct lines and email as noted in the correspondences. The thread ends with Aaron Whaley’s signature block reiterating his firm’s address and contact information.",

It appears the main discrepancy is that\nyour insured says she had been sitting at the light for a couple of\nminutes, and the police report says that your insured cut across three\nlanes of traffic to turn left. In doing so, she turned suddenly in front of\nmy client. In the absence of anything else, this would be my client's word\nvs. your insured's word. However, when your insured makes the statement\nthat she had been sitting at the light for a couple of minutes, I will get\nto call the police officer in rebuttal. He will get to testify to what she\ntold him at the scene. The police report makes it clear that the narrative\nhe put in the report came from both parties. Then it will come down to\nwhether the jury believes your insured over my clients and the police\nofficer. That is a tough position to be in at trial.\n\nOn Tue, Dec 12, 2023 at 1:32?PM Amy Morris \nwrote:\n\n> Good afternoon,\n>\n>\n>\n> Sorry, was out of office on Thur and Fri.

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023 involve Greg Neltner and Progressive Insurance in a motor-vehicle accident matter identified as PROGRESSIVE 23-6275504. The core dispute centers on fault for a rear-end collision in which Progressive’s insured apparently crossed lanes to pull in front of Greg Neltner. Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm represents Greg Neltner, and Amy Morris is the Progressive claims specialist handling the file. The exchange spans multiple emails between October 2023 and December 2023, with a focus on conflicting accounts of how the incident occurred and what the police report shows.\n\nThe discussion began with an October 17, 2023 email from Amy Morris to Aaron Whaley and Justin Whaley, attaching Progressive’s formal response to the demand for Gregory Neltner. The thread then shows a sequence of later messages in which the parties dispute what happened and what the police report reflects. By late November and early December 2023, the disagreements had become more concrete: Progressive’s insured says she had been sitting at a red light waiting to turn for a couple of minutes, while the police report indicates that she cut across three lanes of traffic to turn left and, in doing so, turned suddenly in front of Greg Neltner. The parties acknowledge the collision as a rear-end event, but the implication is that the insured’s lane-changing maneuver is what caused the incident, a point contested by Greg Neltner’s side.\n\nOn November 30, 2023, Aaron Whaley asked Amy Morris to share photos, specifically inquiring whether the photos were taken at the scene. He stated that the evidence before them included statements from Greg and Cecelia Neltner and the insured’s statement, and acknowledged that everyone agrees it was a rear-end collision. He emphasized that the critical question was whether the insured drove across three lanes to pull in front of Greg Neltner, noting that the only evidence of that maneuver would be the insured’s statement to the police officer who prepared the scene narrative. He also pointed out that the officer could testify to what the insured said, since the officer relied on those statements in making a liability decision, and that Greg Neltner’s recorded statement indicated he did not see the insured. He highlighted that the accident report described the insured as having “suddenly turned in front of him, leaving him no time to react,” and he noted that the insured’s vehicle damage was listed as 7 o’clock, supposedly consistent with the cross-lane left-turn scenario.\n\nAmy Morris responded on December 6, 2023, stating that the police report contained several discrepancies concerning the time and location of the loss. She summarized Progressive’s insured as claiming to be sitting still at a red light when rear-ended and pointed to Progressive’s damage photos supporting a direct rear-end impact. Based on the information available, Progressive maintained a liability denial and invited any evidence that could support the other side’s position for review.\n\nOn December 6, 2023, later that afternoon, Aaron Whaley replied, requesting copies of photos and clarifying that there was no body-camera footage available. He reiterated the evidentiary posture: Greg and Cecelia Neltner’s statements on one hand, Progressive’s insured’s statement on the other, with a consensus that the collision was a rear-end event. He emphasized that the crucial issue was whether the insured crossed three lanes to pull in front of Greg Neltner, noting that the only evidence for that maneuver was the insured’s statement to the responding officer. He described the officer’s liability decision as based on what the insured said and pointed out that Greg Neltner’s recorded statement stated he did not see the insured, which aligned with the police report’s account that the insured “suddenly turned in front of him, leaving him no time to react.” He also mentioned that the insured’s vehicle damage being listed at 7 o’clock would be consistent with her account of crossing three lanes to the left.\n\nOn December 12, 2023, Amy Morris replied that she had been out of the office on Thursday and Friday but would share the requested information if the other party would share photos of their client’s damage. She explained that Progressive’s insured’s statement differed from what was in the police report and that the other party’s client had not seen Progressive’s insured. She acknowledged a discrepancy in the reported time and location and described the police report’s sequence as Burlington Pike, then KY 18, then the off-ramp. She noted that maps suggested Burlington Pike is KY 18 and that the loss occurred at the light where the insured was waiting to get onto the ramp, calling that portion a confusing part of the narrative.\n\nThat same day, December 12, 2023, at 1:32 p.m. (approximately), Amy’s message conveyed her continuing concern about the discrepancies between the insured’s statement and the police report, including the location and timing issues, and she reiterated Progressive’s liability position for review upon receipt of additional information to compare against the insured’s account and any photos.\n\nFinally, later on December 12, 2023, Aaron Whaley responded that the central dispute remained the insured’s claim that she had waited at the light for a couple of minutes, versus the police report’s description of her crossing three lanes to turn left and pulling in front of Greg Neltner. He stated that, in the absence of other corroboration, it would be a matter of the plaintiff’s word against your insured’s word, but if the insured’s claim that she had waited at the light for a couple of minutes were true, he would call the police officer to testify to what the insured told him at the scene. He noted that the police report’s narrative appeared to have come from both parties and that the ultimate question would be whether the jury believed Progressive’s insured over Greg Neltner and the police officer—a difficult position to be in at trial.\n\nIn summary, the record reflects an ongoing, back-and-forth exchange over fault in a rear-end collision between Greg Neltner and Progressive’s insured, with key evidentiary points centering on discrepancies between the insured’s account (waiting at a red light to turn, no lane-crossing), the police report’s account (the insured crossing three lanes to pull in front of Greg), the jurisdictional location sequence (Burlington Pike, KY 18, NB 75 ramp), and the availability of photos or body-camera footage to corroborate the narratives. The file also shows that Progressive’s counsel sought to rely on the police officer’s testimony about statements made at the scene and on the police report’s portrayal of the insured’s statements, while Greg Neltner’s side emphasized the consistency of their statements and the potential weight of the officer’s testimony, with the liability decision likely resting with how a jury would assess credibility.",

On June 11, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Greg Neltner regarding the written discovery requests from the defense attorney. In that message, she thanked Greg and said she would forward the requests to Bryce for final review and drafting. She also noted that, in the meantime, she would forward a verification page via DocuSign for Greg’s execution. The message was signed with Sarena M. Tuttle’s contact information and included a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nEarlier, on June 10, 2024, there was an exchange in which Sarena sent Greg and Cecelia an email containing the discovery requests from the defense attorney in Greg’s claim. She stated that there was a packet for each of them, although the questions would be almost identical, and she emphasized that each person should provide their own independent responses. She requested that they provide a complete list of all providers they saw for treatment and that they include their primary care provider as well. She also asked them to include a personal description of the accident from their own point of view. She invited them to contact the office directly if they had any questions. This message was again signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, with the same firm contact details and the reminder to note the new email address.\n\nThere is a note indicating that Greg Neltner replied later that day, around 6:35 PM, but the content of his reply is not included in the record. The June 11, 2024 follow-up from Sarena confirms the plan to route the discovery requests to Bryce for final review and drafting and to provide Greg with a DocuSign verification page for execution. The communications reference The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and list the direct line, main office line, and Sarena’s email address as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (with a note that this is a new email address), along with her office and direct phone numbers.

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023 concerns client Greg Neltner. The note outlining the Neltner v. Cohara matter is drawn from an email exchange dated June 17, 2024, between The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group, regarding discovery in the case.\n\nIn the morning of June 17, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) sent an email to Josh Leckrone, Esq., a member of Richardson Law Group (771 Corporate Dr. Suite 900, Lexington, KY 40503; phone 859-219-9090; fax 859-219-9292; email josh@RichardsonLawGrp.com; website www.RichardsonLawGrp.com). In his message, which was cc’d to Maeve Weihl and Aaron Whaley, he stated that he had received Richardson’s letter and planned to have his clients’ discovery responses back to them by the end of the week. He also noted that, upon reviewing his files, it did not appear that they had received Richardson’s clients’ responses to the discovery requests that had been served with the Complaint, and he asked for guidance on when those answers might be expected. This email included a caution regarding external email and a standard attorney-client privilege notice.\n\nShortly thereafter, at approximately 10:06 AM, Josh Leckrone replied: “Bryce, we should have those to you this week.” His message was followed by his full signature block, which identified him as a Member of Richardson Law Group and provided his contact information (771 Corporate Dr. Suite 900, Lexington, KY 40503; phone 859-219-9090; fax 859-219-9292; email josh@RichardsonLawGrp.com; website www.RichardsonLawGrp.com) and a confidentiality/privilege notice common to the firm’s communications. The reply also carried the firm’s environmental reminder to consider printing less.\n\nA short time later, at 10:07:30 AM, Bryce Koon replied to Josh with a brief, “Sounds good, thanks Josh.” The thread then includes the standard firm notices and confidentiality language that accompany these communications, reiterating the message’s intent and restrictions on distribution and use. The thread also shows that the communication was part of standard, ongoing correspondence among counsel regarding the discovery process in Neltner v. Cohara.",

Sarena noted that every time they had attempted to obtain Cecelia’s records from Children’s Hospital, the hospital indicated that their authorization to obtain those records had been revoked by Cecelia. Sarena also advised that she would be sending documents for Cecelia to sign via DocuSign and instructed Cecelia to follow the prompts to execute the documents from any electronic device without printing them.\n\nIn the same thread, Sarena addressed Greg, informing him that they were also needing a few things from him. She said that they had sent Greg some documents via DocuSign for his execution but had not yet received them back. She reiterated the need for a copy of Greg’s driver’s license and/or state ID and his health insurance cards. Sarena additionally requested that Greg provide the name of his Primary Care Provider (PCP) and the names of any other doctors he had seen in the past twenty years or so. She closed by inviting either party to contact The Whaley Law Firm directly at (502) 583-4022, ext. 104, or ext. 114 with any questions. The signature block followed, identifying Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and email (E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), along with a note to please use the new email address.\n\nLater that day, on Friday, July 12, 2024, at 2:01 PM (time indicated with an uncertain formatting), Cecelia Neltner replied. She wrote that she had a lot going on and had lost track of what she still needed to do. She asked if it was possible for The Whaley Law Firm to send her the documents and/or a list of tasks she needed to complete, noting that her email was heavily backed up and she could not locate all of the firm’s emails. She expressed that receiving those items would be very helpful.\n\nThe thread also contains earlier correspondence from June 2024. On Tuesday, June 11, 2024, at 10:24 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Cecelia. She thanked Cecelia and then explained that it appeared Cecelia had answered her father’s set of questions. Sarena directed Cecelia to review the initial email and to provide her own answers to the set propounded to Cecelia, emphasizing that the cover letter and the emboldened title would bear Cecelia’s name, not her father’s.\n\nThe chain shows an earlier exchange on Monday, June 10, 2024. At 11:44 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent Greg and Cecelia a message explaining that the attached Discovery Requests from the Defense Attorney in their claim had been provided. The message noted that there was a packet for each of them, and while the questions would be almost identical, each person should provide their own independent responses. Sarena requested that both Greg and Cecelia supply a complete list of the providers each had seen for treatment, including their PCP, and asked them to include a personal description of the accident from their own viewpoint. She welcomed questions and offered to discuss them further.\n\nThe thread also indicates that Cecelia had sent a message on Monday, June 10, 2024, at 7:09 PM, though the contents of that message are not shown in the record excerpt provided.\n\nThe contact information for Sarena M. Tuttle, as listed in the signature blocks, includes her role as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), the direct line (D: 502-357-9971), the office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a new email address. The Whaley Law Firm’s general contact details, including the phone number for general inquiries and the extension numbers referenced above, are consistently referenced across the messages.",

Katie asked Sarena to provide a few dates in mid to late September when their clients would be available for depositions. The message included Katie’s request to identify suitable dates for the depositions.\n\nIn response, sent on August 19, 2024, Sarena Tuttle indicated that their calendar was pretty open for September. She asked Katie to confirm which of the listed dates would be available for both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions, and she provided the following dates: September 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, and 26. Her reply came with her role noted as Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and she reiterated the need to coordinate availability for both sides.\n\nOn August 21, 2024, Katie Nelson replied with proposed specifics. She stated that her client’s deposition was available in the afternoon on either September 17 or September 25. She proposed hosting the depositions at Richardson Law Group’s office in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, with Plaintiff depositions beginning at 10:00 AM and her client’s deposition to follow at 1:00 PM or shortly thereafter.\n\nThe correspondence reflects accompanying email notices and standard confidentiality disclosures common to electronic communications, as well as the contact details for the sending and receiving offices. The participants included Katie Nelson (Richardson Law Group) and Sarena Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), with several CC’d colleagues from both firms. The case title, dates, and deposition logistics are all consistent with coordinating Plaintiff and Defendant depositions for the Neltner v. Cohara matter.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nBetween mid-August and late August 2024, the parties coordinated deposition dates for the Neltner v. Cohara matter. On August 14, 2024, Katie Nelson, an associate with Richardson Law Group, followed up with Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, asking for a few mid- to late-September dates when the plaintiff and, if possible, the defendant could be available for depositions.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied on August 19, 2024, noting that her calendar was pretty open for September and asking Katie to confirm which of the dates Sept 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, or 26 would work for both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions. In her signature she identified herself as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and included her contact details, with an explicit “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nOn August 21, 2024, at 3:31 PM, Katie Nelson responded with specifics: her client would be available for the deposition in the afternoon on either September 17 or September 25, and Richardson Law Group was willing to host the depositions at their office in Ft. Mitchell, starting with the Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 AM, with her client’s deposition to follow at 1:00 PM or shortly thereafter. Katie’s signature block included her title (Associate), office address (334 Beechwood Road Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017), phone and fax numbers, email (KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com), and website (www.RichardsonLawGrp.com). The message also contained the standard environmental note and a confidentiality notice typical of electronic mail transmissions, along with the customary guidance to contact Richardson Law Group if the message was received in error.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on August 14, 2024, Katie had asked for dates in mid- to late September for depositions, and on August 19, 2024, Sarena had provided the open-availability window and listed the candidate dates for depositions as Sept 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, and 26, inviting confirmation of which of those would accommodate both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions. The August 21 exchanges reflect a plan to host depositions at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office, with the Whaley clients located about 15–20 minutes from that office, and a scheduling question about whether two plaintiff depositions could fit in a 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM block or if only Greg Neltner’s deposition would be pursued.\n\nIn summary, the depositions were being arranged with the understanding that the plaintiff would be deposed in the afternoon on September 17 or 25, the firm hoping to host at the Richardson office, and the 10:00 AM plaintiff deposition and a 1:00 PM defendant deposition (Greg Neltner) or close timing were contemplated, subject to final confirmation of dates.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. This matter concerns Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nThe exchange of scheduling emails began with Katie Nelson, an associate at Richardson Law Group, sending to Sarena Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm on August 14, 2024. In that message, Katie followed up on Maeve’s earlier email regarding scheduling depositions and asked Sarena to provide a few dates in mid to late September when their clients would be available for deposition of both sides. Katie’s signature included her contact information and a standard environment notice, and the message carried Richardson Law Group’s confidentiality disclaimer as well as the typical email disclaimers about privileged information.\n\nOn August 19, 2024 at 11:36 AM, Sarena Tuttle replied that their calendar was pretty open for September and asked Katie to confirm which of the dates listed would work for both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions. She provided a list of available dates: September 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, and 26. Sarena’s email also included her contact information for the Whaley Law Firm and the standard external email caution, noting that the message was from an attorney at The Whaley Law Firm with the typical confidentiality and forwarding restrictions.\n\nA subsequent email from Katie on August 21, 2024 at 3:31 PM stated that her client would be available for the deposition on the afternoon of either September 17 or September 25. Katie indicated a preference to host the depositions at their office in Ft. Mitchell and proposed starting with Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 AM, with her client’s deposition to follow at 1:00 PM or shortly thereafter. Katie’s signature again included her office address at 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017, along with phone and fax numbers and her Richardson Law Group website. The email also carried the usual confidentiality notice and environmental reminder.\n\nSarena answered on August 21, 2024 at 3:36 PM, confirming that either of those September days would work for them and that they were happy to visit Katie’s office for the day. She noted that their clients are only about 15–20 minutes from Katie’s office and asked whether scheduling from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM would be enough time for two Plaintiff depositions, or if Katie preferred to depose only Greg. Sarena also attached her own signature block with The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details and an indication to watch for the new email address, along with the standard external email notice.\n\nLater on the same day, August 21, 2024 at 8:05 PM, Katie sent a follow-up reiterating and adjusting the plan. She proposed starting with Greg’s deposition at 10:00 AM and Cecilia’s deposition starting at noon, with her own client available for a 2:00–3:00 PM start time. Katie added that her client could be available for a 2–3 PM start time, and she reaffirmed the possibility of hosting the depositions at their Ft. Mitchell office. Her signature block again provided the Richardson Law Group contact details and the usual notices about confidentiality and environment.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, all emails included the standard notices typical of confidential attorney communications, including warnings against forwarding to unauthorized recipients, and several messages referenced external email cautions. The correspondents repeatedly discussed scheduling two plaintiff depositions in September, with the ongoing consideration of whether the depositions could be conducted in a single day at Katie’s Ft. Mitchell office or whether only Greg’s deposition should be taken on a given day, and they settled on tentative windows that would accommodate both Greg Neltner and the co-plaintiff (Cecilia) as needed.\n\nIn summary, the parties were coordinating depositions in the Neltner v. Cohara matter, with proposed September dates including the 17th and 25th, and a plan to conduct at least Greg Neltner’s deposition at 10:00 AM and Cecilia’s at noon, followed by another session (2:00–3:00 PM) if needed. The depositions were to be hosted at the Richardson Law Group office in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, with both sides’ counsel confirming travel proximity (15–20 minutes apart) and capacity to complete the depositions within the day’s schedule.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. This matter concerns Neltner v. Cohara, with planning communications among the parties’ counsel in August 2024 regarding depositions.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue began with Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group sending an inquiry on August 14, 2024, asking Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal at The Whaley Law Firm, to provide a few mid- to late-September dates when the clients would be available for their depositions. Katie’s message requested dates in that window so depositions could be arranged.\n\nOn August 19, 2024, Sarena replied that their calendar was fairly open for September and provided a list of potential dates for depositions: September 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, and 26. She asked which of those dates would work for both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions. Sarena signed with her Whaley Law Firm contact information, noting her new email address.\n\nThe discussion continued on August 21, 2024, when Katie proposed a plan for depositions on the afternoon of either September 17 or September 25. She stated that they were open to hosting the depositions at their office in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky, and that they would begin with Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 AM, with her client’s deposition to follow at 1:00 PM or shortly thereafter.\n\nLater that same day, at 3:36 PM, Sarena responded that either of those September days would work for them and that they were happy to visit Richardson Law Group’s office for the day, noting that their clients were about 15–20 minutes from the other office. She asked whether a window of 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM would be sufficient to conduct two Plaintiff depositions or if Richardson preferred to depose only Greg.\n\nAt 4:06 PM, August 21, Katie replied, proposing to begin with Greg’s deposition at 10:00 AM and to have Cecilia’s deposition start at noon. She added that her client could be available for a 2:00–3:00 PM start time if needed. Her message also included her standard contact details and a note about environmental considerations for printing.\n\nFinally, on August 22, 2024, at 10:10 AM, Sarena wrote back: “Awesome. I will notice Mrs. Cohara at 2:00 PM. Hopefully, that will give you all some time for a short break or lunch if you finish earlier.” She again included her contact information and noted the new email address.\n\nIn summary, the parties discussed scheduling two plaintiff depositions—likely Greg Neltner and Cecilia—on mid- to late September, with a plan to host the depositions at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office. The proposed structure was to start with Greg at 10:00 AM, Cecilia at noon, and to consider a potential 2:00–3:00 PM start for the defendant’s deposition if needed. The final confirmed note indicates a 2:00 PM deposition for Mrs. Cohara, with accommodations for breaks if the day runs long.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, emailed Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group on August 23, 2024, to clarify which deposition date had been agreed upon, noting that she had begun drafting a notice but did not see a final date. Her message also listed her contact information and new email address, and she copied Maeve Weihl, Josh Leckrone, Bryce Koon, and agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nThe surrounding email thread shows the deposition planning spanning several days in August 2024. In an earlier exchange, Katie Nelson replied, “Sounds good. Thanks Sarena.” The thread contains additional correspondence with standard firm email signatures and notices, including the Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office details and the Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville address. In one Aug. 22 message, Sarena replied, “Awesome. I will notice Mrs. Cohara at 2pm. Hopefully, that will give you all some time for a short break or lunch if you finish earlier.” Katie’s messages in the same period indicated initial scheduling thoughts for depositions and reaffirmed the plan to host the depositions at the Richardson Law Group office in Ft. Mitchell, with times to accommodate both sides.\n\nPrior planning dates appear in the August 19, 2024 message from Sarena. She stated that their calendar was fairly open for September and asked Katie to confirm which of the following dates would be available for both the Plaintiff and Defendant depositions: September 3, 4, 11, 12, 17, 24, 25, and 26. Earlier on August 21, Katie had proposed that the plaintiff’s deposition occur in the afternoon of either September 17 or September 25, with the firm offering to host the depositions at their Ft. Mitchell office, starting with the Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 a.m. and the defendant’s deposition to follow at 1:00 p.m or shortly thereafter. In another Aug. 21 message, Katie suggested starting with Greg’s deposition at 10:00 a.m. and planning Cecilia’s deposition to begin at noon, with her client available for a 2:00–3:00 p.m. start time.\n\nThe practical scheduling details in the chain reflect that the depositions were intended to be held at timelines centered on 10:00 a.m. for the plaintiff, noon for another deposition (referred to as Cecilia), and 1:00 p.m. or shortly thereafter for the client’s deposition, with a 2:00–3:00 p.m. window available on the defendant’s side. The notes show ongoing coordination among the attorneys and staff at The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group, including the exchange of potential dates (Sept 17 or Sept 25 among others) and a plan to assign specific times and witnesses, with Mrs. Cohara slated to be noticed for a 2:00 p.m. deposition on the chosen date.\n\nKey party and contact details included in the note chain are as follows: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971, main office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104, and the paralegal’s email as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new address). The Richardson Law Group is located at 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017, with a main phone number of (859) 444-4949, a fax of (859) 219-9292, and Katie Nelson’s contact email KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com. The emails also show that Sarena’s communications were circulated to Maeve Weihl, Josh Leckrone, Bryce Koon, and agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, with notices reiterating confidentiality and appropriate handling of the transmission.",

      "natural_language": "In the Neltner v. Cohara matter (Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023), the Richardson Law Group and The Whaley Law Firm exchanged emails in August 2024 to schedule a series of depositions related to Greg Neltner’s case. The attorneys discussed holding the depositions at Richardson’s Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky office, and considered dates of September 17 or September 25, 2024, with the plan to begin with plaintiff depositions at 10:00 a.m. and have additional depositions follow in the afternoon. Katie Nelson, an associate at Richardson, indicated that her client could be available for a deposition start time in the 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. window.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue evolved over several messages. On August 21, Katie proposed starting with Greg’s deposition at 10:00 a.m. and Cecilia’s deposition at noon, with “my client” available for a 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. start time, and she reiterated that the depositions could be hosted at their Ft. Mitchell office, with the plaintiff depositions beginning at 10:00 a.m. and her client’s deposition to follow at 1:00 p.m. or shortly thereafter. Earlier that same day, Sarena Tuttle from The Whaley Law Firm asked whether a 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. window would accommodate two plaintiff depositions or only Greg’s. Later that day, Katie refined the plan to start with Greg at 10:00 a.m., Cecilia at noon, and the client’s deposition beginning at 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. around the same date range of September 17 or September 25.\n\nOn August 22, the Whaley firm advised that they would notice Mrs. Cohara for a deposition at 2:00 p.m., with Katie replying that this was acceptable and that it might allow for a short break or lunch if schedules finished earlier. The exchange continued with the acknowledgment, “Sounds good,” from Katie. By August 23, there was still a request for finalizing the date, with Sarena asking whether the chosen date was September 17 or September 25, since she was preparing the notice. Katie answered later that day, definitively selecting September 17 as the date. In sum, the depositions were scheduled to occur on September 17, 2024, with Greg at 10:00 a.m., Cecilia at noon, and the remaining deposition(s) (including the client’s) to follow in the afternoon, and a deposition for Mrs. Cohara at 2:00 p.m., all to take place at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office. Participants in the email thread included Katie Nelson (Richardson Law Group), Sarena Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), Maeve Weihl, Josh Leckrone, Bryce Koon, and agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, with contact details listed in the correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. On August 23, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group with CC to Maeve Weihl, Josh Leckrone, Bryce Koon, and agwhaley, stating that their notice was attached.\n\nThe email chain begins with Katie Nelson’s message from August 23, 2024 at 9:50 a.m. In that message, she proposed September 17 as the deposition date, and she signed as an associate with her contact information and office location in Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky. The message also included the standard environmental reminder and a confidential, privileged notice applicable to the transmission.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Sarena Tuttle had replied on August 23, 2024 at 9:42 a.m., asking Katie to confirm which date had been decided—whether the 17th or the 25th—as she did not see a final date in the draft notice.\n\nThe preceding messages reveal the plan developing over August 22–23. On August 22, 2024 at 10:42 a.m., Katie Nelson replied, agreeing with the plan. At 10:10 a.m. that same day, Sarena sent a message stating, “Awesome. I will notice Mrs. Cohara at 2 pm,” indicating the intended time for Mrs. Cohara’s deposition and implying that the other deposition times would be arranged accordingly. Katie responded shortly after at 10:42 a.m. with “Sounds good. Thanks Sarena.”\n\nThe conversation that preceded these confirmations began on August 21, 2024. At 3:31 p.m., Katie wrote to Sarena indicating that the client was available for a deposition in the afternoon of either September 17 or September 25, and that Richardson Law Group was open to hosting the depositions at their Ft. Mitchell office, starting with Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 a.m., with the understanding that her client could be available for a 2–3 p.m. start time. Sarena replied at 3:36 p.m. stating that either date worked for them and that they were willing to visit the Richardson office for the day; she noted that their clients lived only 15–20 minutes from the office and asked whether 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. would be sufficient time for two plaintiff depositions or if only Greg’s deposition should be taken.\n\nOn the same day, August 21, at 4:06 p.m., Katie responded, proposing to begin with Greg’s deposition at 10:00 a.m. and to have Cecilia’s deposition begin at noon, with her client available for a 2–3 p.m. start time.\n\nThe thread also contains the usual external email caution notices and signatures from both sides, including contact details and the reminder to consider the environment before printing.\n\nIn summary, the case involves the Greg Neltner deposition in Neltner v. Cohara, with planning to host depositions at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office. The involved dates considered were September 17 or September 25, with plans to start Plaintiff depositions at 10:00 a.m. and to schedule Greg’s deposition at 10:00 a.m. and Cecilia’s at noon, while a 2–3 p.m. start time was contemplated for the client. By August 23, 2024, a final date of September 17 was proposed by Katie, and a formal notice was to be attached to the email. The notice attachment was sent later in the day, and the correspondence included a standard confidentiality and privilege notice. The parties and their counsel remained in agreement on hosting arrangements and deposition timing, with ongoing confirmation of the final date.",

The subject line referenced Neltner v. Cohara. In the body of the message, Tuttle stated that the demand package is in progress but noted that a message had been left yesterday requesting the name of the court reporter used during the Plaintiff Depositions. She indicated that the transcripts have not yet been received and that Whaley Law Firm would like to review and possibly reference those transcripts in the Demand. Tuttle asked Nelson to forward the court reporter’s contact information, so that Bryce Koon could reach out with an ETA on the Demand. Tuttle signed the email as a Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, providing the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (D) 502-357-9971; office line (O) 502-583-4022 ext. 104; and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note acknowledging the address as the new email address.\n\nKatie Nelson, Associate at Richardson Law Group, replied to the thread later that same day. In her message, dated November 6, 2024 (around 12:14 p.m.), Nelson addressed Aaron and stated that after the plaintiffs’ depositions in September, there had been a discussion that a demand package would be sent, but it had not yet been received. Nelson requested an update on the status of the demand package and asked to be informed if any additional information was needed from their side to facilitate the process. The message concluded with Nelson’s signature, listing her as an Associate at Richardson Law Group, located at 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft.

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. This matter involves Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nOn November 6, 2024, at 17:45:40 UTC, Katie Nelson, an Associate at Richardson Law Group, sent an email regarding Neltner v. Cohara. The message was addressed to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with copies to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Josh Leckrone, and Bryce Koon. In the body of the email, Nelson noted that Kentuckiana Court Reporters had been used and provided their contact information: 877-808-5856. Nelson signed with her firm’s details: Katie Nelson | Associate, Richardson Law Group, 334 Beechwood Road Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017; phone (859) 444-4949; fax (859) 219-9292; email KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com; website www.RichardsonLawGrp.com. The email contained Richardson Law Group’s standard confidentiality and privilege notice and environment notice, stating the transmission is for the named recipient and should not be copied or forwarded to unauthorized persons; if received in error, the recipient should delete it and notify the sender, and contact information for Richardson Law Group was provided for correcting the address record.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm responded later that day, on November 6, 2024, with an email from Sarena M. Tuttle. The message, sent at 12:17 PM, noted that their demand package was in progress. Tuttle stated that a message had been left the previous day requesting the name of the court reporter used during the Plaintiff Depositions. She informed that they had not yet received the transcripts and wished to review and possibly reference those transcripts in the Demand. Tuttle asked Nelson to forward the court reporter’s contact information, and she indicated that Bryce would reach out with an ETA on the Demand. Tuttle’s signature block identified her as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct line was (502) 357-9971, her office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104, and her email address was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating this was a new email address. The Whaley Law Firm’s message also carried an external email caution banner.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 12:14 PM (as indicated by the thread), Katie Nelson replied to Aaron regarding the same subject. Nelson wrote: “Aaron, Following Plaintiffs’ depositions in September, we discussed that you would be sending us a demand package. However, we have not yet received it. Could you please provide an update on the status of the demand package? Let us know if you need any further information from our side to facilitate this.” Nelson again signed with her Richardson Law Group contact details and the same confidentiality and environment notices as in her initial email.\n\nIn summary, communications between Richardson Law Group and The Whaley Law Firm on November 6, 2024, centered on the status and delivery of a demand package in Neltner v. Cohara, with requests for the name and contact information of the court reporter used during Plaintiff Depositions and for the associated transcripts, which had not yet been received. The parties also coordinated with Bryce Koon, Bryce’s involvement to obtain an ETA on the Demand, and the emails included standard confidentiality statements and the Kentuckiana Court Reporters contact information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nIn the matter of Neltner v. Cohara, communications on November 6, 2024, between the Whaley Law Firm and the Richardson Law Group illustrate ongoing efforts related to the demand package following the plaintiff depositions. The initial message in the thread appears from Katie Nelson, Associate at Richardson Law Group, addressed to Aaron (as referenced in the thread), with copies to the Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena Tuttle and others. Nelson stated that, after the plaintiffs’ depositions in September, the parties had discussed that a demand package would be sent, but to date she had not yet received it. She requested an update on the status of the demand package and asked if any further information was needed from their side to facilitate the process.\n\nSarena Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Nelson later that same day. At approximately 12:17 PM, Tuttle wrote that their demand package was in progress. She noted that they had left a message the previous day requesting the name of the court reporter used during the plaintiff depositions. She stated that they had not yet received the transcripts and would like to review and possibly reference those transcripts in the Demand. She asked Nelson to forward the court reporter’s contact information, and she indicated that Bryce Koon would reach out with an ETA on the Demand. Tuttle’s message included her contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note that this is the new email address.\n\nIn a follow-up message on the same day, approximately a few minutes later, Nelson replied, informing that Kentuckiana Court Reporters had been used. She provided their contact information: 877-808-5856. This information was given to facilitate obtaining the court reporter details for reference in the Demand package.\n\nLater that afternoon, at about 1:14 PM, Tuttle responded with a brief acknowledgment: “Awesome. Thank you so much.” This closed the immediate exchange regarding the court reporter and the status of transcripts and the demand package for the Neltner v. Cohara matter, at least in this sequence of emails.\n\nFor context, the email thread shows that the first message in the chain originated from Katie Nelson and was sent to Sarena Tuttle, with additional CCs to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Josh Leckrone, and Bryce Koon. The subject line across the thread is “Re: Neltner v. Cohara.” The exchanges reflect coordination on obtaining court reporter information, transcripts, and ETA for the demand package, all within the framework of the Greg Neltner case concerning the MVA involving Neltner and Cohara.",

Sarena replied later that same day, stating, “Yes, please proceed,” and included her contact details with the new email address noted. The Transcript Manager responded at 1:44 PM that they would inform the reporter to get the transcripts in the works, and the message included the Kentuckiana Reporters Transcript Department signature, along with contact information: P: 502-589-2273; E: transcripts@kentuckianareporters.com; A: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202; and the staff names, including Courtney Wiggins Madison Cyrus.\n\nThe initial chain also shows the earlier 1:31 PM message from the Transcript Manager, stating that, per the reporter, neither side had ordered transcripts at the time of the depositions. They could handle the order, but the first ordering party would be responsible for the cost of the original; they requested confirmation on whether to move forward.\n\nFinally, on November 13, 2024 at 11:04:16 AM Eastern, Sarena Tuttle sent another message to the Transcript Manager asking for an ETA on the upload of these transcripts, noting that the attorney requested an update. Her message, sent from The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, listed her direct line (D: 502-357-9971), office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and her new email address (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com). The message also carried the CC to Production at Kentuckiana Reporters and referenced the same case details: Plaintiff Depositions 09.17.2024 for Greg and Cecelia Nelter in Boone Circuit Court, 24-CI-00452 (103602).

      "natural_language": "In the Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023 matter, the deposition transcripts for the plaintiffs Greg Neltner and Cecelia Nelter were taken on September 17, 2024 in Boone Circuit Court, in case number 24-CI-00452 (103602). The matter appears to involve the motor vehicle accident that occurred on 04-01-2023. The transcripts were the subject of a communications chain between Kentuckiana Reporters and The Whaley Law Firm regarding ordering and delivery.\n\nOn November 6, 2024, the Transcript Manager informed Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, that neither side had ordered the transcripts at the time of the depositions. The Transcript Manager noted that Kentuckiana could proceed with producing the transcripts, but because The Whaley Law Firm would be the first ordering party, they would be responsible for the cost of the original transcripts. The message asked whether The Whaley Law Firm wished to move forward.\n\nSarena Tuttle replied on November 6, 2024 at 1:41 PM, confirming, “Yes, please proceed.” She indicated that she was requesting the transcripts and noted her new email address. In a follow-up reply at 1:44 PM the Transcript Manager reaffirmed that, per the reporter, neither side had ordered the transcripts at the time of the depositions and that the firm could get them in the works; again, the first ordering party would be responsible for the cost of the original, and they asked for confirmation to proceed.\n\nOn November 13, 2024 at 11:04 AM, Sarena asked for an ETA on the upload of the transcripts and provided contact details for follow-up: The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct lines and the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. Later that day, at 4:09 PM (UTC), Kentuckiana Reporters responded that the transcripts would go out on November 15, 2024, stating this was in line with their standard seven-business-day turnaround. The message included Kentuckiana’s contact information and address: 730 West Main Street, Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40202.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Neltner v. Cohara, a motor vehicle accident case identified as Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023, the client is Greg Neltner. On January 28, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, sent an email to Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group (with several colleagues CC’d) stating that, after reviewing the claim, the deposition of Mrs. Cohara needed to be rescheduled. She requested dates on which Mrs. Cohara would be available to complete the deposition and move the claim forward. The message was signed with Sarena’s full contact details: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting it as her new email address.\n\nThe email thread includes a prior exchange from November 6, 2024. At 12:14 PM that day, Katie Nelson wrote to Aaron (of the opposing side), noting that, following the plaintiffs’ depositions in September, there had been an agreement that Aaron would send a demand package, but none had been received yet. Katie asked for an update on the status of the demand package and whether any additional information was needed to facilitate its delivery. Katie’s signature block identified her as an Associate at Richardson Law Group, with the firm’s Ft. Mitchell, Kentucky office address and contact information.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:46 PM, Katie sent another message stating that they had used Kentuckiana Court Reporters and provided their contact information: 877-808-5856. Katie’s signature block was included again with the same firm details. Across the thread, the images and boilerplate notices typical of email signatures appeared in the record.\n\nAt 12:17 PM, Sarena replied to Katie, explaining that the demand package was in progress. She noted that they had left a message the previous day requesting the name of the court reporter used during the plaintiff depositions and that they had not yet received the transcripts. Sarena requested the court reporter’s contact information and stated that Bryce Koon would reach out with an ETA on the demand. Her message included her standard signature and contact details, highlighting the new email address.\n\nA follow-up reply from Sarena came at approximately 1:14 PM, simply thanking Katie with, “Awesome. Thank you so much.” This was also accompanied by Sarena’s full signature block.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects two primary threads: (1) a January 28, 2025 request from the Whaley Law Firm to reschedule Mrs. Cohara’s deposition and obtain dates of availability, and (2) a November 6, 2024 exchange concerning the status of the plaintiffs’ demand package, the court reporter used for the plaintiff depositions, and the receipt (or lack) of transcripts, with Kentuckiana Court Reporters named as the reporter service and contact details provided.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. The following notes summarize a sequence of email communications among counsel and staff concerning deposition scheduling and related demand package for the Neltner v. Cohara matter.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, at 10:29 a.m., Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Katie Nelson regarding the Neltner v. Cohara matter. In the message, which was also copied to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Josh Leckrone, and Bryce Koon, Sarena stated that, upon review of the claim, it appears the deposition of Mrs. Cohara needs to be rescheduled and asked that counsel provide dates on which Mrs. Cohara will be available to complete the deposition and move the claim forward. The email included Sarena’s contact information and noted her new email address. The subject line of the message was Re: Neltner v. Cohara, and the email carried the external email caution notice common to messages from outside the recipient’s organization.\n\nLater that same day, at 3:36:27 p.m. +0000, Katie Nelson—an Associate at Richardson Law Group, located at 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017 (phone 859-444-4949, fax 859-219-9292, KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com), with signature blocks and confidentiality notices in her correspondence—responded to Sarena. In her reply, Katie explained that they were awaiting a response from Mrs. Cohara regarding her availability and that she would send Sarena a list of dates that work for Mrs. Cohara as soon as they heard back. The message was addressed to Sarena and was CC’d to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Josh Leckrone, and Bryce Koon. It also included the standard confidential/privilege notice typical of Richardson Law Group emails.\n\nThis series of January 28, 2025, communications followed a previously ongoing thread from November 2024. On November 6, 2024, at 12:14 p.m., Katie Nelson sent an email to Aaron (the recipient referenced in the chain) regarding the demand package for the plaintiffs’ depositions in September, noting that the package had not yet been received and asking for an update on the status or any information needed to facilitate its delivery. Katie’s message carried her standard signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 12:17 p.m. on November 6, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied to Katie, indicating that the demand package was in progress but that they had left a message the previous day requesting the name of the court reporter used during the Plaintiff Depositions. Sarena stated that they had not yet received the transcripts and would like to review and possibly reference those transcripts in the Demand, requesting that Katie forward the court reporter’s contact information so that Bryce could be reached with an ETA on the Demand. This message was also marked as external email and included Sarena’s signature and new email address.\n\nIn a subsequent November 6, 2024 reply, at 12:46 p.m., Katie Nelson informed Aaron that Kentuckiana Court Reporters had been used and provided their contact information: 877-808-5856. Katie’s message included her usual signature and confidentiality notice.\n\nLater still on November 6, 2024, at 1:14 p.m., Sarena Tuttle responded with, “Awesome. Thank you so much,” in acknowledgment of the information about the court reporter. This exchange also carried the external email caution and the standard Whaley Law Firm signature block.\n\nIn the same November 6, 2024 thread, the message from Katie Nelson preceding these steps reiterated her request for the status of the demand package following the plaintiffs’ depositions in September, noting that they had discussed that a demand package would be sent but had not yet been received and asking for any needed information to facilitate delivery.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondents repeatedly attached their standard email footers, including confidentiality notices, and identified the relevant personnel, offices, and contact details. The core factual elements preserved in this narrative are the ongoing need to reschedule Mrs. Cohara’s deposition, the request for dates of availability to complete the deposition, the status and pursuit of a demand package from the plaintiffs’ side, and the identification of court reporter contact information (Kentuckiana Court Reporters, 877-808-5856) as part of those discussions.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. This summary covers the email communications between Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with others copied, concerning deposition scheduling for Mrs. Cohara in the Neltner v. Cohara matter.\n\nIn November 2024, the parties began coordinating deposition logistics. On November 6, 2024 at 12:46 PM, Katie Nelson wrote that they had used Kentuckiana Court Reporters for prior depositions and provided their contact information: 877-808-5856. Earlier that same day, at 12:29 PM, Sarena Tuttle sent a message stating that the demand package was in progress but that they had left a message requesting the name of the court reporter used during the Plaintiff Depositions and that, to date, they had not received the transcripts. Sarena asked Katie Nelson to forward the court reporter’s contact information so Bryce could follow up with an ETA on the Demand. In reply, at 12:14 PM, Katie Nelson told Aaron (the message began with “Aaron, Following Plaintiffs’ depositions in September…”) that, after the Plaintiffs’ depositions in September, they had discussed that a demand package would be sent, but they had not yet received it, and she requested an update on the status of the demand package and asked if any additional information was needed to facilitate it. Later that day, at 12:17 PM, Sarena responded that the demand package was in progress and that they had left a message the previous day requesting the name of the court reporter used for the Plaintiff Depositions and the transcripts, which they had not yet received; Bryce would be contacted with an ETA on the Demand. At 1:14 PM, Sarena then acknowledged Katie’s note with a brief reply: “Awesome. Thank you so much.” Katie’s earlier message, and the subsequent exchange, indicate that the team was coordinating both the demand package and the court reporter details, and Sarena confirmed the court reporter information the same day.\n\nThe thread shows an ongoing effort to obtain the court reporter’s name and transcripts for reference in the Demand, and to confirm the appropriate reporter for the depositions, as well as trying to move forward with the demand package.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, the scheduling process for Mrs. Cohara’s deposition continued. At 10:29 AM, Sarena wrote, Good morning Counsel, noting that upon review of the claim it appeared the deposition of Mrs. Cohara needed to be rescheduled, and requesting that the office be provided with dates when Mrs. Cohara would be available to complete the deposition and move the claim forward. In response, at 10:36 AM, Katie Nelson replied that they were awaiting a response from Mrs. Cohara regarding her availability and would send a list of dates that work for her as soon as they heard back.\n\nFinally, on January 31, 2025, Katie Nelson sent an update indicating that Ms. Cohara was available for her deposition on March 7, any time after 1:00 PM. She suggested holding the deposition at Richardson Law Group’s office in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, the same location used for the Plaintiffs’ deposition, and asked colleagues to confirm whether this date would work. Sarena Tuttle acknowledged the update with a brief response: “Thank you for letting me know. We look forward to hearing from you soon.”\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the emails included standard confidentiality and environment notices, and in the January 28, 2025 correspondence, Sarena’s signature reflected a new email address for contact. The signatures show the parties’ contact details: Katie Nelson is with Richardson Law Group, located at 334 Beechwood Road Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017, with phone (859) 444-4949 and fax (859) 219-9292, and email KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com; Sarena Tuttle is with The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone (502) 357-9971 and (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The messages repeatedly note the confidentiality and privileged nature of the communications, and one message directs recipients to consider the environment before printing.",

      "natural_language": "In the Greg Neltner v. Cohara case, with Greg Neltner as the client, the parties’ counsel began a series of scheduling discussions in late 2024 and early 2025 about deposing Mrs. Cohara. The exchanges involved The Whaley Law Firm, represented by W. Bryce Koon, and Richardson Law Group, represented by Katie Nelson, with numerous copies sent to Sarena Tuttle and Josh Leckrone, and included other recipients from both firms. The matter’s routine notice and confidentiality language accompanied each email.\n\nOn November 6, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm notified Katie Nelson that, after reviewing the claim, the deposition of Mrs. Cohara needed to be rescheduled and requested dates when Mrs. Cohara would be available to proceed. Katie replied that they had been using Kentuckiana Court Reporters and provided their contact information, indicating that the deposition logistics could be coordinated through that service. Later that same day, Sarena responded with a brief note of appreciation: “Awesome. Thank you so much.” The exchanges on this date also included the parties’ standard attorney-client privilege notices.\n\nMoving forward to January 2025, the parties continued the scheduling dialogue. On January 28, Katie informed Sarena that they were awaiting a response from Mrs. Cohara regarding her availability, and she would send a list of dates that would work as soon as they heard back. Earlier that morning, at 10:29 AM, Sarena had written: “Good morning Counsel, Upon review of this claim, it appears we need to reschedule the deposition of Mrs. Cohara. Please provide our office with dates that Mrs. Cohara will be available to complete the deposition and move this claim forward.” Katie replied at 10:36 AM that they were awaiting Mrs. Cohara’s availability and would send dates when they heard back. At 10:38 AM, Sarena thanked Katie and said they looked forward to hearing from them soon.\n\nThe next milestone came on January 31, 2025. Katie sent a message stating that Mrs. Cohara would be available for deposition on March 7, any time after 1:00 PM, and she recommended holding the deposition at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office, as had been done for the Plaintiffs. Bryce Koon replied later that day, indicating he would be out of town on that date and asking whether any other March dates might work.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the emails carried the customary confidentiality notices and environment-friendly prints, as well as the contact details for the involved parties. The Whaley Law Firm was identified as located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with Bryce Koon’s direct line listed as (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. Richardson Law Group’s offices were described as located at 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017, with Katie Nelson’s phone number listed as (859) 444-4949 and a fax number of (859) 219-9292. The communications reflect the ongoing effort to schedule Mrs. Cohara’s deposition in a manner that would move the Neltner v. Cohara claim forward, while accommodating the availability of the involved parties.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. This matter concerns the deposition scheduling for Neltner v. Cohara, and the communications document scheduling the deposition of Mrs. Cohara.\n\nThe first dated exchange in the trail is from November 6, 2024, when Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group noted that they had used Kentuckiana Court Reporters and provided their contact information (Kentuckiana Court Reporters: 877-808-5856). The message also included standard signature blocks with Nelson’s office address (334 Beechwood Road Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017), phone, fax, email, and website, along with a notice about environmental printing and a privilege disclaimer.\n\nOn January 28, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Katie Nelson asking to reschedule the deposition after reviewing the claim. She requested that Richardson Law Group provide dates on which Mrs. Cohara would be available to complete the deposition and move the claim forward. Nelson replied later that day that they were awaiting a response from Mrs. Cohara regarding her availability and that she would send a list of dates that worked as soon as they heard back. Nelson’s email also carried the same signature blocks and notices as before.\n\nThat same morning, January 28, 2025, at 10:36 a.m., Nelson followed up to Sarena, confirming they were waiting on Mrs. Cohara’s availability and promising to provide dates once they heard back. Sarena responded at 10:38 a.m. with thanks and noted they looked forward to hearing from Nelson soon.\n\nThe following day, January 31, 2025, Katie Nelson wrote to all involved: Mrs. Cohara was available for deposition on March 7, any time after 1:00 p.m., and Nelson recommended holding the deposition at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office, as they had done for the Plaintiffs. Nelson asked to confirm whether the proposed date would work. Her message included the same standard signature and notices.\n\nLater that day, January 31, 2025, at 1:04 p.m., Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm responded that he would be out of town on that date and asked whether there were other March dates that might work.\n\nThe next communication in the thread occurs on February 12, 2025, at 6:09 p.m. Katie Nelson sent a message to Bryce Koon asking about March 14 or March 21 as alternatives. The email continued with the same signature blocks and notices, and it was cc’d to Sarena Tuttle, agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com, Josh Leckrone, and others.\n\nThroughout the thread, the emails include the customary notices about privilege and confidentiality, environment notices regarding printing, and standard forwarding restrictions. The signatories’ signature blocks consistently list contact information for Katie Nelson (Richardson Law Group) and Bryce Koon (The Whaley Law Firm), including addresses and phone numbers, along with email addresses and website URLs. References to the deposition location, scheduling preferences, and dates are confined to the dates and content described above.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023; Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nIn late January 2025, the deposition schedule for Mrs. Cohara in the Neltner v. Cohara matter was being coordinated between counsel for Greg Neltner and counsel for Mrs. Cohara. On January 28, 2025 at 10:29 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, advised Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group that, after reviewing the claim, it appeared the deposition of Mrs. Cohara needed to be rescheduled and asked for dates on which Mrs. Cohara would be available to move the case forward. Sarena provided The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address).\n\nLater that same day, January 28, 2025, at 10:36 AM, Katie Nelson replied that they were awaiting a response from Mrs. Cohara regarding her availability and that she would send a list of workable dates as soon as they heard back.\n\nSarena responded again on January 28, 2025 at 10:38 AM, thanking Katie and saying they looked forward to hearing from her soon. Sarena’s signature reiterated her role and The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information.\n\nOn January 31, 2025 at 12:47 PM, Katie Nelson wrote that Mrs. Cohara was available for a deposition on March 7, any time after 1:00 PM, and she suggested holding the deposition at Richardson Law Group’s office in Ft. Mitchell, KY, as they did for the Plaintiffs. She requested confirmation if this date would work.\n\nBryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm responded on January 31, 2025 at 1:04 PM that he would be out of town on that date and asked if any other dates in March might work.\n\nBy February 12, 2025, Katie Nelson again sought availability for March dates, asking whether March 14 or March 21 could work for Mrs. Cohara.\n\nLater that day, February 12, 2025, at 1:32 PM, Sarena Tuttle replied noting Bryce’s availability on March 21, 2025 and indicating that their office would be fine, but requesting an 11:30 a.m. start to accommodate travel to Ft. Mitchell.\n\nSummary of key points:\n- The deposition of Mrs. Cohara in Neltner v. Cohara was initially proposed for March 7 after 1:00 PM, to be held at Richardson Law Group’s Ft. Mitchell office (address listed in signatures: 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017).\n- Bryce Koon could not make March 7 due to being out of town, so alternative March dates were requested.\n- March 21, 2025 was identified as an available date for Bryce, with a preferred start time of 11:30 AM to allow travel to Ft. Mitchell.\n- March 14 was also proposed as a potential date to consider.\n\nIf you need, I can format this into a concise chronology with exact timestamps or convert it into a more formal narrative memo.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nIn the Neltner v. Cohara matter, dated communications circulated in February 2025 regarding taking the deposition of Mrs. Cohara. On February 12, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, emailed Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm, with Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group and others copied, to transmit an Amended Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Cohara for March 21, 2025, beginning at 2:00 p.m. at the recipient’s office. Tuttle invited any questions or requests for further discussion and provided her contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address). The message also contained the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThe scheduling conversation began earlier in the year. On January 31, 2025, Bryce Koon replied to Katie Nelson with a plan to be out of town on that date and asked whether there were other possible dates in March that might work. In Katie Nelson’s prior message, dated January 31, 2025 at 12:47 p.m., she had proposed that Ms. Cohara be deposed on March 7, any time after 1:00 p.m., and she suggested holding the deposition at their Ft. Mitchell office, as had been done for the Plaintiffs, asking to know if this date would work.\n\nIn a sequence of exchanges on February 12, 2025, the topic focused on March 21 or other dates. Katie asked whether March 14 or 21 could work. Sarena replied that Bryce was available on March 21, 2025 and that their office would be suitable, but they requested an 11:30 a.m. start time to allow travel to Ft. Mitchell. Katie responded that her client was only available in the afternoon and asked whether a 1:30 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. start time would work for Bryce. Sarena said she would double-check with Bryce and get back to Katie as soon as possible. Bryce then confirmed that 2:00 p.m. on March 21, 2025 at Katie’s office would be fine, thanking Katie for coordinating.\n\nShortly after this back-and-forth, Sarena sent the Amended Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Cohara for March 21, 2025, beginning at 2:00 p.m., at the other side’s office, and indicated that if there were any questions or a need for further discussion, they should be contacted directly. The exchange included standard email notices and multiple copies to the involved attorneys, with the following participants and roles: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm; W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm; Katie Nelson, Associate at Richardson Law Group, PLLC; and Josh Leckrone of Richardson Law Group, among others CC’d on the correspondence.\n\nIn summary, after initial scheduling discussions for March 7, and then proposed alternatives of March 14 or March 21, the team settled on March 21, 2025, with a preferred 11:30 a.m. start initially noted by the Whaley team to allow travel time. However, after considerations of the afternoon availability of the deponent, the parties ultimately confirmed a deposition on March 21, 2025, beginning at 2:00 p.m., to be held at the recipient’s office, via the Amended Notice attached by Sarena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023, involving client Greg Neltner and Progressive Claim #23-6275504. The communication chain centers on negotiations following a motor vehicle accident in which Greg Neltner and Cecilia Neltner are the clients, and the opposing party is Ms. Cohara.\n\nOn February 27, 2025 at 02:07:24 PM (GMT-05:00), Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Megan Renfro of Progressive, with copies to two Filevine project email addresses. In the message, Bryce stated that, as discussed with Ms. Nelson, they were unable to negotiate the claim on the basis of split liability. His clients have testified consistently that Ms. Cohara bears responsibility for the collision. He noted that Ms. Cohara did not appear to testify at her previously scheduled deposition, and that the deposition has been rescheduled to 03/21/25. Bryce signed as *W. Bryce Koon, Esq.* of The Whaley Law Firm, with full contact details, and the message included The Whaley Law Firm’s address and phone/fax numbers. The electronic message also contained a standard attorney-client privilege/confidentiality notice instructing that it is intended only for the named recipient, and specifying that disclosure or forwarding is prohibited if received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, February 27, 2025 at approximately 2:03 PM, Megan E. Renfro replied to Bryce. She asked whether he had spoken with his clients, Gregory and Cecilia Neltner, and whether they had any responses to Progressive’s offers.\n\nThis exchange followed a series of prior communications. On January 21, 2025 at 3:08 PM, Megan Renfro sent Bryce a message confirming offers discussed during a conversation about the Neltner clients. The message stated: “Bryce, Thank you for speaking with me today regarding clients Gregory and Cecilia Neltner. Please allow this to confirm my offers of $1,500 for Gregory and $500 for Cecilia. Both offer are inclusive of any and all liens, exclusive of PIP and inclusive of your firm obtaining a dismissal. Please review these offers with your clients. I look forward to working with you.” The message was signed by Megan Renfro, Sr. Claims Specialist, The Progressive Group of Insurance Companies, and included Progressive’s mailing address, office hours, and contact information, along with a confidentiality disclaimer and a note to track the claim online.\n\nOn February 7, 2025 at 7:25 AM, Megan Renfro again emailed Bryce, following up to see if he had a chance to speak with his clients and whether they had a response to the offers. The message reiterated the same contact details and confidentiality language found in the later exchanges.\n\nIn summary, the record shows Progressive’s initial offers of $1,500 for Gregory Neltner and $500 for Cecilia Neltner (inclusive of all liens, exclusive of PIP, and including the firm obtaining a dismissal), with repeated requests for the Neltners to review and respond. Progressive sought confirmation of any response from the Neltner clients after Bryce’s discussions, while Bryce’s February 27 email documented that the defense maintains that Ms. Cohara bears responsibility for the collision and noted the rescheduling of Ms. Cohara’s deposition to 03/21/25 due to her failure to appear at the prior deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023 concerns the matter Neltner v. Cohara, with client Greg Neltner. The record shows a sequence of email communications about scheduling Ms. Cohara’s deposition. On January 31, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (address 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) wrote to Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group (address 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017; phone 859-444-4949; fax 859-219-9292) and to Josh Leckrone, cc’ing Sarena Tuttle of Whaley (with copy of agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com). In that message, Bryce explained he would be out of town on that date and asked whether there were other possible dates in March that would work for the deposition.\n\nEarlier in February 2025, Katie Nelson asked whether March 14 or March 21 could work for Bryce. On February 12, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, responded that Bryce is available on March 21, 2025 and that their office would be suitable, but she requested an 11:30 a.m. start to allow travel time to Ft. Mitchell. She also advised she would check with Bryce and get back with any updates. In response, Bryce stated that 2:00 p.m. on March 21, 2025 at the recipient’s office would be fine.\n\nEarlier that same day, Katie asked whether a 1:30 p.m. or 2:00 p.m. start would work for Bryce, noting that her client is only available in the afternoon. Katie’s message included her contact details and a standard email signature. In reply, Sarena reiterated that Bryce was available on March 21, 2025 and that their office was perfect, but again noted the 11:30 a.m. start to allow travel time to Ft. Mitchell. She provided her direct line and confirmed the new email address for correspondence (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com).\n\nSeparately, Sarena’s earlier exchange included an attachment: an amended notice to take the deposition of Mrs. Cohara for March 21, 2025 beginning at 2:00 p.m., to be held at the receiving party’s office. The communication chain also shows the following from prior messages: on January 31, 2025 Bryce had asked for alternative dates in March since he would be out of town on the initially proposed date; Katie had proposed March 14 or March 21; and Sarena had then confirmed the 21st with Bryce’s availability and the preferred times, including the travel considerations.\n\nOn February 12, 2025 at approximately 1:32–1:41 p.m., the parties continued to discuss the timing and location. Katie’s inbox contained the February 12 messages and the related “Re: Neltner v. Cohara” subject line, with the correspondence continuing to reflect the dynamic between meeting Bryce’s availability, the travel constraints to Ft. Mitchell, and the scheduling of the deposition.\n\nFinally, on March 20, 2025 at 9:38:04 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryce emailed to confirm the deposition for Ms. Cohara would proceed the following afternoon, asking for confirmation that all counsel were still good to go for the deposition the next day. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, and provided the firm’s Louisville address and contact information. The email carried The Whaley Law Firm’s standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer, indicating that the message was intended only for the named recipient and that any attachments or information should not be shared with unauthorized third parties.\n\nIn summary, the deposition for Ms. Cohara in the Neltner v. Cohara matter was scheduled for March 21, 2025, with a preferred start time around 11:30 a.m. to accommodate travel, but ultimately the approved arrangement included a proposed start time of 2:00 p.m. at the designated office, and a final confirmation request to ensure all counsel were prepared for the deposition the following afternoon. The participating counsel included The Whaley Law Firm (Bryce Koon and Sarena Tuttle) and Richardson Law Group (Katie Nelson and Josh Leckrone), with Amended Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Cohara dated February 12, 2025, and a series of confirming messages surrounding start times and office locations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nOver the course of scheduling discussions in late January through March 2025, counsel worked to arrange the deposition of Mrs. Cohara in the Neltner v. Cohara matter. On Friday, January 31, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Katie Nelson, Associate at Richardson Law Group, asking whether March 14 or March 21 would work for Ms. Cohara’s deposition and noting the need to finalize timing. Katie Nelson replied later that day, indicating they were coordinating time, with the sense that an afternoon start could be workable, and she asked whether a 1:30 or 2:00 pm start would suit her client since she stated her client was available only in the afternoon. The thread included standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nOn February 12, 2025, a series of messages continued the scheduling discussion. Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm (contact details: D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note: new email address), wrote to Bryce and Katie that they had attached an Amended Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Cohara for March 21, 2025 beginning at 2:00 p.m. at the recipient’s office. In a separate reply, Bryce Koon confirmed that 2:00 p.m. on March 21, 2025 would be fine. Earlier in the same thread, Sarena had indicated she would double check with her client to ensure the proposed time would work and get back to them promptly. Katie Nelson then noted that her client was available only in the afternoon and asked whether a 1:30 or 2:00 p.m. start would work for Bryce.\n\nPrior to these confirmations, there were discussions about travel and start times. In a message dated February 12, 2025 at 1:32 p.m., Sarena proposed that Bryce be available on March 21, 2025, supporting the date as suitable, but requesting an 11:30 a.m. start time to accommodate travel to Ft. Mitchell. Katie replied that her client was available only in the afternoon and again asked about 1:30 or 2:00 p.m. starts. A prior message from Katie dated February 12, 2025 at 1:10 p.m. asked about March 14 or 21, and a later message from Sarena indicated Bryce was available on March 21 and that their office would be suitable, though the 11:30 a.m. travel consideration remained.\n\nThe thread also contains an email from Sarena on February 12, 2025 at 2:45 p.m. stating that the Amended Notice to Take the Deposition of Mrs. Cohara for March 21, 2025 beginning at 2:00 p.m. at the other side’s office had been attached, inviting questions or requests for further discussion. The notes include the typical legal-communication disclosures, including external email cautions in several messages, and the standard notices that the communications are privileged and confidential.\n\nOn March 20, 2025, the day before the deposition, Katie Nelson followed up confirming the arrangement. She wrote that they were confirmed for Ms. Cohara’s deposition tomorrow afternoon. The message was sent to Bryce Koon and Josh Leckrone, with Sarena Tuttle copied, and included the signature blocks and the usual confidentiality notice. Katie provided her contact details: Associate at Richardson Law Group, 334 Beechwood Road, Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017; Phone 859-444-4949; Fax 859-219-9292; Email KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com; Website www.RichardsonLawGrp.com.\n\nBryce Koon’s earlier messages—sent from The Whaley Law Firm to Katie Nelson and Josh Leckrone, with Sarena Tuttle copied—also carried standard confidentiality notices. In those communications, Bryce confirmed that, subject to the discussions and the Amended Notice, they were prepared to proceed with the deposition on March 21, 2025, beginning at 2:00 p.m., at the indicated office.\n\nIn sum, the deposition of Mrs. Cohara in Neltner v. Cohara was scheduled and ultimately confirmed for March 21, 2025, in the afternoon, with the Amended Notice setting a 2:00 p.m. start and specifying the deposition location as the recipient’s office. The exchange involved Katie Nelson (Richardson Law Group), Bryce Koon and Josh Leckrone (The Whaley Law Firm—Bryce being the primary coordinating attorney), and Sarena M. Tuttle (The Whaley Law Firm), along with standard privilege notices and the “Please note NEW EMAIL ADDRESS” notices for Sarena. The scheduling also included discussion of an 11:30 a.m. start as a travel consideration, but the final arrangement moved toward a 2:00 p.m. start on March 21, 2025, with the depositions to occur in the afternoon, and the subject deposition confirmed the next day.",

In an email thread dated Friday, April 11, 2025, Katie Nelson, Associate at Richardson Law Group, wrote to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm regarding mediation in this matter. She stated that they would like to move forward with mediation and asked whether Koon was open to mediation and if he had a preferred mediator. If he did not have a preferred mediator, she recommended two possible mediators: Joe Mordino or Linda Hopgood.

He requested that Nelson provide some dates in the coming weeks so he can coordinate with his clients and schedule a mediation session.

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. The correspondence concerns mediation for the Neltner v. Cohara matter, with the mediation planning conducted between The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group.\n\nOn April 11, 2025, at 10:07 a.m., Katie Nelson of Richardson Law Group sent an email to Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm. She stated that they would like to move forward with mediation in this matter and asked whether Bryce was open to mediation, and if so, whether he had a preferred mediator. She noted that if Bryce did not have someone in mind, they would recommend either Joe Mordino or Linda Hopgood. The email included Katie’s standard signature and confidentiality notice, which explains that the message is for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, and provides instructions if the message was received in error.\n\nBryce Koon replied on May 6, 2025 at 12:22 p.m. He apologized for the delay in responding and indicated that he was good with either mediator suggested by Katie. He asked Katie to provide some dates in the coming weeks so he could coordinate with his clients and schedule the mediation. This reply also carried The Whaley Law Firm’s standard confidentiality and privilege notice.\n\nLater that same day, May 6, 2025 at 3:11 p.m., Katie Nelson sent another email. She attached lists of available dates and noted that the second week of July onward were fairly open for them. She asked Bryce to let her know which date works best so she could confirm with their claims professional. The message again included Katie’s contact information and the customary confidentiality notice.\n\nShortly after, at 3:18 p.m. on May 6, 2025, Bryce sent a final reply in this thread. He stated that the afternoon of Tuesday, July 8 should be great, and that he was good with either of the mediators identified by Katie. He requested that Katie provide dates in the coming weeks so he could coordinate with his clients and move forward with scheduling. This message also included Bryce’s standard contact details and a confidentiality disclaimer. The email was cc’d to Cecelia Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 and Greg Neltner MVA 4/1/2023, with their associated Filevine project email addresses.\n\nFor context, the parties’ communications reference mediation options and scheduling, with Katie proposing either Joe Mordino or Linda Hopgood as potential mediators if Bryce had no preference, and Bryce indicating openness to either mediator. The discussion centers on confirming dates, particularly with July as a target, and coordinating with the respective claims professionals. The emails repeatedly emphasize confidentiality and privilege and provide the standard notices found in such correspondence.\n\nSignatures and contact details appear at the end of the messages. Bryce Koon is listed as Esq. of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax of (502) 237-3207. Katie Nelson is listed as an Associate at Richardson Law Group, located at 334 Beechwood Road Suite 304, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017, with a phone number of (859) 444-4949, a fax of (859) 219-9292, and an email address of KNelson@RichardsonLawGrp.com. The notices at the bottom of each email reiterate environment-friendly printing reminders and remind recipients to maintain confidentiality.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara. The matter was the subject of an email chain concerning mediation in the Neltner v. Cohara case. The initial message on May 15, 2025, came from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, to Katie Nelson Dunn, Associate at Richardson Law Group, with several recipients cc’d: Cecelia Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 – Filevine Project Email Address, Greg Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 – Filevine Project Email Address, and Whitney Moore. The header notes the date and time as Thursday, May 15, 2025, at 10:54:09 a.m. GMT-04:00. In that message, Bryce commented that “No Zoom would be great,” and he closed with his signature block that provides his firm’s contact information and a standard attorney‑client privilege notice.\n\nEarlier that same day, Katie Nelson Dunn replied (at 10:48 a.m.). She informed Bryce that Linda Hopgood was available on July 8 at 1:00 p.m. via Zoom and asked whether there were any objections to conducting the mediation via Zoom. Her email included her own signature block with her title and contact details, as well as the Richardson Law Group notice about privilege and environment, and it carried the same confidentiality advisories as typical firm correspondence.\n\nThe thread traces back to April 11, 2025, when Katie had first proposed mediation for this matter. In that message she asked Bryce whether he was open to mediation and, if so, whether he had a preferred mediator. She noted that if he did not have someone in mind, they would recommend either Joe Mordino or Linda Hopgood.\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Bryce responded to Katie with the substance that the afternoon of Tuesday, July 8 should be “great,” and he indicated he was open to either of the mediators she had identified. He invited Katie to provide dates in the coming weeks so he could coordinate with his clients and schedule.\n\nEarlier that same day, Katie had sent a follow-up email with attached lists of available dates. She explained that the second week of July onward was fairly open for her side and asked Bryce to indicate which date would work best so she could confirm with their claims professional. Bryce acknowledged receipt of those lists and reiterated his openness to either mediator, asking for specific dates to proceed.\n\nA prior message from Bryce, sent at 12:22 p.m. on May 6, 2025, to Katie (with Cecelia Neltner and Greg Neltner copied) apologized for the delay in getting back and stated that he was comfortable with either of the mediators identified. He requested that Katie share dates in the coming weeks so that he could coordinate with his clients and schedule the mediation.\n\nThe chain also includes an April 11, 2025 email from Katie to Bryce, as noted above, in which she stated that the parties would like to move forward with mediation and proposed two mediator options if Bryce did not have a preferred mediator: Joe Mordino or Linda Hopgood.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects ongoing discussions among counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group about mediation in Neltner v. Cohara, with initial mediation recommendations, a schedule of available dates (notably the second week of July onward), and a shift in preference toward Zoom proceedings, specifically noting Linda Hopgood’s availability on July 8 at 1:00 p.m. via Zoom. The correspondence includes the standard attorney‑client privilege notices, disclaimers, and contact details for Bryce Koon, Katie Nelson Dunn, Cecelia Neltner, Greg Neltner, and Whitney Moore, as well as the Filevine project email addresses for the Neltner matters.",

      "natural_language": "The case at hand is Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023, concerning Greg Neltner in the matter Neltner v. Cohara. The notes summarize a sequence of email exchanges between counsel at The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group regarding scheduling for a deposition/mediation in the Neltner v. Cohara matter. The thread begins with a May 6, 2025 exchange and continues through May 15, 2025, with multiple proposed dates in July 2025 and differing preferences about whether the proceedings should be conducted by Zoom.\n\nIn the May 6, 2025 correspondence, Katie Nelson Dunn of Richardson Law Group (the recipient in the chain) sent Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm a list of available dates and noted that the second week of July onward was fairly open; she asked Bryce to indicate which date would work and that she would confirm with their claims professional. Bryce replied that the afternoon of Tuesday, July 8 would be great. He signed the message as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, and included his office address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, along with his phone and fax numbers. The email chain includes the standard attorney‑client privilege disclaimer and confidentiality notices, as well as an invitation to consider the environment before printing.\n\nOn May 15, 2025, further scheduling discussions occurred. Katie informed Bryce that Linda Hopgood’s office had advised that Linda would no longer be available on July 8, and she asked whether Bryce could do July 9, 10, or 17 for a Zoom deposition. In a reply from Bryce, he stated, “No Zoom would be great,” indicating a preference for proceeding without a Zoom format. The thread also contains the typical external-email warnings and confidentiality notices that accompany the correspondence, including the reminder that the message is intended only for the named recipients and should not be forwarded to unauthorized individuals.\n\nLater on May 15, 2025, Katie responded with an alternative: Linda Hopgood was available on July 8 at 1 PM via Zoom, and she asked whether there were any objections to conducting the mediation by Zoom. Bryce’s responses continued to appear in the thread, including another note reiterating his stance that no Zoom would be great, and the thread shows a back-and-forth about the preferred format and timing. The chain also contains the customary “notice” language about confidentiality and privilege, a reminder to avoid printing to protect the environment, and the general contact details for the participants.\n\nIn the header of the thread, the May 15, 2025 message from Bryce Koon includes the line “July 9 will work for me,” along with Bryce’s standard signature block. The correspondence was addressed to Katie Nelson Dunn of Richardson Law Group and included CCs to Cecelia Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 (Filevine project email CeceliaNeltnerMVAZ3723199@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), Greg Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 (Filevine project email GregNeltnerMVAZ3721957@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), and Whitney Moore (wmoore@richardsonlawgrp.com). The email chain also contains the various automated warnings about external emails and the multiple signature blocks and postal addresses for the two law firms involved.\n\nIn sum, the note captures Greg Neltner’s case’s scheduling dialogue over a two-week period in May 2025, detailing proposed July dates for a deposition or mediation, the evolving availability of Linda Hopgood, and the ongoing tension in the thread between a Zoom versus non‑Zoom format, all embedded within the standard confidentiality and privilege notices and the procedural courtesy typical of attorney communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. Client: Greg Neltner. Re: Neltner v. Cohara.\n\nIn an email dated May 15, 2025 at 11:42 AM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, addressed to Whitney Moore of Richardson Law Group and Katie Nelson Dunn, with copies to Cecelia Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 and Greg Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 via their Filevine project email addresses, confirmed the mediation date of July 8 at 1:00 PM. The message included Bryce’s firm contact information and a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier in the thread, at about 11:31 AM, Whitney Moore responded that Linda Hopgood’s office advised the 8th is available for them. She explained there had been a misunderstanding: the date had been held for them, but another assistant had requested it, and it appeared as if the slot was taken. If they were still good for July 8 at 1:00 PM via Zoom, they would have it confirmed.\n\nThe thread also shows a later exchange. At 11:10 AM, Bryce wrote to Katie Nelson Dunn (with Cecelia Neltner, Greg Neltner, and Whitney Moore CC’d) that July 9 would work for him. Bryce’s signature followed, reiterating his office information.\n\nAt 11:04 AM, Katie asked Bryce whether he was available for a Zoom deposition if Linda Hopgood could not accommodate July 8 after all. She reported that Linda’s office had informed them Linda is no longer available on July 8 and asked if Bryce was available on July 9, 10, or 17 for a Zoom deposition.\n\nEarlier, at 10:54 AM, Bryce had indicated that “No Zoom would be great,” suggesting a preference for an in-person mediation rather than Zoom, though he later agreed to consider Zoom options as the schedule evolved.\n\nAt 10:48 AM, Katie had written that Linda Hopgood was available on July 8 at 1 PM via Zoom and asked whether there were any objections to conducting the mediation via Zoom. The thread then continued with the replies noted above, including Bryce’s indication that July 9 would work for him.\n\nThroughout the thread, the participants used the CC’d Filevine project addresses for Greg Neltner MVA 4/1/2023 and Cecelia Neltner MVA 4/1/2023, alongside standard email disclaimers about privilege and confidentiality. The conversation centers on coordinating a mediation (and related deposition) for the Neltner v. Cohara matter, with Linda Hopgood serving as the mediator and July 8 at 1:00 PM via Zoom initially proposed, then adjusted as availability changed, with subsequent options including July 9, 10, or 17 for a Zoom deposition.",

      "natural_language": "In the Neltner v. Cohara matter, the case is recorded as Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023, with Greg Neltner as the client. The note you provided is a sequence of email communications among counsel discussing scheduling for mediation and a Zoom deposition related to the matter. The email thread begins with W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, writing to Katie Nelson Dunn and Whitney Moore of Richardson Law Group, with cc’d Filevine project email addresses for Greg Neltner and Cecelia Neltner (MVA 4/1/2023). The July 7, 2025 email from Bryce asks Katie for the Zoom link for “tomorrow’s mediation,” and Bryce’s firm contact details are provided: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message includes the standard privilege and error-notice disclaimer typical of these firm emails.\n\nThe email chain contains several messages from May 15, 2025 that revolve around scheduling dates. In one message, Bryce writes: “Not a worry - the 8th at 1pm it is.” This appears to be a confirmation of a date and time, presumably for the mediation. In a companion message, Whitney Moore indicates that Linda’s office advised the 8th is available to them, though there had been a misunderstanding because another assistant had requested the date and it had appeared as taken. Whitney adds: “If you are still good for the 8th at 1pm zoom we will have it confirmed.” Whitney’s message includes her Richardson Law Group signature block, which lists 334 Beechwood Road Suite 502, Ft. Mitchell, KY 41017; phone 859-444-4949; fax 859-219-9292, and her email address WMoore@RichardsonLawGrp.com, along with links to the firm’s website and the usual environment notice.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Bryce indicates: “July 9 will work for me.” In response, Katie (from Richardson Law Group) explains that Linda’s office informed them Linda is no longer available on July 8 and asks whether Bryce is available for a Zoom deposition on July 9, July 10, or July 17. Bryce replies with the remark “No Zoom would be great,” followed by his signature. He later reiterates, “July 9 will work for me,” in another message, and Katie again references Linda’s unavailability on July 8 and asks about the July 9, 10, or 17 options for the Zoom deposition. After this, Bryce confirms that “July 9 will work for me” and indicates the possibility of a Zoom depo on those dates. The thread includes the usual attorney-client privilege notices and the firm contact details for both The Whaley Law Firm and Richardson Law Group.\n\nThe May 15 sequence also contains the standard notices present in each email, including disclaimers about privilege, instructions to contact the sending firm if the message was received in error, and reminders about not forwarding the content to unauthorized recipients. The May messages also show the email signatures with the respective firm details and contact information, and in Whitney Moore’s message there are embedded images (cid:image001.png, cid:image002.png, cid:image003.png) within the email body, as well as a notice encouraging environmental consideration before printing.\n\nIn summary, the thread documents ongoing scheduling discussions in May 2025 for a Zoom deposition and a mediation in the Neltner v. Cohara matter, with Greg Neltner’s counsel seeking to coordinate dates and obtain the Zoom link for the mediation set around early July. The parties alternately considered July 8 at 1:00 PM (which Linda’s office later indicated was no longer available), and July 9 (with July 10 or July 17 as alternatives for the Zoom deposition), while Bryce and Katie and Whitney continued to negotiate preferred dates. The July 7, 2025 email from Bryce to Katie about obtaining the Zoom link for “tomorrow’s mediation” closes the note, with the cc’d Filevine addresses for Greg and Cecelia Neltner and the same firm contact details and privilege notices appearing in the thread.",

      "natural_language": "This case note concerns Greg Neltner in a multi-party motor vehicle accident matter, documented under the file label Greg-Neltner-MVA-4-1-2023. The work completed involved full file organization using an eight-bucket structure and content-based naming. Phase 1 established a complete inventory and setup for parallel processing.\n\nIn Phase 1, the team generated a file inventory totaling 253 files. They scrambled 177 .md filenames to eliminate naming bias, created a PDF-to-MD mapping for reunification, and split the inventory into 16 chunks to enable parallel processing. Phase 2 followed with a parallel workflow involving 16 sub-agents, each analyzing roughly 11 files. The analysis was based solely on file content, with no reliance on filenames, and a comprehensive reorganization map was created for all 253 files. The team applied a standardized naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD - Client Name - Category - Originator - Description. They identified 15 duplicate court filing emails for deletion and noted that the case involved multiple parties, with Cecelia Neltner-specific documents found within Greg’s folder.\n\nPhase 3, the Quality Review, completed with an error rate of 1.5% (3 errors out of about 200 files checked). The main agent corrected three issues: two files were incorrectly marked as duplicates when they were, in fact, different court filings from different dates (8/26/2024 and 2/12/2025), and one file was mis-categorized as \"Negotiation Settlement\" when it should have been \"Litigation\" (a deposition scheduling email). Additionally, the team verified that the 15 duplicate court filing emails were safe to delete.\n\nPhase 4, Execution, involved 252 file operations. A total of 243 files were moved into the proper eight-bucket structure with the following distribution: Litigation 113 files (covering discovery, depositions, court filings, and notices); Client 45 files (communications, intake, voicemails); Medical Records 19 files (seven providers with subdirectories); Insurance 16 files (BI/Progressive, PIP/State Farm, PIP/KY Assigned Claims); Investigation 12 files (police reports, property damage photos); Expenses 10 files (court reporter invoices); Negotiation Settlement 7 files (demand letters); Case Information 16 files (JSON data files); and Lien 1 file (State Farm subrogation). The team deleted 15 duplicate court filing notification emails, and no PDF reunification was required because there were no PDFs in this case—the documents were already in .md, .eml, .docx, or .jpg formats.\n\nPhase 5, Verification, confirmed that all eight bucket directories were properly organized, and naming convention compliance was 100%. Companion file matching was also 100% (all EML files had corresponding .md companions). Ten files remained in the root directory (about 4%): two were flagged for poor OCR quality, four were deposition transcript duplicates (PTX/TXT versions), two were case data files, and two were uncategorized court emails. In total, 243 of 253 files were organized, representing 96% completion.\n\nCritical case information uncovered includes: a multi-party matter with Greg Neltner and Cecelia Neltner as co-plaintiffs against Trinity Cohara; active litigation in Boone Circuit Court (Case 24-CI-00452); depositions completed for Greg Neltner and Cecelia Neltner on 9/17/2024; Trinity Cohara’s deposition scheduled for 3/21/2025 at 2:00 PM; defense counsel listed as Richardson Law Group (Katie Nelson, Josh Leckrone, Maeve Weihl); Progressive (BI carrier) denied liability on 10/17/2023; State Farm PIP paid $6,000 to Southgate Chiropractic (claim #1747Q474T); State Farm subrogation lien of $6,000 (letter dated 10/9/2024); settlement demands sent by Greg on 10/3/2023 and by Cecelia on 11/25/2024; a medical update noting Greg went to the ER on 2/13/2025 for chronic arthritis of the C3 region and other areas; medical providers involved include Southgate Chiropractic (primary), St Elizabeth Healthcare, St Elizabeth Primary Care, BUC Independence LLC (Cecelia), and New Orleans Orthopedic Institute.\n\nResult: The case file is now organized within a proper eight-bucket structure using a standardized naming convention, with files correctly categorized and easily retrievable. Quality metrics indicate 98.5% initial accuracy, 100% accuracy after main agent corrections, and 100% duplicate detection accuracy following those corrections.",
