      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Colvin-MVA-10-1-2023. Client: Shannon Colvin.\n\nOn September 10, 2024, The Whaley Law Firm’s W. Bryce Koon, Esq., forwarded an email titled “Fwd: Collen & Shannon Colvin (04908174)” to Shannon Colvin and Colleen Colvin at their Filevine project email addresses. The message was dated 10:58:47 AM (Eastern Time). In the forwarded thread, Bryce’s message was sent to Shannon Colvin MVA 10/01/2023 and Colleen Colvin MVA 10/01/2023, both at their respective Filevine email addresses.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Ben Taylor, a Claim Adjuster II for Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance at the Campbellsville Regional Office, replied to Bryce. In his message, dated September 10, 2024 (at approximately 10:56 AM), he wrote: “Good morning, I have received your email and have advised our litigation department of this.” He then provided his contact details: Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance, Campbellsville Regional Office, 110 Nancy Cox Drive, Campbellsville, KY 42718. He also noted the mailing address for correspondence: PO Box 20400, Louisville, KY 40250-9802. His office phone number is (270) 465-9771, his cell is 270-849-4104, and his fax is (270) 600-2648. He added kyfb.com and a “Member login” link.\n\n Bryce Koon had, in turn, written earlier in the thread on the same day, September 10, 2024 at 10:45 AM, to Ben Taylor with Colleen Colvin MVA 10/01/2023 and Shannon Colvin MVA 10/01/2023 CC’d. The subject line read “Collen & Shannon Colvin (04908174).” In that message, Bryce stated: “Good morning, Please see attached filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court. Thank you, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Phone: (502) 365-5043. Fax: (502) 237-3207.” An image was noted as removed by the sender. The message included a standard confidentiality notice indicating that it was intended only for the named recipient and that any attachment or information should not be used or forwarded if received in error; it advised contacting The Whaley Law Firm and noted that no waiver of privilege should be inferred.\n\nThe overall thread confirms a filing was attached as “filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court” in the Collen & Shannon Colvin matter (04908174), related to the Shannon-Colvin-MVA-10-1-2023 case, and it shows communication between The Whaley Law Firm and the Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance claim office, with appropriate contact information and confidentiality notices in place.",
