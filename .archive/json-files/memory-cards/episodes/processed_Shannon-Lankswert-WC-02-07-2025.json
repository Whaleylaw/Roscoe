      "natural_language": "Case Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 involves the client, Shannon Lankswert. The record describes an incident involving a friend of the client who works for UPS as a 3rd shift fueler. This friend went to the bathroom in a fuel yard and fell down metal stairs on her way out, striking her back and both arms/elbows during the descent. The employer transported her to Concentra, where she was advised of back and arm injuries. Concentra checked the arm and took X-rays but reportedly ignored the back injury and issued a \"work as tolerated\" note.\n\nThe client followed up with Flaget Memorial when the pain had not subsided and was placed off work at least until 02/13. On 02/13, the client returned to Concentra for physical therapy. Concentra advised the client that they are 'Not allowed by Law to place off work due to Account with UPS.' Concentra provided work restrictions, but UPS was unable to accommodate the restrictions, effectively forcing the client to use vacation time and PTO instead of initiating a workers\u2019 compensation claim. The client has been off work since the date of injury (DOI). It was advised that UPS should have initiated a workers\u2019 compensation claim once off work for more than 3 days. The client is not sure how to proceed. I advised that an Intake Packet would be sent and the case marked on hold until she decides whether she wants us to be fully involved. The client appreciated the information and requested that the Intake Packet be emailed to her.",

The client intake was received, setup completed, a turnover letter was sent to the employer, and a copy was provided to the client.\n\nAn introductory call was completed; the client remains in pain and had called in last night. The client states that her supervisor advised they cannot accommodate her restrictions. She cited another injured employee who is also not accommodated, with that employee made to sit in the breakroom for eight hours. The client is not comfortable with this arrangement, as sitting for long periods is difficult and the breakroom chairs are not padded. She was advised to make the best of it and, if it becomes unbearable, to report it and update the supervisor. She was also advised to photograph the chairs if they are placed in the breakroom for the evening. Additionally, she was advised that we would locate a provider near her, since she has the right to choose a provider. Concentra advised the client that, due to their account with UPS, they are not legally allowed to place the client off work.\n\nAdvanced Injury & Rehab in Bardstown accepts workers\u2019 compensation and has an opening for tomorrow, weather permitting; if not, they will certainly see the client on Thursday at 2:00 p.m. Appointment information was sent to the client via text.\n\nThis contact was made by Sarena on February 18 2025.",

The Whaley Law Firm, representing Shannon, notified her on February 20, 2025, that a new workers\u2019 compensation adjuster, Kaitlin Ericksen, had been assigned to Shannon\u2019s claim. The firm instructed Shannon not to speak with Ms. Ericksen, Mr. Stewart, or any other individuals who may reach out to her, and to refer all such inquiries back to the Whaley Law Firm for further assistance. They advised that the carrier has been provided with all documentation Shannon had supplied, and they had completed a Kentucky Department of Workers Claims (KY DWC) Form 114 for travel reimbursement for Shannon\u2019s appointment up to that date. Shannon was asked to keep the firm posted after each of her visits so that Form 114 reimbursements could continue, and to contact the firm directly with any questions.\n\nIn a forwarded message dated February 20, 2025, at 11:16 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm addressed Kaitlin Ericksen and copied Bryce Koon. She stated that the firm was attaching their office\u2019s letter of representation, KY DWC Form 106, KY DWC Form 113, and KY DWC Form 114 for the related claim, along with injury photos and scene photos for the file. Ms. Lankswert had an appointment that afternoon at 2:00 PM with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. Tuttle explained that UPS had delayed processing the claim, and Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor had informed her that they could not accommodate the restrictions set by Concentra; however, she was still required to drive more than 35 miles to the property and to sit in a breakroom for the evening. Because of her injuries, Shannon had been advised not to drive long distances and could not sit in the provided chairs, as evidenced by photos. These circumstances led Shannon to use vacation time and to incur occurrences for missed time. The firm requested that TTD (Temporary Total Disability) benefits be processed as soon as possible and asked that Shannon\u2019s vacation time and Attendance Status be reinstated promptly to prevent future issues. They emphasized that Shannon should not have accrued any occurrences or been punished for her work-related injury. The message concluded with an invitation to contact the firm with any questions and expressed a hope for an amicable resolution.\n\nEarlier that same day, on February 20, 2025, at 10:36 AM, Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II with Liberty Mutual Insurance, wrote to Shannon. She introduced herself as the adjuster assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and invited Shannon to reach out if she needed anything. Ericksen\u2019s signature block included her contact information: Liberty Mutual Insurance, Indianapolis, IN; Office: 317-483-8037; Fax: 603-422-6845; Mailing Address: P.O. Box 7170, Indianapolis, IN 46207. The email also contained standard confidentiality and privilege notices, stating that the information in the email and any attachments is confidential and may be privileged or constitute attorney work product, and provided instructions for unintended recipients to notify the sender, refrain from using or disseminating the content, and destroy copies. A privacy notice was also referenced via a Privacy Policy website link.\n\nOverall, the communications document the case\u2019s status as of February 20, 2025, including the assignment of a new adjuster, the exchange of representation documents and forms (106, 113, 114), upcoming medical evaluation, travel reimbursement considerations, work restrictions challenges, vacation-time implications, and the stated aim to initiate benefits and rectify attendance records promptly, all within the context of ongoing attempts to achieve an amicable resolution.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025\nClient: Shannon Lankswert\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Liberty Mutual claims staff exchanged information regarding Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim (WC80D-H07503). Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Claims group in Indianapolis, informed Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm that UPS could accommodate the restrictions provided, and that there was no driving restriction in writing. She also stated that Liberty Mutual could not pay temporary total disability (TTD) benefits at that time, because it appeared there was work available within Ms. Lankswert\u2019s restrictions.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:17 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent a response with attachments and additional details. She noted that the office\u2019s letter of representation and Kentucky Department of Workers\u2019 Claims forms KY DWC Form 106, 113, and 114 for the related claim were attached, along with injury photos and scene photos. Ms. Lankswert was scheduled for an appointment this afternoon at 2:00 PM with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. Tuttle explained that UPS had delayed processing this claim, and that Ms. Lankswert had been advised by her immediate supervisor that they could not accommodate the restrictions set by Concentra; nonetheless, she remained required to drive more than 35 miles to the property and to sit in a breakroom for the evening. Because of her injuries, she was advised not to drive for long periods and could not sit in the chairs provided, as shown in the photos. This situation had forced Ms. Lankswert to use vacation time and accrue occurrences for the time she missed. Tuttle urged immediate processing of her TTD benefits and asked that Liberty Mutual reinstate Ms. Lankswert\u2019s vacation time and attendance status as soon as possible to avoid future issues, stressing that she should not have accrued any occurrences or been punished for the work-related injury. She invited any questions and expressed a desire to work toward an amicable resolution.\n\nAlso on February 20, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen sent a follow-up note clarifying that she is the adjuster assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and inviting the recipient to reach out if anything else was needed. This message preceded and complemented the detailed update regarding accommodations, restrictions, and the need to timely process TTD benefits and correct attendance records.\n\nThe communications include standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of the claims correspondence, and they reference the case details, the related Kentucky workers\u2019 claim forms and attachments, as well as photos documenting Ms. Lankswert\u2019s injuries and scene, all tied to the WC80D-H07503 claim.",

Again, Ms. Lankswert is a\nFuel Truck Driver which requires her to sit for long periods of time, lift\nheavy hoses & climb stairs, all of which causes additional pain & delays to\nher recovery. Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert in lieu of\nplacing her off work only due to the fact Concentra apparently has a\nstanding order from UPS (who are not medical professionals) to NOT place\ntheir employees off work (unethical on so many levels). Ms. Lankswert is\nnot able to drive due to being unable to sit for long periods of time, she\nis unable to lift the hoses and she is unable to repeatedly climb stairs. These\nare noted in her restrictions provided to you earlier today.\n\n ***May lift up to 10lbs (Hoses weigh well more than 10lbs)\n ***May push/pull up to 10 lbs (Again, hoses weigh more than\n10lbs)\n ***May bend *occasionally *(occasionally defined as upto\n3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement with\ngetting in & out of truck)\n ***May engage in activities requiring trunk rotation *occasionally\n*(again defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler this is a constant\nrequired activity)\n* ***Will need to alternate sitting & standing for pain\ncontrol *(cannot\nalternate sitting & standing as needed if actively fueling)\n* ***No squatting, kneeling or climbing ladders *(Ladders are\nrequired to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses)\n\n *UPS themselves, via Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor Amy Roy, have\nadvised they can not accommodate* her restrictions & that she is to sit in\nthe breakroom all evening. Sitting in a breakroom is not the equivalent to\naccommodating restrictions, especially when this is causing harm/pain\nto the injured party with a *Tailbone Injury* as documented in her Flaget\nRecords. Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an\nunbiased provider and will have updated documents later this afternoon.\nHowever, TTD should be issued for the time already missed & the\noccurrences should\nbe removed from her attendance file immediately due to UPS's strict\nadherence to their attendance policy and subsequent termination should an\nemployee use all available occurrences.\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert. Re: Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert.\n\nThe record begins with an email chain dated February 20, 2025, in which Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II for Liberty Mutual Insurance, with Bryce Koon copied. In her message, tittle-fast The Whaley Law Firm argued that Ms. Lankswert should be compensated from the date of the incident through her release back to full duty. Tuttle noted that Ms. Lankswert is a Fuel Truck Driver, a role that requires sitting for long periods, lifting hoses that weigh more than 10 pounds, and climbing stairs, all of which contribute to pain and delay recovery. She asserted that Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert instead of authorizing time off because Concentra has a standing order from UPS not to place their employees off work, a policy Tuttle described as unethical. According to the message, Ms. Lankswert cannot drive because she cannot sit for long periods, cannot lift the hoses, and cannot repeatedly climb stairs; these restrictions were listed in documents provided to the adjuster earlier that day. The restrictions enumerated by Concentra were: the ability to lift up to 10 pounds, the ability to push/pull up to 10 pounds, bending occasionally (defined as up to 3 hours per day for a full-time Fueler, where bending is a constant requirement for entering and exiting the truck), occasional trunk rotation (also up to 3 hours per day, a constant requirement for fueling), alternating sitting and standing for pain control (which could not be maintained if actively fueling), no squatting, kneeling, or climbing ladders (ladders are needed to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses). Tuttle stated that UPS, via Ms. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor Amy Roy, advised that they cannot accommodate these restrictions and instructed Ms. Lankswert to sit in the breakroom all evening. She emphasized that sitting in the breakroom does not constitute accommodation and can cause harm and pain to a person with a tailbone injury documented in Flaget Records. The message also noted that Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an unbiased provider and would have updated documents later that afternoon. Finally, Tuttle argued that Temporary Total Disability (TTD) should be issued for time already missed, that occurrences should be removed from her attendance file due to UPS\u2019s strict attendance policy, and that termination could occur if an employee exhausts all available occurrences.\n\nThe email from Kaitlin Ericksen responding to this point was sent later the same day, February 20, 2025, at approximately 12:33 PM. Ericksen stated that UPS is able to accommodate the restrictions provided and that she did not see any driving restriction in writing. She concluded that, at that time, TTD could not be paid because it appeared there was work available within Ms. Lankswert\u2019s restrictions.\n\nEarlier in the day, at 10:17 AM, a separate email from Sarena Tuttle to Kaitlin Ericksen (with Bryce Koon cc\u2019d) extended further documentation and context. Tuttle attached the office\u2019s letter of representation along with Kentucky Department of Workers\u2019 Claims (KY DWC) Forms 106, 113, and 114 for the related claim, as well as injury photos and scene photos. She noted that Ms. Lankswert had an appointment that afternoon at 2:00 PM with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. Tuttle stated that UPS had delayed processing of the claim and that Ms. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor advised that they could not accommodate the restrictions but required her to drive more than 35 miles to the property and sit in a breakroom for the evening. She described that, due to her injuries, Ms. Lankswert had been advised not to drive for long periods and could not sit in the chairs provided, with photos supporting this claim. As a result, Ms. Lankswert had to use vacation time and would receive occurrences for the time missed. Tuttle urged that processing of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s TTD benefits begin as soon as possible and requested that UPS reinstate Ms. Lankswert\u2019s vacation time and attendance status to avoid future issues. She asserted that Ms. Lankswert should not have accrued any occurrences or been penalized for a work-related injury, and she welcomed any questions while expressing a desire to work toward an amicable resolution.\n\nAdditionally, the same thread includes an earlier message from Kaitlin Ericksen dated February 20, 2025, at 10:36 AM, in which she introduced herself as the adjuster assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and invited contact if anything was needed.\n\nThe messages include standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of Liberty Mutual communications, reminding recipients to contact the sender if they are not the intended recipient, to refrain from disseminating the message or attachments, and to consult the company\u2019s privacy notice. The record also shows the parties and contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with Sarena M. Tuttle\u2019s direct line and email address provided, and Liberty Mutual\u2019s Indianapolis, Indiana office contact details for Kaitlin Ericksen.\n\nIn sum, the communications document a dispute over appropriate compensation and time loss following a tailbone injury for a fuel truck driver, the restrictions imposed by Concentra and UPS, the alleged lack of accommodation, and requests for TTD processing and removal of attendance occurrences, all within the context of a claim identified as WC80D-H07503 and the case Shannon Lankswert.",

Again, Ms. Lankswert is a Fuel Truck Driver which requires her to sit for long periods of time, lift heavy hoses & climb stairs, all of which causes additional pain & delays to her recovery. Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert in lieu of placing her off work only due to the fact Concentra apparently has a standing order from UPS (who are not medical professionals) to NOT place their employees off work (unethical on so many levels). Ms. Lankswert is not able to drive due to being unable to sit for long periods of time, she is unable to lift the hoses and she is unable to repeatedly climb stairs. These are noted in her restrictions provided to you earlier today.\n\n ***May lift up to 10lbs (Hoses weigh well more than 10lbs)\n ***May push/pull up to 10 lbs (Again, hoses weigh more than 10lbs)\n ***May bend occasionally (occasionally defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement with getting in & out of truck)\n ***May engage in activities requiring trunk rotation occasionally (again defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler this is a constant required activity)\n ***Will need to alternate sitting & standing for pain control (cannot alternate sitting & standing as needed if actively fueling)\n ***No squatting, kneeling or climbing ladders (Ladders are required to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses)\n\n UPS themselves, via Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor Amy Roy, have advised they can not accommodate her restrictions & that she is to sit in the breakroom all evening. Sitting in a breakroom is not the equivalent to accommodating restrictions, especially when this is causing harm/pain to the injured party with a Tailbone Injury as documented in her Flaget Records. Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an unbiased provider and will have updated documents later this afternoon. However, TTD should be issued for the time already missed & the occurrences should be removed from her attendance file immediately due to UPS's strict adherence to their attendance policy and subsequent termination should an employee use all available occurrences.\n\nSarena M.

      "natural_language": "On February 20, 2025, in the case Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 (Re: Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert), Liberty Mutual Insurance and The Whaley Law Firm exchanged a series of emails concerning Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The client, Shannon Lankswert, is described in the communications as a Fuel Truck Driver. The subject line shows the matter as Re: Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert and the participants included Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II with Liberty Mutual, and Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nEarlier in the day, at 10:17 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent an email with the office\u2019s letter of representation for Ms. Lankswert along with KY DWC Forms 106, 113, and 114, plus injury and scene photos for the file. She noted that Ms. Lankswert had an appointment that afternoon at 2:00 PM with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. She stated that UPS had apparently delayed arranging accommodations by Concentra, and that Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor had advised that UPS could not accommodate her restrictions. According to Sarena, Shannon is required to drive more than 35 miles to the property and to sit in a breakroom for the evening, which she argued was not an accommodation of her restrictions. She described Shannon\u2019s tailbone injury as documented in Flaget Records and stated Shannon had been advised not to drive for long periods and could not sit in the chairs provided (photos were submitted). Sarena asserted that Shannon had to use vacation time and was accruing \u201coccurrences\u201d under UPS\u2019s attendance policy and risked termination for using all available occurrences. She requested that TTD (temporary total disability) benefits be issued for the time Shannon missed and asked that Shannon\u2019s vacation time and attendance status be reinstated to avoid future issues. She also asked for any necessary steps to begin processing TTD benefits promptly and to remove the occurrences from Shannon\u2019s attendance file. The email included Sarena\u2019s contact information and noted a new email address for her.\n\nEarlier still, at 10:36 AM, Kaitlin Ericksen, the Liberty Mutual adjuster assigned to Shannon\u2019s claim, replied briefly to say she was the adjuster on the case and invited the Whaley Law Firm to let her know if anything was needed.\n\nAt 12:33 PM, Kaitlin sent another message indicating that UPS could accommodate the restrictions provided and that there did not appear to be any driving restriction in writing. Based on that, she stated that TTD could not be paid at that time because there was work available within Shannon\u2019s restrictions.\n\nAt 1:44 PM, Sarena responded to Kaitlin with a detailed restatement of Shannon\u2019s restrictions and the situation. She reiterated that Shannon should be compensated appropriately from the date of the incident until she is released back to full duty. She reiterated Shannon\u2019s job duties as a Fuel Truck Driver, which require long periods of sitting, lifting hoses that weigh more than 10 pounds, and climbing stairs, all of which contribute to pain and delay recovery. She described Concentra as having placed restrictions rather than authorizing off-work status, allegedly due to a standing order from UPS (characterized by Sarena as unethical). She enumerated Shannon\u2019s restrictions:\n\n- May lift up to 10 pounds (hoses weigh more than 10 pounds).\n- May push/pull up to 10 pounds (hoses weigh more than 10 pounds).\n- May bend occasionally (up to 3 hours per day; as a full-time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement for getting in and out of the truck).\n- May engage in trunk rotation occasionally (up to 3 hours per day; again a constant required activity for a Fueler).\n- Will need to alternate sitting and standing for pain control (cannot alternate as needed if actively fueling).\n- No squatting, kneeling, or climbing ladders (ladders are required to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses).\n\nShe added that UPS, via Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor Amy Roy, had advised they could not accommodate the restrictions and that Shannon was to sit in the breakroom all evening. This, she argued, was not a true accommodation and caused harm/pain to the injured party, consistent with the tailbone injury documented in the medical records. Shannon had chosen to pursue medical treatment with an unbiased provider and would provide updated documents later that afternoon. Sarena asserted that TTD should be issued for the time Shannon had already missed and that the occurrences should be removed from Shannon\u2019s attendance file given UPS\u2019s strict attendance policy. She urged beginning processing of Shannon\u2019s TTD benefits and asked for Shannon\u2019s vacation time and attendance status to be reinstated to prevent further issues, stating that Shannon should not have accrued any occurrences or been punished for a work-related injury. The email closed with Sarena\u2019s signature and her firm\u2019s contact details.\n\nLater that same day, Kaitlin replied at 20:54:46 UTC, stating that UPS had confirmed suitable light-duty work was available and that, accordingly, TTD benefits would not be issued at that time.\n\nAcross the message thread, the email confidentiality notices and standard disclaimers were included by both parties, with frequent references to the confidential nature of the information and the privacy notices on Liberty Mutual\u2019s and The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s communications. The chain also included standard firm signatures, and repeated contact details for both Kaitlin Ericksen and Sarena Tuttle, as well as references to the documents and photos being provided for the file.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert. Re: Re: Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s litigation team, led by Sarena M. Tuttle, is handling a workers\u2019 compensation matter identified as WC80D-H07503 for Shannon Lankswert, with communications between Ms. Tuttle and Liberty Mutual Claims Specialist Kaitlin Ericksen regarding temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, work restrictions, and related delays.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Ms. Tuttle forwarded a detailed update in the external matter. She explained that Shannon Lankswert had missed days due to her injury and that UPS had not provided suitable light\u2011duty work. Ms. Tuttle requested that TTD benefits be backdated to the date of Shannon\u2019s incident to cover the days she could not work. She noted that Flaget Memorial had placed Shannon off work for a minimum of three days, from February 11 to February 14, 2025, and that Shannon had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon. An attached Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab was referenced, and Ms. Tuttle urged Liberty Mutual to initiate the requested TTD benefits. She also stated that if the carrier refused to provide the benefits required by Kentucky state law, the file should be forwarded to legal counsel to avoid further delays, emphasizing that the claim had already been intentionally delayed by almost two weeks.\n\nEarlier in the day, Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual had communicated that UPS had confirmed suitable light\u2011duty work was available, and accordingly, TTD benefits would not be issued at that time. Ms. Tuttle subsequently responded with a more detailed description of Shannon\u2019s restrictions and the impact on her ability to work.\n\nAt 10:17 AM, Ms. Tuttle sent an email attaching the firm\u2019s representation letter and Kentucky Division of Workers\u2019 Claims forms 106, 113, and 114, along with injury and scene photos for Shannon\u2019s file. She noted that Shannon had a 2:00 PM appointment that afternoon with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. She also indicated that UPS had delayed processing of the claim and that Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor had advised that the restrictions provided by Concentra could not be accommodated; Shannon would be required to drive more than 35 miles to the property and sit in a breakroom for the evening. Ms. Tuttle emphasized that Shannon\u2019s tailbone injury was documented in Flaget Records and that Shannon had elected to pursue treatment with an unbiased provider, with updated documents to be provided later that afternoon. She urged that TTD be issued for the time Shannon had already missed and requested removal of occurrences from her attendance file due to UPS\u2019s attendance policy.\n\nAt 12:33 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that UPS could accommodate the restrictions provided and that there was no driving restriction in writing. Based on this, she stated that TTD could not be paid at that time, as there was work available within Shannon\u2019s restrictions.\n\nAt 1:44 PM, Sarena Tuttle responded again to Kaitlin, detailing Shannon\u2019s restrictions and the practical implications for her job as a Fuel Truck Driver. The posted restrictions included: lifting up to 10 pounds (hoses weigh more than 10 pounds); pushing/pulling up to 10 pounds (hoses weigh more than 10 pounds); bending occasionally (up to 3 hours per day, as a full\u2011time Fueler bending is a constant requirement); engaging in trunk rotation occasionally (up to 3 hours per day, also a constant requirement for fueling); alternating sitting and standing for pain control (which would be difficult while actively fueling); no squatting, kneeling, or climbing ladders (ladders are required to enter planes to check fuel levels and to connect/disconnect hoses). She also noted that UPS, through Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor Amy Roy, had advised they could not accommodate Shannon\u2019s restrictions and instructed her to sit in the breakroom all evening. Ms. Tuttle stated that Shannon had chosen to move her medical treatment to an unbiased provider and anticipated updated documentation that afternoon. She reiterated that TTD should be issued for time missed and that the occurrences should be removed from Shannon\u2019s attendance file due to UPS\u2019s strict attendance policy and potential termination for using all available occurrences.\n\nKaitlin Ericksen followed up at 3:54 PM stating that UPS would be able to accommodate the restrictions and that there was no driving restriction in writing. Consequently, she advised that TTD would not be paid at that time because work was available within Shannon\u2019s restrictions.\n\nIn the final message of the day, at 5:55 PM, Sarena Tuttle addressed Kaitlin directly with a pointed summary. She explained that Shannon had missed days due to her injury and that UPS could not provide suitable light\u2011duty work. She requested that TTD benefits be backdated to Shannon\u2019s incident date to cover the days she was unable to work and noted that Flaget Memorial had placed Shannon off work for at least three days (February 11\u201314, 2025) and that Shannon remained off work indefinitely as of that afternoon. Ms. Tuttle attached the Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab and reiterated the need to initiate TTD benefits that had been requested three times. She warned that if Liberty Mutual continued to refuse the eligible benefits required by Kentucky state law, the file should be forwarded to Liberty Mutual\u2019s legal counsel to avoid further delays, asserting that Shannon\u2019s claim had already been delayed almost two weeks and that such delays were unacceptable.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the parties referenced Shannon\u2019s tailbone injury, the restrictions provided to UPS, the involvement of Concentra, and the ongoing tension between accommodation of restrictions and the payment of TTD. The case file includes a letter of representation, Kentucky DWC Forms 106, 113, and 114, injury and scene photos, and documentation of Shannon\u2019s appointment with Advanced Injury Rehab, with ongoing efforts to obtain timely and compliant TTD benefits under Kentucky law.",

To date, we\nstill have not received any response to our correspondence dated February\n20th, 2025 in relation to Mrs. Lankswert's TTD Benefits and/or Form 114\nReimbursements.\n Upon review of the Concentra Medical Records, it appears the wrong job\ndescription had been provided to them. According to their records, they\nwere provided \"Air Handler\" as Mrs. Lankswert's job title & based her\nrestrictions on the provided 'Air Handler Job Description'. Please confirm\nthat your file reflects the correct job title of \"Full Time Fueler\". These\nare 2 very different types of jobs and the restrictions provided do not\nallow Mrs. Lankswert to fulfill her duties as a 'Full Time Fueler' while\nthey may be sufficient for an \"Air Handler\" who sorts packages for a short\nperiod of time (3-4hrs) each shift. Furthermore, these departments are\ncompletely separate from each other & again, Mrs. Lankswert immediate\nsupervisor, is unable to accommodate her restrictions as provided by\nConcentra. However, again, Mrs. Lankswert was placed off work on February\n20th for an indefinite period, we assume at least until her next\nevaluation.

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert.\n\nOn February 25, 2025, The Whaley Law Firm, via Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager Sarena M. Tuttle, sent Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual an email with attachments containing certified medical records from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital related to Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s injuries. The message noted that Liberty Mutual had not yet responded to the firm\u2019s February 20, 2025 correspondence concerning Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and/or Form 114 reimbursements. In reviewing the Concentra records, the firm observed that the wrong job description had been provided to Concentra: the records list Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s job title as \u201cAir Handler,\u201d and the restrictions were based on that description. The email asked Liberty Mutual to confirm that the file reflects the correct job title of \u201cFull Time Fueler,\u201d explaining that these are two very different roles and that the restrictions tied to the Air Handler description do not permit Mrs. Lankswert to perform the duties of a Full Time Fueler. The note also explained that the two departments are separate, and Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor cannot accommodate the restrictions provided by Concentra. Nevertheless, Mrs. Lankswert was placed off work on February 20 for an indefinite period, presumably at least until her next evaluation. The email requested an immediate update on the status of her claim and provided Sarena Tuttle\u2019s contact information, including her new email address.\n\nEarlier that week, on February 20, 2025, at approximately 5:55 PM, Sarena Tuttle wrote Kaitlin Ericksen to report that Mrs. Lankswert had missed days due to her injury and that UPS could not provide suitable light-duty work. Tuttle stated that Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s TTD payments should be backdated to the date of the incident to cover the days she was unable to work. She noted that Flaget Memorial had placed Mrs. Lankswert off work for a minimum of three days, from February 11 to February 14, 2025, and that Mrs. Lankswert had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon. Tuttle attached a Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab and urged initiating TTD benefits, which she stated had been requested three times. She warned that if Liberty Mutual continued to refuse the eligible benefits required by Kentucky state law, the file should be forwarded to Liberty Mutual\u2019s legal counsel to avoid further delays. She concluded by saying that the claim had already been intentionally delayed nearly two weeks and that this was unacceptable.\n\nEarlier still, at 12:33 PM on February 20, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that UPS had stated they could accommodate the restrictions and that there was no driving restriction in writing. Based on this, she said Liberty Mutual could not pay TTD at that time because there was work available within Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s restrictions.\n\nAt 1:44 PM on February 20, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent a more detailed message to Kaitlin Ericksen (cc\u2019ing Bryce Koon) under the subject line indicated in the thread. She argued that Mrs. Lankswert should be compensated from the date of the incident until she is released back to full duty. She explained that Mrs. Lankswert is a Fuel Truck Driver, which requires sitting for long periods, lifting heavy hoses, and climbing stairs\u2014activities that cause additional pain and delay her recovery. She criticized Concentra for providing restrictions based on a description that did not match her actual job duties and asserted that UPS, via Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor, Amy Roy, had advised that they could not accommodate the restrictions and instructed her to sit in the breakroom. Tuttle contended that sitting in a breakroom does not constitute an accommodation and noted that Mrs. Lankswert had begun medical treatment with an unbiased provider, with updated documents expected later that afternoon. She argued that TTD should be issued for the time already missed and that occurrences should be removed from Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s attendance file due to UPS\u2019s strict attendance policy and the risk of termination for using all available occurrences. She also stated that Liberty Mutual should not delay benefits any further and pressed for timely action.\n\nThat same afternoon, at about 3:54 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that UPS had confirmed suitable light-duty work was available, and therefore Liberty Mutual would not be issuing TTD benefits at that time.\n\nThen, at approximately 5:55 PM on February 20, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent a follow-up message reiterating the earlier points: Ms. Lankswert had missed days because of her injury, UPS could not provide suitable light-duty work, and her TTD payments should be backdated to the incident date to cover the days she could not work. She reiterated that Flaget Memorial had placed Ms. Lankswert off work for a minimum of three days (February 11\u201314, 2025) and that she had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon. She again attached the Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab and requested the initiation of TTD benefits, noting the multiple requests to do so and urging immediate action. She stated that if the eligible benefits required by Kentucky state law were still being refused, the file should be forwarded to Liberty Mutual\u2019s legal counsel to avoid further delays and emphasized that the claim had already been intentionally delayed for nearly two weeks, which she deemed unacceptable.\n\nThis note also includes the sender\u2019s and recipients\u2019 contact details, including Sarena M. Tuttle\u2019s role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and the new email address she referenced in her signature.",

To date, we still have not received any response to our correspondence dated February 20th, 2025 in relation to Mrs. Lankswert's TTD Benefits and/or Form 114 Reimbursements.\n Upon review of the Concentra Medical Records, it appears the wrong job description had been provided to them. According to their records, they were provided \"Air Handler\" as Mrs. Lankswert's job title & based her restrictions on the provided 'Air Handler Job Description'. Please confirm that your file reflects the correct job title of \"Full Time Fueler\". These are 2 very different types of jobs and the restrictions provided do not allow Mrs. Lankswert to fulfill her duties as a 'Full Time Fueler' while they may be sufficient for an \"Air Handler\" who sorts packages for a short period of time (3-4hrs) each shift. Furthermore, these departments are completely separate from each other & again, Mrs. Lankswert immediate supervisor, is unable to accommodate her restrictions as provided by Concentra. However, again, Mrs. Lankswert was placed off work on February 20th for an indefinite period, we assume at least until her next evaluation.

Again, Ms. Lankswert is a Fuel Truck Driver which requires her to sit for long periods of time, lift heavy hoses & climb stairs, all of which causes additional pain & delays to her recovery. Concentra has placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert in lieu of placing her off work only due to the fact Concentra apparently has a standing order from UPS (who are not medical professionals) to NOT place their employees off work (unethical on so many levels). Ms. Lankswert is not able to drive due to being unable to sit for long periods of time, she is unable to lift the hoses and she is unable to repeatedly climb stairs. These are noted in her restrictions provided to you earlier today.\n\n ***May lift up to 10lbs (Hoses weigh well more than 10lbs)\n ***May push/pull up to 10 lbs (Again, hoses weigh more than 10lbs)\n ***May bend occasionally (occasionally defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler, bending is a constant requirement with getting in & out of truck)\n ***May engage in activities requiring trunk rotation occasionally (again defined as upto 3hrs/day - As a Full Time Fueler this is a constant required activity)\n ***Will need to alternate sitting & standing for pain control (cannot alternate sitting & standing as needed if actively fueling)\n ***No squatting, kneeling or climbing ladders (Ladders are required to enter planes to check fuel levels and connect/disconnect hoses)\n\n UPS themselves, via Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor Amy Roy, have advised they can not accommodate her restrictions & that she is to sit in the breakroom all evening. Sitting in a breakroom is not the equivalent to accommodating restrictions, especially when this is causing harm/pain to the injured party with a Tailbone Injury as documented in her Flaget Records. Ms. Lankswert has chosen to move her medical treatment to an unbiased provider and will have updated documents later this afternoon. However, TTD should be issued for the time already missed & the occurrences should be removed from her attendan",
      "natural_language": "In late February 2025, the case of Shannon Lankswert (WC80D-H07503) was the subject of a series of email exchanges between Kaitlin Ericksen, a claims specialist with Liberty Mutual, and Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager with The Whaley Law Firm, regarding Shannon\u2019s eligibility for temporary total disability (TTD) benefits, the appropriate job title and restrictions, and the status of medical records. The exchanges also involved Shannon\u2019s drivers\u2019 obligations and evidence from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital, with a note that Shannon\u2019s claim file includes a request to issue TTD benefits and reimburse Form 114.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent an email in the afternoon attaching certified medical records from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital related to Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s injuries. She noted that they had not yet received a response to their February 20 correspondence concerning TTD benefits and Form 114 reimbursements. In the body of her message, she highlighted a discrepancy in the medical records: Concentra\u2019s files indicated a job title of \u201cAir Handler\u201d and restricted duties based on that description, whereas she requested confirmation that Liberty Mutual\u2019s file reflects the correct title of \u201cFull Time Fueler.\u201d Tuttle explained that \u201cAir Handler\u201d and \u201cFull Time Fueler\u201d describe two very different roles, and the restrictions aligned with an Air Handler would not permit the duties of a Full Time Fueler, while the two departments were separate and Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor could not accommodate the stated restrictions. She noted Shannon had been off work starting February 20 for an indefinite period (at least until Shannon\u2019s next evaluation), and she requested an immediate status update on the claim.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 1:44 PM, Tuttle had written that Shannon\u2019s claim had involved Miss Lankswert missing days due to the injury and that UPS could not provide suitable light-duty work. Tuttle asserted that Shannon\u2019s TTD payments should be backdated to the incident date to cover the days she was unable to work, and she referenced Flaget Memorial\u2019s placement of Shannon off work for a minimum of three days (February 11\u201314, 2025). She stated that Shannon had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon and attached a Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab. Tuttle urged Liberty Mutual to initiate TTD benefits (which she indicated had been requested three times already) and warned that if the carrier refused to provide benefits required by Kentucky state law, the file should be forwarded to legal counsel to avoid further delays. She concluded by noting that Shannon\u2019s claim had already experienced a significant delay, which she found unacceptable.\n\nKaitlin Ericksen replied later on February 20, 2025, at 3:54 PM, informing Tuttle that UPS had confirmed suitable light-duty work was available, and as a result, Liberty Mutual would not be issuing TTD benefits at that time.\n\nShortly after, at approximately 5:55 PM, Tuttle pushed back in a follow-up email. She reiterated that Shannon had missed days due to the injury and that UPS could not provide suitable light-duty work. She urged that TTD payments be backdated to the incident date to cover days Shannon could not work. She stated that Flaget Memorial had placed Shannon off work for at least three days (February 11\u201314, 2025) and that Shannon had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon, attaching the same Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab. She emphasized the need to initiate TTD benefits and warned of ongoing delays if the benefits were not issued. She expressly noted that Shannon\u2019s claim had been intentionally delayed for nearly two weeks and regarded this as unacceptable.\n\nIn a broader thread dated February 25, 2025, at 11:41 AM, Sarena Tuttle again addressed Kaitlin Ericksen and attached additional certified medical records from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital. She restated that Liberty Mutual had not yet responded to their February 20 correspondence concerning TTD benefits and Form 114 reimbursements. She also revisited the Concentra records, reiterating that the wrong job description had apparently been provided to Concentra, who listed \u201cAir Handler\u201d as the job title and used the Air Handler restrictions. Tuttle asked Liberty Mutual to confirm that the correct job title in the file is indeed \u201cFull Time Fueler,\u201d emphasizing that these two job descriptions involve vastly different duties. She explained that Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor could not accommodate the restrictions, noting that Shannon had been placed off work on February 20 for an indefinite period and indicating that Shannon would be updating medical documentation with an unbiased provider later that afternoon. She pressed for an immediate update on the status of the claim and for the initiation of benefits if appropriate.\n\nThat same day, February 25, 2025, at 6:38 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen responded with a summary of Liberty Mutual\u2019s position. She stated that UPS had advised there was work available within Shannon\u2019s restrictions and, because modified work was available, TTD benefits could not be issued through February 19, 2025. Liberty Mutual planned to issue Shannon\u2019s first TTD check on February 28, 2025, with February 20, 2025 identified as the first day of TTD issued. Ericksen also indicated that a mileage reimbursement check would be requested.\n\nThroughout the exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the confidentiality and privilege notices typical of such communications, and the correspondence included the standard privacy policy notice. They also included the broader context of Shannon Lankswert\u2019s injuries, including a Tailbone Injury noted in Flaget records, and references to medical treatment strategies and accommodations being pursued by Shannon through an independent provider.\n\nIn summary, the key points across the correspondence are as follows: Shannon Lankswert\u2019s claim WC80D-H07503 faced a dispute over TTD benefits due to reports of available modified work; there was a significant discrepancy between the job title on Concentra\u2019s records (\u201cAir Handler\u201d) and the actual job title Shannon held (\u201cFull Time Fueler\u201d); Shannon had been off work since February 20 for an indefinite period, with a short initial off-work period (February 11\u201314) confirmed by Flaget Memorial; Liberty Mutual ultimately indicated that TTD benefits would not be paid for periods in which modified work was available, and that the first TTD check would be issued on February 28, 2025, with February 20, 2025 as the first day of TTD, while a mileage reimbursement check would also be requested. Shannon\u2019s counsel, through The Whaley Law Firm, continued to seek prompt initiation of TTD benefits and to clarify the correct job description in the file, citing Kentucky state law and the need to avoid further delays.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the communications in the Shannon Lankswert workers\u2019 compensation case (Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025; WC80D-H07503), as documented in the exchanged emails between The Whaley Law Firm and Liberty Mutual, and the positions taken by UPS where relevant. The Whaley Law Firm is represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, and the recipient from Liberty Mutual is Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II. The file includes references to the Certified Medical Records from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital, as well as a Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab, and discusses TTD benefits, accommodations, and potential reimbursement of expenses (Form 114). Sarena\u2019s signature in the messages notes a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky contact information.\n\nThe matter centers on whether accommodations were available for Shannon Lankswert after her work injury and whether temporary total disability (TTD) benefits should be paid. In late February 2025, questions arose about who was stating that accommodations were available, since Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor had told her there were none. The firm asserted that even if there had been incorrect guidance given to Ms. Lankswert, it was not her fault and that the situation needed to be addressed and rectified promptly; otherwise, the file should be sent to Liberty Mutual\u2019s legal department for proper resolution.\n\nOn February 20, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen advised that UPS had indicated work within Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s restrictions was available, and that modified work was ongoing. Consequently, Liberty Mutual stated they could not issue TTD benefits through February 19, 2025. They planned to issue Ms. Lankswert\u2019s first TTD check on February 28, 2025, with February 20, 2025 as the first day of TTD, and they would also request a mileage reimbursement check.\n\nEarlier in the day, on February 20, 2025, Sarena Tuttle had warned that Ms. Lankswert had missed days due to the injury and that UPS could not provide suitable light-duty work. She argued that TTD payments should be backdated to the date of the incident to cover the days Ms. Lankswert could not work. Flaget Memorial had placed Ms. Lankswert off work for at least three days (February 11\u201314, 2025), and she had been placed off work indefinitely as of that afternoon, pending her next evaluation. She attached a Work Statement from Advanced Injury Rehab and urged the initiation of TTD benefits, which she said had been requested multiple times. She cautioned that continued delays could lead to escalation to Liberty Mutual\u2019s legal counsel to avoid further delays, describing the claim as intentionally delayed for nearly two weeks.\n\nIn response, on February 20, 2025 at 3:54 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen reiterated that UPS had confirmed suitable light-duty work was available and, accordingly, Liberty Mutual would not issue TTD benefits at that time.\n\nEarlier still, at 1:44 PM on February 20, 2025, Sarena Tuttle had written that Ms. Lankswert should be compensated from the date of the incident until she was released back to full duty. She described Ms. Lankswert as a Fuel Truck Driver who must sit for long periods, lift heavy hoses, and climb stairs\u2014activities that contribute to pain and delay recovery. She asserted that Concentra had placed restrictions on Ms. Lankswert and suggested that UPS had given a standing order\u2014allegedly driven by non-medical personnel\u2014to avoid placing UPS employees off work. She explained that she could not drive due to an inability to sit for long periods and could not lift hoses; she emphasized that the restrictions from Concentra did not permit her to fulfill duties as a Full Time Fueler. The note in the chronology ends mid-sentence, indicating the message was cut off.\n\nOn February 25, 2025 at 11:41 AM, Sarena sent the email that included attachments of the Certified Medical Records from Concentra and Flaget Memorial Hospital related to Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s injuries. She noted that there had been no response to Liberty Mutual correspondence dated February 20, 2025 regarding TTD benefits and Form 114 reimbursements. After reviewing the Concentra records, she observed that the wrong job description had been provided to Concentra: they had been given \u201cAir Handler\u201d as Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s job title and had based restrictions on the Air Handler description. She asked Kaitlin to confirm that Liberty Mutual\u2019s file reflected the correct job title, \u201cFull Time Fueler,\u201d explaining that this is a substantially different role from an Air Handler who sorts packages for a short period (3\u20134 hours per shift). She noted that the two departments are distinct and reiterated that Mrs. Lankswert\u2019s immediate supervisor could not accommodate the provided restrictions, but that she had been placed off work on February 20, 2025 for an indefinite period, presumably pending the next evaluation. She requested an immediate update on the status of the claim.\n\nFollowing this, at 1:38 PM on February 25, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that UPS had advised work within the restrictions was available and that, since modified work was available, Liberty Mutual would not issue TTD benefits through February 19, 2025. She stated that the first TTD check would be issued on February 28, 2025, with February 20, 2025 as the first day of TTD, and she would also request that a mileage reimbursement check be issued.\n\nIn addition to these exchanges, prior messages in the chain emphasize the ongoing tension between the need to compensate for time off work due to the injury (TTD and Form 114 reimbursements) and the determination that suitable light-duty work could be performed within the restrictions provided by Concentra and UPS\u2019s practices. The correspondence also references the attached medical records and the discrepancy between the job descriptions used by Concentra and the actual role held by Ms. Lankswert, underscoring the need to confirm the correct job title in the file and to address the resulting discrepancies in accommodations and benefits.\n\nThis narrative reflects all facts and details contained in the structured case note: the dates of the communications (February 20 and 25, 2025), the involved parties and their roles, the references to TTD benefits and Form 114 reimbursements, the discrepancy between job titles (\u201cAir Handler\u201d vs. \u201cFull Time Fueler\u201d), the UPS standing-order assertions, the off-work status starting February 20, 2025, the attachments (Certified Medical Records, Work Statement, and a request for immediate updates), and the specific actions requested by both sides (rectifying accommodations, backdating TTD where appropriate, and issuing checks).",

Mr. Bryce Koon is the\nattorney of record for our firm, I have included his contact information\nbelow. Just to update you on the claim to date, Ms. Lankswert is a\nFull-time (8hr) Fueler for United Parcel Service, who on Friday,\nFebruary 7, 2025 fell down a set of metal stairs (photo provided) while\nwithin the scope of her employment. Ms. Lankswert immediately felt pain in\nboth elbows & her lower back from the impact on the stairs. Shortly after,\nshe was transported by another UPS Employee in their personal vehicle to\nConcentra Health on Fern Valley Road. Concentra advised Ms. Lankswert that\nthey '...are not allowed to place UPS employees off work by law, due to\ntheir account with UPS' and sent Ms. Lankswert back to full duty while\ndocumenting a limited ROM in her arms. Ms. Lankswert was off work over the\nweekend and attempted to recover at home.\n On February 11, 2025 Ms. Lankswert was still in immense pain and could\nnot await her follow up appointment with Concentra. Ms. Lankswert was seen\nat Flaget Memorial Hospital who advised Ms. Lankswert to avoid driving,\nsitting, or standing for long periods of time as well as to rest. Ms.\nLankswert then returned to Concentra on February 13, 2025, where she\nexplained to the physician that she was not able to fulfill her duties due\nto the pain & Concentra provided restrictions for Ms. Lankswert. UPS\nprovided Concentra with a job description for an 'Air Handler', not a\n'Fueler' and Concentra based their restrictions on the incorrect position\nand stated Ms. Lankswert was about to return to modified duty & work her\nfull shift. When Ms. Lankswert shared these restrictions with her immediate\nsupervisor, Amy Roy, Ms. Roy advised Ms. Lankswert that they were not able\nto accommodate her restrictions. Unfortunately, she was not scheduled to\nsee Concentra again for another 4 days, on February 17, 2025.\n From the date of her injury through February 17th, 2025, UPS made no\nmention nor took any actions to discuss workers' compensation with Ms.\nLankswert. Instead, each evening (3rd shift employee), Ms. Roy would\ncontact Ms. Lankswert & ask her how she, Ms. Lankswert, wanted her off time\nto 'coded' and given only the options of 'Call In', 'PTO' or 'Vacation'. On\nat least one occasion, Ms. Lankswert was advised the 'Board was full' and\nshe had to take a Call In Occurrence. On February 14th, Ms. Lankswert\nattempted to go in to work for her 'light duty position' and advised to sit\nin the breakroom for the evening as they had no work available for her. Ms.\nLankswert was unable to stay her whole shift as the plastic chairs & steel\nstools (photo provided) were causing more pain to her tailbone injury.\n Ms. Lankswert attended her February 17th appointment with Concentra\nand felt her injuries were not being properly addressed so she followed up\nthe next day (02.18) with Advanced Injury & Rehab who placed Ms. Lankswert\noff work until her MRI imaging results were obtained. The MRI shows at\nleast 2 bulging discs in Ms. Lankswert's lower lumbar spine and she has\nbeen ordered to physical therapy.\n To date, Ms. Lankswert still has not received any information from UPS\nin regards to her workers compensation claim. Our contact with the WC\nCarrier has been very limited and only consists of continued denial of Ms.\nLankswert's TTD benefits from the Date of her incident through February\n20th. The Adjuster is very short and only states UPS says there is\n'suitable light duty' available to Ms. Lankswert, which is in direct\ncontradiction of Ms. Lankswert's immediate supervisor. When asked who is\nstating there is suitable work, there is no response, only denial of\nbenefits.\n At this time, Ms. Lankswert has only work approximately 2 hrs (sitting\nin a breakroom) since the date of her incident. We have requested that TTD\nBenefits be issued & that her attendance status be reinstated as she should\nnot have accrued any Call Ins, used PTO and/or Vacation time in relation to\nher work related injury.

      "natural_language": "This note covers the Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 case, involving client Shannon Lankswert and the claim against United Parcel Service (UPS). On February 7, 2025, Shannon Lankswert, who works full-time (8 hours) as a Fueler for UPS, fell down a set of metal stairs in the course of her employment (photos of the incident are provided in the attached materials). She immediately experienced pain in both elbows and her lower back from the impact. She was transported by another UPS employee in the employee\u2019s personal vehicle to Concentra Health on Fern Valley Road. Concentra advised that they \u201care not allowed to place UPS employees off work by law, due to their account with UPS,\u201d and they sent Ms. Lankswert back to full duty while documenting a limited range of motion in her arms. She was off work over the weekend and attempted to recover at home.\n\nBy February 11, 2025, Ms. Lankswert was still in immense pain and could not wait for her follow-up appointment with Concentra. She was seen at Flaget Memorial Hospital, which advised her to avoid driving, sitting, or standing for long periods and to rest. She then returned to Concentra on February 13, 2025, where she explained that she could not fulfill her duties due to the pain, and Concentra provided restrictions for her. UPS had supplied Concentra with a job description for an \u201cAir Handler,\u201d not a \u201cFueler,\u201d and Concentra based their restrictions on the incorrect position, stating that Ms. Lankswert was about to return to modified duty and work her full shift. When Ms. Lankswert shared these restrictions with her immediate supervisor, Amy Roy, Ms. Roy advised that they were not able to accommodate her restrictions. She was not scheduled to see Concentra again for another four days, until February 17, 2025.\n\nFrom the date of her injury through February 17, 2025, UPS did not mention or take any action to discuss workers\u2019 compensation with Ms. Lankswert. Instead, each evening (3rd shift), Ms. Roy would contact Ms. Lankswert and ask how she wanted her off time to be coded, offering the options \u201cCall In,\u201d \u201cPTO,\u201d or \u201cVacation.\u201d On at least one occasion, Ms. Lankswert was told the \u201cBoard was full\u201d and that she had to take a Call In Occurrence. On February 14, Ms. Lankswert attempted to go to work for a \u201clight duty position\u201d but was told to sit in the breakroom for the evening because there was no work available for her. She could not stay the entire shift because the plastic chairs and steel stools (photos provided) aggravated her tailbone injury.\n\nMs. Lankswert attended her February 17 appointment with Concentra and felt that her injuries were not being properly addressed, so she followed up on February 18 with Advanced Injury & Rehab, which placed her off work until MRI results were obtained. The MRI revealed at least two bulging discs in her lower lumbar spine, and she has been ordered to physical therapy.\n\nTo date, Ms. Lankswert has not received any information from UPS regarding her workers\u2019 compensation claim. Our contact with the workers\u2019 compensation carrier has been very limited and has consisted solely of continued denial of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s temporary total disability (TTD) benefits from the date of her incident through February 20. The adjuster states that UPS says there is \u201csuitable light duty\u201d available, which contradicts what her immediate supervisor has communicated. When asked who is stating there is suitable work, there is no response, only a denial of benefits.\n\nAs of now, Ms. Lankswert has only worked approximately two hours (sitting in a breakroom) since the date of her incident. We have requested that TTD benefits be issued and that her attendance status be reinstated, as she should not have accrued any Call In, PTO, or Vacation time in relation to this work-related injury. The adjuster simply states there is suitable work available and denies benefits. We look forward to working toward an amicable resolution and hearing from you soon.\n\nContact information for counsel involved:\n- W.

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 documents the ongoing representation matter for Shannon Lankswert in her workers\u2019 compensation claim against United Parcel Service (UPS). On March 10, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel for UPS (Taylor Wood and LLucas) with Ms. Lankswert\u2019s updated Work Status Note attached. The note states that Ms. Lankswert will remain off work until her next evaluation on March 13, 2025. Tuttle requested acknowledgment of receipt and an updated status of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s claim. She also noted that, to date, there had been no response to their acknowledgment of representation or the requested documents in their letter of representation sent to Liberty Mutual on February 20, 2025. Tuttle provided her contact information and reminded recipients of her new Whaley Law Firm email address.\n\nThe March 10 email followed an earlier chain beginning February 27, 2025. In a message dated February 27, 2025, at approximately 4:06 PM, Sarena Tuttle indicated that Bryce Koon is the attorney of record for The Whaley Law Firm and provided his contact information. She updated the claim as follows: Ms. Lankswert is a full-time employee working eight hours as a Fueler for UPS. On Friday, February 7, 2025, she fell down a set of metal stairs within the scope of her employment, and immediately felt pain in both elbows and her lower back from the impact. She was transported by another UPS employee in a personal vehicle to Concentra Health on Fern Valley Road. Concentra told her they \u201care not allowed to place UPS employees off work by law, due to their account with UPS,\u201d and they sent her back to full duty while documenting a limited range of motion in her arms. She remained off work over the weekend and attempted to recover at home.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, Ms. Lankswert remained in significant pain and could not await her follow-up appointment with Concentra. She was seen at Flaget Memorial Hospital, which advised her to avoid driving, sitting, or standing for long periods and to rest. She then returned to Concentra on February 13, 2025, where she explained that she could not fulfill her duties due to pain, and Concentra issued restrictions for her. UPS provided Concentra with a job description for an \u201cAir Handler,\u201d not a \u201cFueler,\u201d and Concentra based their restrictions on this incorrect position, stating that Ms. Lankswert was about to return to modified duty and work her full shift. When Ms. Lankswert shared these restrictions with her immediate supervisor, Amy Roy, Roy advised that they could not accommodate the restrictions. She was not scheduled to see Concentra again for another four days, on February 17, 2025.\n\nFrom the date of her injury through February 17, 2025, UPS made no mention or actions to discuss workers\u2019 compensation with Ms. Lankswert. Instead, each evening (the third shift), Amy Roy would contact Ms. Lankswert and ask how she wanted her off time coded, offering only the options of \u201cCall In,\u201d \u201cPTO,\u201d or \u201cVacation.\u201d On at least one occasion, Ms. Lankswert was told the \u201cBoard was full\u201d and she had to take a Call In Occurrence. On February 14th, Ms. Lankswert attempted to go to work for a \u201clight duty position\u201d and was instructed to sit in the breakroom for the evening because there was no work available for her. She could not stay the entire shift because the plastic chairs and steel stools in the breakroom caused more pain to her tailbone injury.\n\nMs. Lankswert attended her February 17th appointment with Concentra and felt that her injuries were not being properly addressed, so she followed up on February 18, 2025, with Advanced Injury & Rehab, which placed her off work until MRI results were obtained. The MRI showed at least two bulging discs in her lower lumbar spine, and she has been ordered to physical therapy. To date, Ms. Lankswert has received no information from UPS regarding her workers\u2019 compensation claim. Communication with the workers\u2019 compensation carrier has been very limited and has consisted only of continued denial of her temporary total disability (TTD) benefits from the date of her incident through February 20, 2025. The adjuster conveyed, in a curt manner, that UPS says there is \u201csuitable light duty\u201d available for Ms. Lankswert, which contradicts the position of her immediate supervisor. When asked who was stating there is suitable work, there was no response beyond denial of benefits. As of the report, Ms. Lankswert has only worked approximately two hours (sitting in a breakroom) since the date of her incident. The firm has requested that TTD benefits be issued and that her attendance status be reinstated, noting that she should not have accrued any Call In, PTO, or Vacation time related to her work-related injury. The adjuster\u2019s position remains that there is suitable work available and that benefits should be denied. The Whaley Law Firm indicates a desire to work toward an amicable resolution and anticipates a prompt response from the opposing counsel.\n\nIn addition to the narrative of the claim, the February 27, 2025 email includes the signatories and contact details for the parties: W. Bryce Koon, reachable at (502) 583-4022, Ext. 114, Bryce@WhaleyLawFirm.com; and Sarena M. Tuttle, reachable at (502) 357-9971 (D) and (502) 583-4022, Ext. 104, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with the notice to use the new email address. The email also lists three attachments: 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Doctor Notes.pdf; 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Injury Photos - Both Arms & Tail Bone Bruising.pdf; and 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Text w Supervisor - Screenshots.pdf.\n\nAlso on February 27, 2025, Taylor Wood of Lucas & Dietz, PLLC sent a separate email confirming that a letter of representation had been attached regarding the above-referenced claim. Wood noted that Lance Lucas would handle the claim unless hard copies were requested to be mailed. The message, which included Taylor Wood\u2019s contact information and a standard confidentiality disclaimer, closed with guidance that hard copies would not be mailed unless requested.\n\nIn summary, the records depict a significant early injury on February 7, 2025, with subsequent missteps in medical\u2013legal handling, incorrect job descriptions used to justify restrictions, a lack of timely benefit payments or case discussions from the carrier, ongoing denial of TTD benefits, and an extended period of limited or no meaningful work for Ms. Lankswert, all accompanied by repeated requests for acknowledgment, representation, and documentation from the defense team and their client. The notes also show ongoing communications through March 2025, including updated work status and documentation intended to support ongoing disability and compensation claims.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert. Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert.\n\nIn late February 2025, communications were exchanged regarding Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, WC80D-H07503. Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual Insurance identified herself as the adjuster assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s claim in a message sent on February 20, 2025. In that note, Kaitlin stated: Good morning, I am the adjuster who has been assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers compensation claim. Please let me know if you need anything. The message carries the Liberty Mutual contact details: Kaitlin Ericksen, Claims Specialist II, Workers' Compensation Claims, Liberty Mutual Insurance, Indianapolis, IN, Office: 317-483-8037, Fax: 603-422-6845. The mailing address listed is P.O. Box 7170, Indianapolis, IN 46207.\n\nLater that same day, the Whaley Law Firm, on behalf of Shannon Lankswert, replied. At approximately 11:16 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent a response to Kaitlin Ericksen along with several attachments. The firm\u2019s message included their office\u2019s letter of representation and the Kentucky Department of Workers Claims (KY DWC) forms 106 and 113, as well as KY DWC Form 114 for the related claim. They also provided injury photos and scene photos for the file. The firm advised that Shannon Lankswert has an appointment that afternoon at 2:00 PM with Advanced Injury Rehab for further evaluation of her injuries. They noted that UPS had delayed processing this claim and that Shannon\u2019s immediate supervisor had advised that they could not accommodate the restrictions set by Concentra. Despite these restrictions, Shannon was still required to drive more than 35 miles to the property and to sit in a breakroom for the evening. Because of her injuries, she had been advised not to drive for long periods and she could not sit in the chairs provided (photos were included). As a result, Shannon was forced to use vacation time and received occurrences for the missed time. The firm urged that TTD (Temporary Total Disability) benefits begin processing as soon as possible and asked that Shannon\u2019s vacation time and Attendance Status be reinstated promptly to avoid future issues. They emphasized that Shannon Lankswert should not have accrued any occurrences or been punished for her work-related injury. The message closed with an invitation for questions and a commitment to work toward an amicable resolution. The attachments referenced were the representation letter and the KY DWC forms (106, 113, 114) along with the injury and scene photos.\n\nThat same February 20, 2025 thread also included a forwarding of the prior communications. The forwarded message from The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena Tuttle to Kaitlin Ericksen (Cc: Bryce Koon) reiterated the contents described above: the office\u2019s letter of representation, the KY DWC Form 106, 113, and 114, and the related photos, plus the note about Shannon\u2019s 2:00 PM appointment and the ongoing issues with processing by UPS, the restrictions by Concentra, and Shannon\u2019s travel and seating hardships. The message again stressed the need to begin processing Shannon\u2019s TTD benefits and to reinstate her vacation time and Attendance Status to prevent future problems, asserting that Shannon should not have incurred any negative occurrences due to her work-related injury.\n\nAlso on February 20, 2025, the original message from Kaitlin Ericksen (sent at about 10:36 AM) stated: Good morning, I am the adjuster who has been assigned to Shannon Lankswert\u2019s workers compensation claim. Please let me know if you need anything. This established the initial point of contact for the claim.\n\nThe case file also includes the standard confidentiality notice typical of Liberty Mutual emails, indicating that the information contained in the email and any attachments is confidential and may be privileged or constitute attorney work product. It instructs unintended recipients to notify the sender, refrain from using or distributing the information, and destroy all copies; it also notes that a privacy notice is available on Liberty Mutual\u2019s privacy policy website. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s communications also include contact details and note a new email address for Sarena M. Tuttle: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm\u2019s Louisville office address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone numbers: D (502) 357-9971 and O (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nIn addition to these February 2025 exchanges, on March 7, 2025, Shannon Lankswert\u2019s contact, Shannon Mattingly (smm75mj@msn.com), replied to the Whaley Law Firm regarding WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert. The message, with the subject Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert, was sent from Shannon Mattingly to Sarena Tuttle at 21:45:59 UTC, indicating ongoing communications between Shannon and the firm regarding the case. The original email lines show the correspondence was prepared for review on iOS, as indicated by the standard Outlook for iOS signature, and the firm\u2019s representative details were included in the message thread.\n\nThis series of exchanges documents the assignment of a new adjuster, the office\u2019s representation, the forms filed (KY DWC Forms 106, 113, 114), patient appointment scheduling, transport and seating constraints tied to Shannon\u2019s injuries, the impact on her work time (vacation use and occurrences), the request to commence TTD benefits, and the firm\u2019s guidance to coordinate with the office rather than direct contact with the adjuster. It also records the client\u2019s and the firm\u2019s ongoing efforts to secure an amicable resolution and to ensure Shannon is not unfairly penalized for injury-related absence, while preserving all relevant dates, forms, photos, and contact information from the communications.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025\nClient: Shannon Lankswert\n\nIn the matter of Shannon Lankswert v UPS, the Whaley Law Firm represented Shannon Lankswert. The Whaley Law Firm initially reached out to Lucas & Dietz, PLLC, in mid-February 2025 to formalize representation and to forward requested documents to the defense and the workers\u2019 compensation carrier. On February 27, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent a detailed communication describing Shannon Lankswert\u2019s claim history and the status of communications with UPS and the carrier, and attached material related to the claim. The February 27 communication also noted that Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm is the attorney of record and included contact information for both Mr. Koon and Ms. Tuttle.\n\nOn March 14, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle again wrote to Taylor Wood and Mr. Lucas, with Bryce Koon copied, to express concern that more than two weeks had passed since the representation letter had been received and acknowledged, and to note that no documents had yet been received despite the request having been made more than six weeks prior. The email asked to confirm that Lucas & Dietz continues to serve as Shannon Lankswert\u2019s legal counsel and to immediately forward the documents that had been requested. The message emphasized an interest in an amicable resolution but stated that the ongoing delays were discouraging and urged contact to discuss the claim promptly. The message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm\u2019s Louisville, Kentucky address and direct lines, and noting a new email address for contact.\n\nEarlier, on March 10, 2025, at approximately 10:16 AM (the timestamp appears as 10:16? AM in the chain), Ms. Tuttle sent another note stating that Shannon Lankswert\u2019s work status update had been attached, indicating that Ms. Lankswert would remain off work until her next evaluation on March 13, 2025. The message asked the recipients to acknowledge receipt and provide an updated status of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s claim. It also highlighted that to date the firm had not received any response to their acknowledgement of representation nor any of the requested documents in their February 20, 2025 letter to Liberty Mutual.\n\nThe February 27, 2025 communications from The Whaley Law Firm provided a detailed narrative of the claim. In that correspondence, it was stated that Shannon Lankswert is a full-time (8-hour) Fueler for United Parcel Service. On Friday, February 7, 2025, she fell down a set of metal stairs within the scope of her employment, and immediately experienced pain in both elbows and her lower back from the impact. She was transported by another UPS employee in that employee\u2019s personal vehicle to Concentra Health on Fern Valley Road. Concentra advised that they are not allowed to place UPS employees off work by law due to their account with UPS, and they sent Ms. Lankswert back to full duty while documenting a limited range of motion (ROM) in her arms. She remained off work over the weekend and attempted to recover at home.\n\nOn February 11, 2025, Ms. Lankswert was still in substantial pain and could not wait for her follow-up appointment with Concentra. She was seen at Flaget Memorial Hospital, where she was advised to avoid driving, sitting, or standing for long periods and to rest. She returned to Concentra on February 13, 2025, where she explained that she could not fulfill her duties due to the pain, and Concentra provided restrictions for Ms. Lankswert. UPS had provided Concentra with a job description for an \u201cAir Handler,\u201d not a \u201cFueler,\u201d and Concentra based their restrictions on the incorrect position, stating that Ms. Lankswert was about to return to modified duty and work her full shift. When Ms. Lankswert shared these restrictions with her immediate supervisor, Amy Roy, Ms. Roy advised that they could not accommodate the restrictions. She was not scheduled to see Concentra again for another four days, on February 17, 2025.\n\nFrom the date of her injury through February 17, 2025, UPS did not mention or take any action to discuss workers\u2019 compensation with Ms. Lankswert. Instead, each evening, Ms. Roy, a third-shift employee, would contact Ms. Lankswert and ask how she wanted her off time coded, offering only the options of \u201cCall In,\u201d \u201cPTO,\u201d or \u201cVacation.\u201d On February 14, 2025, Ms. Lankswert attempted to go to work for a light-duty position and was told to sit in the breakroom for the evening since there was no work available. She was unable to stay for her entire shift because the plastic chairs and steel stools caused additional pain to her tailbone injury, as evidenced by accompanying photos.\n\nMs. Lankswert attended her February 17, 2025, appointment with Concentra and felt that her injuries were not being properly addressed, leading her to follow up on February 18, 2025, with Advanced Injury & Rehab, which placed her off work until MRI results were obtained. The MRI revealed at least two bulging discs in her lower lumbar spine, and she was ordered to physical therapy. To date, Shannon Lankswert has not received any information from UPS regarding her workers\u2019 compensation claim. The Whaley Law Firm reported that contact with the workers\u2019 compensation carrier had been very limited and that the only communication was a continued denial of temporary total disability (TTD) benefits from the date of the incident through February 20, 2025. The adjuster reportedly stated that there is \u201csuitable light duty\u201d available for Ms. Lankswert, which contradicted her immediate supervisor. When asked who indicated there was suitable work, there was no response other than continued denial of benefits. By that time, Ms. Lankswert had only worked approximately two hours since the date of her incident, consisting of time spent sitting in a breakroom. The firm requested that TTD benefits be issued and her attendance status reinstated, noting that she should not have accrued any \u201cCall Ins,\u201d PTO, or Vacation time related to her work-related injury. The adjuster\u2019s stance remained that there was suitable work available and that benefits should be denied. The Whaley Law Firm expressed their intent to work toward an amicable resolution and looked forward to hearing from the defense promptly.\n\nAccompanying the February 27, 2025 correspondence were several documents: 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Doctor Notes.pdf; 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Injury Photos - Both Arms & Tail Bone Bruising.pdf; and 2025.02.17 Lankswert CPD Text w Supervisor - Screenshots.pdf.\n\nAdditionally, on February 27, 2025 at approximately 2:43 PM, Taylor Wood of LUCAS & DIETZ, PLLC replied with a message Good afternoon, noting that a letter of representation had been attached regarding the above-referenced claim and that Lance Lucas would be handling the claim unless hard copies were requested to be mailed. The message included professional courtesy and contact details for Taylor Wood, Paralegal at LUCAS & DIETZ, PLLC, including the Florence, Kentucky office address and phone numbers.\n\nShortly after, at approximately 4:06 PM on February 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent the detailed representation letter (the extensive narrative above), reiterating Shannon Lankswert\u2019s status, the medical timeline, and the ongoing issues with the claim, UPS response (or lack thereof), and the workers\u2019 compensation process. The email also listed the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s and Ms. Tuttle\u2019s contact information and included a note about the attachments.\n\nThis email chain further included a note indicating that the body of the message was intended to be confidential and protected by attorney-client or other applicable privileges, and that the information was non-public and trade secrets, intended only for the recipient(s).\n\nIn summary, the record contains a sequence of communications beginning with the February 27, 2025 representation and claim history disclosure from The Whaley Law Firm, followed by a February 27, 2025 response from LUCAS & DIETZ confirming representation and assigning Lance Lucas, then updated communications in March 2025 documenting Shannon Lankswert\u2019s continued off-work status, her medical findings (including MRI showing at least two bulging discs in the lower lumbar spine and a prescription for physical therapy), limited or denied benefits from the workers\u2019 compensation carrier, ongoing questions about the availability of suitable light duty versus the supervisor\u2019s guidance, and the firm\u2019s pursuit of an amicable resolution along with delivery of supporting documents and medical files. The communications emphasize the lack of timely responses to the representation letters (noted as sent February 20, 2025 to Liberty Mutual) and the ongoing difficulties Shannon Lankswert faced in obtaining information and benefits related to her claim.",

Please continue her TTD benefits and provide\nan update on the past due TTD Benefits from the start of the claims\nprocess.\n Further, we have received and reviewed the First Report Of Injury\n(FROI) from yesterday's discussion and see there are several discrepancies\nnoted in the report. Beginning with her Pay Information, it is noted that\nshe is paid $999.99 a week, 3 days a week, and her salary did continue.\nMrs. Lankswert is a full time employee who works 5 days a week and her\nsalary did not continue, she was forced to use PTO & Vacation Time. 2nd,\nher injuries are listed as a contusion on her elbow. There is no mention of\nher back injury and the bulging disc that resulted from her fall. 3rd, the\nDescription of the incident, the report indicates she slipped on the 3rd of\n4 steps, however, our understanding is that she slipped on the top step &\nhit 3 steps on her way down. We are aware there are cameras covering this\nspecific area & have requested the surveillance footage from that time of\nthe incident with no response or acknowledgement from the Adjuster and or\nyour office. 4th, the report indicates \"No Lost Time\", as discussed Ms.\nLankswert has not returned to work due to her injuries and has now missed\n26 work days with the exception of 2 hours she was forced to sit in the\nbreakroom until she could be properly evaluated by an unbiased medical\nprovider. Lastly, the report indicates \"No Medical Treatment\" under Initial\nTreatment. Ms. Lankswert was immediately transported by her management team\nto Concentra the same night of the incident.\n All of these items definitely make this incident seem very minor in\ncontrast to the reality of the situation and severity of Ms. Lankswert's\ninjuries. We have attached KAR 803.025.240 for your review & reference,\nspecifically highlighting Section 3, 4, 5, 6 & 7, all of which seem to be\nin question in relation to this claim and the unfair claims practices that\nare clearly evident in this file. At this time, we again request the\nfollowing as outlined in our initial letter of representation dated\nFebruary 20th, 2025:\n\nPursuant to Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8), *please furnish an updated\nand complete copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file within fifteen days of\nthis notice.

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert. This note concerns the file WC80D-H07503 for Shannon Lankswert and documents communications dated March 18, 2025, among The Whaley Law Firm and Liberty Mutual claims personnel, with Lance Lucas and Taylor Wood also copied, and Bryce Koon CC\u2019d. The message was sent by Sarena Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn a March 18, 2025 communication, The Whaley Law Firm advised that they had spoken with Ms. Lankswert\u2019s provider moments earlier and that the provider continues to keep Ms. Lankswert off work through March 27, 2025, at which time she will be re-evaluated. The firm asked Liberty Mutual to continue Ms. Lankswert\u2019s temporary total disability (TTD) benefits and to provide an update on the past-due TTD benefits from the start of the claim. They additionally stated that they had received and reviewed the First Report Of Injury (FROI) discussed the previous day and identified several discrepancies within the report.\n\nRegarding pay information in the FROI, the report reportedly shows Ms. Lankswert is paid $999.99 per week for three days of work, and that her salary continued. The firm clarified that Ms. Lankswert is a full-time employee who works five days per week, and that her salary did not continue; she was instead required to use paid time off (PTO) and vacation time. The second discrepancy concerns the injuries listed: the FROI lists a contusion on her elbow, with no mention of a back injury or the bulging disc that resulted from her fall. The third discrepancy concerns the incident description: the report states she slipped on the third of four steps, whereas the firm\u2019s understanding is that she slipped on the top step and struck three steps on her way down. The firm noted cameras cover the area and stated they had requested the surveillance footage from the time of the incident, but had not received a response or acknowledgment from the adjuster or Liberty Mutual. The fourth issue concerns \u201cNo Lost Time\u201d in the FROI; in contrast, the firm stated that Ms. Lankswert has not returned to work due to injuries and has missed 26 workdays, with the exception of two hours she was required to sit in the breakroom until she could be properly evaluated by an unbiased medical provider. The final discrepancy noted is that the FROI indicates \u201cNo Medical Treatment\u201d under Initial Treatment, while Ms. Lankswert was immediately transported by her management team to Concentra on the night of the incident.\n\nThe Whaley Law Firm asserted that these items strongly imply the incident is far more serious than a minor event would suggest. They attached KAR 803.025.240 for review, specifically highlighting Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which they stated appear to be in question regarding the claim and the unfair claims practices they alleged are evident in the file. They reiterated their demand, consistent with their initial letter of representation dated February 20, 2025, for an updated and complete copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file within fifteen days of the notice, pursuant to Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8). The request was to include, but not be limited to, the following items: (1) medical records; (2) pre-employment physicals, screenings, and urinalysis; (3) average weekly wage documentation, including one year of wage records preceding the injury; (4) temporary total disability ledger; (5) job description; (6) incident/OSHA reports and the First Report of Injury; (7) any photographs, video footage, or recorded statements; and (8) any and all lien information for at-fault third parties.\n\nThe message was signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with contact details: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noting a new email address. The note also bore the standard request to acknowledge receipt and the confidentiality notice.\n\nIn a subsequent exchange on March 18, 2025, around 11:09 a.m. (time noted as tentative), Sarena Tuttle informed Kaitlin that, with legal counsel involved, all correspondence should be routed through the law office, and that they had forwarded the last off-work statement they had received to Mr. Lucas. They stated they had reached out to Ms. Lankswert and her provider for an update since her appointment at the end of the previous week and were awaiting a response.\n\nKaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual replied around 9:30 a.m. on the same day, stating that she had been unable to release Ms. Lankswert\u2019s most recent TTD check because Liberty Mutual had not yet received an updated work note or medical records from the appointment on March 7, 2025, and requested a copy of the work note from that appointment.\n\nThe overall narrative reflects that, as of March 18, 2025, the parties were engaged in ongoing communications regarding the extent of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s injuries, the accuracy of the FROI, the computation and continuation of TTD benefits, and the production of the claim file and supporting documentation, in the context of a representation by The Whaley Law Firm and the involvement of legal counsel.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 concerns client Shannon Lankswert. In the updated case communications, The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, sent a message on March 26, 2025, addressed to Mr. Lance Lucas and Taylor Wood with Bryce Koon and Kaitlin Ericksen CC\u2019d. The subject was Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert. The email attached an updated Work Status showing Ms. Lankswert\u2019s off-work status continuing through April 9, 2025. Tuttle noted that, to date, none of the requested documents had been received for 60+ days, with the only exception being the First Report of Injury, which contained several inaccuracies. To avoid further delays or potential litigation, she asked that the requested documents be forwarded promptly for review. Specifically, she requested Ms. Lankswert\u2019s Average Weekly Wage (AWW) calculation and supporting documentation, her formal job description, an up-to-date Temporary Total Disability (TTD) ledger and Indemnity ledgers, and the surveillance footage for the area where Ms. Lankswert was injured. The message included Tuttle\u2019s contact details, the Whaley Law Firm address in Louisville, KY, and noted her new email address.\n\nThe record also contains earlier exchanges from March 18, 2025. In a 2:30 p.m. message, Sarena Tuttle informed the recipients that Ms. Lankswert\u2019s provider had advised she would remain off work until March 27, 2025, at which time she would be reevaluated. Tuttle requested that TTD benefits continue and asked for an update on past-due TTD benefits since the start of the claim. She indicated they had reviewed the First Report Of Injury (FROI) from the prior discussion and identified several discrepancies. Specifically, the pay information in the FROI stated that Ms. Lankswert earned $999.99 per week for three days a week, and that her salary had continued; however, Ms. Lankswert is a full-time employee who works five days a week, and her salary did not continue, as she had to use PTO and vacation time. The FROI listed a contusion to the elbow, with no mention of a back injury or bulging disc resulting from the fall. The incident description suggested she slipped on the third of four steps, whereas there was an understanding that she slipped on the top step and hit three steps on the way down. Tuttle noted there are cameras covering the area and requested surveillance footage from the time of the incident, but had not received a response from the adjuster or the office. The FROI also stated \u201cNo Lost Time,\u201d but Ms. Lankswert had not returned to work due to injuries and had missed 26 workdays, with the exception of two hours she spent in the breakroom awaiting proper evaluation by an unbiased medical provider. The FROI also indicated \u201cNo Medical Treatment\u201d under Initial Treatment, yet Ms. Lankswert was transported by management to Concentra the night of the incident. Tuttle stated that these items made the incident appear minor compared to the reality of her injuries. She attached KAR 803.025.240 for review, specifically highlighting Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which she asserted were in question regarding the claim and the alleged unfair claims practices.\n\nIn the same March 18 exchange, Tuttle reiterated a request, under Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8), that the other party furnish an updated and complete copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file within fifteen days, including but not limited to: medical records; pre-employment physicals, screenings, and urinalysis; average weekly wage documentation covering one year prior to the injury; a temporary total disability ledger; the job description; incident or OSHA reports, the First Report of Injury, and any photographs, video footage, or recorded statements; and any lien information for at-fault third parties. The message again provided Tuttle\u2019s contact information and urged cooperation.\n\nAlso on March 18, in a separate note, Sarena Tuttle addressed Kaitlin Ericksen directly, explaining that now that legal counsel was involved, all correspondence should go through counsel. The firm stated that the last off-work statement they had received had been forwarded to Mr. Lucas, and that they had contacted Ms. Lankswert and her provider for an update since the appointment at the end of the previous week, awaiting her response.\n\nIn a reply dated March 18, 2025 at 9:30 a.m., Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual indicated she could not release Ms. Lankswert\u2019s most recent TTD check because an updated work note or medical records from the 3/7/25 appointment had not been received. She asked for a copy of the work note from that appointment.\n\nThe correspondence included standard confidentiality language from Kaitlin\u2019s message, noting that the information in the email and any attachments is confidential and may be privileged or attorney work product, with instructions to notify the sender if not the intended recipient and to destroy copies if inappropriate.\n\nIn sum, the case file for Shannon Lankswert includes multiple timely communications between The Whaley Law Firm and Liberty Mutual regarding off-work status, discrepancies in the First Report of Injury, requests for updated medical documentation and wage information, surveillance footage, and procedural steps under applicable Kentucky rules, all aimed at moving the claim toward resolution while ensuring Ms. Lankswert\u2019s rights are protected.",

Please continue her TTD benefits and provide an update on the past due TTD Benefits from the start of the claims process.\n Further, we have received and reviewed the First Report Of Injury (FROI) from yesterday's discussion and see there are several discrepancies noted in the report. Beginning with her Pay Information, it is noted that she is paid $999.99 a week, 3 days a week, and her salary did continue. Mrs. Lankswert is a full time employee who works 5 days a week and her salary did not continue, she was forced to use PTO & Vacation Time. 2nd, her injuries are listed as a contusion on her elbow. There is no mention of her back injury and the bulging disc that resulted from her fall. 3rd, the Description of the incident, the report indicates she slipped on the 3rd of 4 steps, however, our understanding is that she slipped on the top step & hit 3 steps on her way down. We are aware there are cameras covering this specific area & have requested the surveillance footage from that time of the incident with no response or acknowledgement from the Adjuster and or your office. 4th, the report indicates \"No Lost Time\", as discussed Ms. Lankswert has not returned to work due to her injuries and has now missed 26 work days with the exception of 2 hours she was forced to sit in the breakroom until she could be properly evaluated by an unbiased medical provider. Lastly, the report indicates \"No Medical Treatment\" under Initial Treatment. Ms. Lankswert was immediately transported by her management team to Concentra the same night of the incident.\n All of these items definitely make this incident seem very minor in contrast to the reality of the situation and severity of Ms. Lankswert's injuries.

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025. Client: Shannon Lankswert.\n\nIn the WC80D-H07503 matter for Shannon Lankswert, an email from Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II with Liberty Mutual Claims, was sent on March 26, 2025. In the message, she advised good afternoon and stated that the attached AWW-1 and TTD log were included, and that there is no surveillance footage available. She also noted that the information in the message and attachments is confidential and may be privileged or constitute attorney work product, and provided the standard instructions for unintended recipients, including notification, no dissemination, destruction, and a privacy notice link.\n\nEarlier that same day, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm sent a response to Lance Lucas and Taylor Wood, with Bryce Koon cc\u2019d, regarding the updated Work Status for Ms. Lankswert. She reported that Ms. Lankswert\u2019s off-work status was being continued through April 9, 2025. She also stated that, to date, the firm had not received any of the requested documents that had been sought for 60+ days, with the sole exception being the First Report of Injury (FROI), which she described as being riddled with incorrect information. To avoid further delays or litigation, she requested that Liberty Mutual forward the requested documents as soon as possible for their review. Specifically, she asked that Liberty Mutual include Ms. Lankswert\u2019s AWW Calculation and supporting documentation, her formal job description, an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers, and surveillance footage for the area where Ms. Lankswert was injured.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, at 2:30 PM (the timestamp shows a question mark in the record for the time), Sarena Tuttle wrote that, with legal counsel now involved, all correspondence should go through their office. She noted that they had forwarded the last off-work statement they received to Mr. Lucas, and that they had reached out to Ms. Lankswert and her provider for an update since her appointment at the end of last week and were awaiting her response.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 9:30 AM, Kaitlin Ericksen asked for a copy of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s work note from a 3/7/25 appointment, explaining that she had been unable to release the most recent TTD check because Liberty Mutual had not yet received an updated work note or medical records from that appointment.\n\nIn addition, on March 18, 2025 at 11:09 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent another message to Kaitlin. She reiterated that with legal counsel involved, all correspondence should go through the law office, and she confirmed that they had forwarded the last off-work statement to Mr. Lucas and had reached out to Ms. Lankswert and her provider for an update since the appointment at the end of last week, and were awaiting a response.\n\nSeparately, in the March 18 communications, Sarena and Kaitlin discussed the First Report of Injury (FROI) and related concerns. In the March 18, 2025, 2:30 PM exchange, the parties referenced that the FROI contained discrepancies, including pay information indicating $999.99 per week for three days per week while Ms. Lankswert is a full-time employee who works five days a week and did not receive salary continuation, instead using PTO and Vacation Time. There was also a discrepancy regarding back injury and a bulging disc, as the FROI only listed a contusion to the elbow and did not mention a back injury. Regarding the incident description, the FROI stated that she slipped on the third of four steps, whereas the understanding was that she slipped on the top step and hit three steps on the way down. The firm noted knowledge of cameras covering the area and had requested surveillance footage from the time of the incident, with no response or acknowledgment from the Adjuster or Liberty Mutual\u2019s office. The FROI indicated \u201cNo Lost Time,\u201d but the firm advised that Ms. Lankswert had not returned to work due to her injuries and had missed 26 work days, with the exception of two hours she was in the breakroom awaiting proper evaluation by an unbiased medical provider. The FROI also stated \u201cNo Medical Treatment\u201d under Initial Treatment, whereas Ms. Lankswert was reportedly transported by management to Concentra on the night of the incident. The Whaley Law Firm attached KAR 803.025.240 for review, highlighting Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which they contended were in question regarding the claim and what they described as unfair claims practices. They reiterated a request from their initial letter of representation dated February 20, 2025, for the following within fifteen days, pursuant to Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8): a complete and updated copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file, including (1) medical records; (2) pre-employment physicals, screenings, and urinalysis; (3) average weekly wage documentation, including one year of wage records preceding the injury; (4) temporary total disability ledger; (5) job description; (6) incident/OSHA reports, First Report of Injury; (7) photographs, video footage, or recorded statements; and (8) any and all lien information for at-fault third parties.\n\nIn that same March 18, 2025 correspondence, Sarena Tuttle attached a note that she had previously informed Kaitlin that, now that legal counsel is involved, all correspondence should go through THE Whaley Law Firm, and that they forwarded the last off-work statement to Mr. Lucas and were awaiting updates from Ms. Lankswert and her provider.\n\nEarlier still, at 11:09 AM on March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle sent a separate message to Kaitlin reiterating that, with the involvement of legal counsel, all correspondence should go through the law office, and acknowledging that they had forwarded the last off-work statement to Mr. Lucas and were awaiting an update from Ms. Lankswert and her provider since the end of the prior week.\n\nFinally, at 9:30 AM on March 18, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen had written that she could not release Ms. Lankswert\u2019s most recent TTD check because she had not yet received an updated work note or medical records from the 3/7/25 appointment and asked for a copy of the work note from that appointment.\n\nThis sequence of communications reflects ongoing off-work status and benefits issues for Shannon Lankswert, ongoing requests for documentation and surveillance footage, and the transition of correspondence through legal counsel, with multiple discrepancies identified between the FROI and the actual facts of the incident and employment status.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025 concerns Shannon Lankswert in a workers\u2019 compensation matter (WC80D-H07503). The file shows a chain of communications beginning with ongoing efforts between The Whaley Law Firm and Liberty Mutual, with the most recent communication titled \u201cRe: Re: WC80D-H07503 Shannon Lankswert.\u201d\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual, with Lance Lucas and Taylor Wood cc\u2019d, and Bryce Koon also copied. In that message, Tuttle indicated she had reviewed the attached Temporary Total Disability (TTD) Ledger and identified discrepancies. By Liberty Mutual\u2019s figures, Ms. Lankswert is owed a total of $9,070.65, yet payments issued amount to $6,047.06 and Ms. Lankswert has received only $4,031.40. She noted that the last payment of $1,007.85 may be en route for the period 03/25\u201303/31 and requested the status of the missing payments. Tuttle also asked for clarification as to why Ms. Lankswert is not receiving the State Maximum, given that all four quarters exceeded the Kentucky 2025 maximum of $1,231.22, and inquired whether taxes were being withheld. The email closed with Tuttle\u2019s contact information and a note to use her new email address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on March 26, 2025, at approximately 1:31 PM, Tuttle wrote Mr. Lucas explaining that, as a Workers\u2019 Compensation Adjuster, Kaitlin Ericksen would not have the requested footage and that the request for footage should be directed to Mr. Lucas as Counsel who could obtain it.\n\nAt approximately 1:25 PM on March 26, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen replied, stating that she had attached an AWW-1 and a TTD log and that Liberty Mutual did not have any surveillance footage.\n\nEarlier still, on March 26, 2025, at 12:07 PM, Tuttle wrote to Mr. Lucas. She attached the updated Work Status for Ms. Lankswert, which continued her off-work status through April 9, 2025. She emphasized that, to date, Liberty Mutual had not provided any of the requested documents that had been requested for more than 60 days, with the only exception being the First Report of Injury (FROI), which she described as containing incorrect information. To avoid further delays or litigation, she requested that the following documents be forwarded promptly for review: Ms. Lankswert\u2019s AWW calculation and supporting documentation, her formal job description, an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers, and the surveillance footage for the area where she was injured.\n\nThe chronology also includes an earlier email from March 18, 2025, at 2:30 PM. In that message, Tuttle informed colleagues that they had spoken with Ms. Lankswert\u2019s provider, who reported that she would remain off work until March 27, 2025, at which point she would be re-evaluated. Liberty Mutual was asked to continue her TTD benefits and to provide an update on past-due TTD benefits from the start of the claim process. Tuttle and her team reviewed the FROI from the prior day and noted several discrepancies: pay information indicated pay of $999.99 per week for three days, while Ms. Lankswert, a full-time employee working five days per week, did not continue her salary and had to use PTO and vacation time. The FROI also listed her injuries as a contusion to the elbow, with no mention of a back injury or bulging disc resulting from the fall. The incident description claimed she slipped on the third of four steps, but Liberty Mutual\u2019s understanding was that she slipped on the top step and struck three steps on the way down. Tuttle noted that cameras cover the area and requested the surveillance footage, but had not received a response. She also observed that the FROI stated \u201cNo Lost Time,\u201d yet Ms. Lankswert had not returned to work, having missed 26 work days (with the exception of two hours she spent in a break room awaiting proper evaluation by an unbiased medical provider). The FROI also stated \u201cNo Medical Treatment\u201d under Initial Treatment, whereas Ms. Lankswert was transported to Concentra the night of the incident.\n\nTuttle stated that these items suggested the incident appeared minor in contrast to the reality of Ms. Lankswert\u2019s injuries. The email referenced KAR 803.025.240 and highlighted Sections 3 through 7, asserting these sections were at issue regarding unfair claims practices. She reiterated a request, per their initial letter of representation dated February 20, 2025, under Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8), for an updated and complete copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file within fifteen days, including but not limited to: medical records; pre-employment physicals and screenings; one year of wage records showing average weekly wage documentation; a Temporary Total Disability ledger; a job description; incident and OSHA reports, including the First Report of Injury; any photographs, video footage, or recorded statements; and any lien information for an at-fault third party.\n\nThe chain of communications also shows the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s continued efforts to obtain complete documentation and evidence, including the surveillance footage for the incident area and the comprehensive documentation requested to support the claim. The record ends with the March 26 thread and the March 27 summary email, together with the associated attachments and contact details for the parties involved.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025\nClient: Shannon Lankswert\n\nIn late March 2025, The Whaley Law Firm, representing Shannon Lankswert in the WC80D-H07503 claim, circulated a series of internal and external emails addressing disputed wage and benefit calculations, missing documents, and the husbanding of surveillance footage related to Ms. Lankswert\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim. The correspondence involved Ms. Lankswert\u2019s attorney and representatives from Liberty Mutual, with participation from Mr. Lucas, Ms. Wood, and Mr. Koon, among others, and included notices about updated work status, requested disclosures, and disputes over payments and calculations.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, informed colleagues that Ms. Lankswert\u2019s treating provider had not cleared her to return to work and would keep her off work through March 27, 2025, at which time she would be re-evaluated. The firm asked that TTD benefits continue and requested an update on past-due TTD benefits from the start of the claim process. They noted several discrepancies in the First Report of Injury (FROI) discussed in a recent meeting and asked for corrective action. Specifically, they described: pay information stating $999.99 per week for three days a week despite Ms. Lankswert being a full-time employee (five days per week) whose salary did not continue and who used PTO and vacation time; the FROI listing of elbow contusion without mention of a back injury or bulging disc resulting from the fall; an incident description that indicated she slipped on the third of four steps, whereas the team understood she slipped on the top step and then slid down three steps; the existence of cameras covering the incident area and a request for surveillance footage with no response; a notation of \u201cNo Lost Time,\u201d despite Ms. Lankswert not returning to work due to injuries and having missed 26 workdays, with only two hours spent in the breakroom awaiting proper evaluation by an unbiased medical provider; and a note of \u201cNo Medical Treatment\u201d under Initial Treatment despite Ms. Lankswert being transported to Concentra the night of the incident. The firm stated these items cast the incident as far less serious than it actually was and attached KAR 803.025.240 for review, highlighting sections 3 through 7, which they believed reflected unfair claims practices. They also referenced Civil Rule 26 and 803 KAR 25:010(8) and requested an updated and complete copy of the injured worker\u2019s claim file within fifteen days of the date of their correspondence, noting the incomplete status of the file at that time.\n\nEarlier that same day, March 18, 2025, Sarena also addressed the issue of surveillance footage, noting that as a workers\u2019 compensation adjuster, Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual would not have the footage and that the request for footage should be directed to Mr. Lucas as Counsel who could obtain it. The message was circulated to relevant parties, including Lance Lucas, Taylor Wood, and others, with reference to the need for surveillance video from the area where the injury occurred.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen, a Liberty Mutual claims specialist, replied that she did not have any surveillance footage and attached AWW-1 and the TTD log for the claim, indicating that there was no footage available.\n\nLater on March 26, Sarena Tuttle sent another message to Mr. Lucas and Ms. Wood, with Mr. Koon copied, stating that she had attached the updated Work Status for Ms. Lankswert, indicating that her off-work status would continue through April 9, 2025. She emphasized that, to date, they had not received any of the requested documents that had been requested for more than 60 days, with the sole exception being the First Report of Injury, which contained numerous inaccuracies. To avoid further delays or litigation, she asked that the requested documents be forwarded promptly for review. She also requested that the following be included: Ms. Lankswert\u2019s AWW calculation and supporting documentation; her formal job description; an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers; and surveillance footage for the area where the injury occurred.\n\nThat same day, March 26, 2025, Kaitlin Ericksen responded that there was no surveillance footage available.\n\nShortly thereafter, on March 26, 2025, Sarena reiterated to Mr. Lucas and Ms. Wood that the surveillance footage request should be directed to Mr. Lucas as Counsel, since the adjuster could not provide footage.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, at 12:16 PM, Sarena sent another note to Mr. Lucas, Taylor Wood, and others (with Ericksen and Koon copied) announcing that she had attached an updated Work Status reflecting Ms. Lankswert\u2019s off-work status through April 9, 2025. She reiterated that the requested documents had not been received for over sixty days, with the sole exception of the First Report of Injury, which contained incorrect information. She urged that the requested documents\u2014AWW calculation and supporting documentation, the formal job description, an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers, and the surveillance footage for the area of injury\u2014be forwarded promptly to her office for review, to avoid further delays or litigation.\n\nFinally, on March 27, 2025, at 1:13 PM (13:13:18 -0400), Sarena followed up with a corrective note addressed to all recipients. She apologized for a discrepancy in her own calculations concerning week 02.13, noting that it had been listed as a weekly charge twice. She stated that a corrected outline was attached.\n\nSignature details accompany these messages from The Whaley Law Firm. Sarena M. Tuttle signed as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager, providing the firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct contact numbers and her email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and noting the \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d The correspondence also carried the firm\u2019s identification of the case as Shannon Lankswert and referenced the client\u2019s file under The Whaley Law Firm in Kentucky.\n\nIn summary, the March 2025 communications reflect a coordinated effort to correct TTD ledger discrepancies, confirm ongoing off-work status through early April 2025, obtain missing documentation (including AWW calculations, job descriptions, and ledgers), secure surveillance footage for the injury site, and address multiple inconsistencies identified in the First Report of Injury. The exchange also includes guidance on where to obtain surveillance footage and continuous requests for documentation while noting ongoing questions about weekly benefits and state maximums under Kentucky law for 2025.",

      "natural_language": "The case file for Shannon Lankswert (WC80D-H07503) was active in March 2025, with The Whaley Law Firm handling the WC claim on behalf of Shannon Lankswert. Over several days, communications were exchanged between Shannon\u2019s legal team and Liberty Mutual, focusing on medical billing, wage calculations, and surveillance matters, and there were ongoing requests for updated ledgers and supporting documentation.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm informed all recipients that Shannon\u2019s treating provider continued to keep her off work through March 27, 2025, and requested that temporary total disability (TTD) benefits continue. She asked for an update on past-due TTD benefits since the start of the claim. She also noted discrepancies in the First Report of Injury (FROI) and outlined several issues: Shannon\u2019s pay information in the FROI showed $999.99 per week for three days a week, with her salary continuing, but Shannon is a full-time employee who works five days a week and did not continue her salary; she was forced to use PTO and vacation time. The FROI also listed a contusion on her elbow, with no mention of the back injury and bulging disc that resulted from her fall. The incident description in the FROI stated she slipped on the third of four steps, but Shannon\u2019s team understood she slipped on the top step and hit three steps on the way down. Tuttle noted there are cameras covering the area and requested surveillance footage from the time of the incident, but had not received a response or acknowledgment from the Adjuster or Liberty Mutual. She also mentioned that there were cameras in the area and that surveillance footage was being requested.\n\nA little over a week later, on March 26, 2025, at 12:07 PM, Tuttle sent another message to Lance Lucas, Taylor Wood, Bryce Koon, Kaitlin Ericksen, and others, reiterating the need for Shannon\u2019s updated Work Status through April 9, 2025, and stressing that Shannon had still not received many of the requested documents more than 60 days after they were first requested. She emphasized the need for Shannon\u2019s AWW calculation and supporting documentation, a formal job description, an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers, and the surveillance footage for the area where Shannon was injured.\n\nLater that same day, at approximately 1:25 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen replied with attached AWW-1 and a TTD log, stating that Liberty Mutual did not have any surveillance footage.\n\nAt roughly 1:31 PM, Sarena Tuttle responded, clarifying that Liberty Mutual did not have the footage and directing the request to Mr. Lucas as Shannon\u2019s counsel, who could obtain it.\n\nEarlier that day, on March 26 at 12:07 PM, Tuttle had sent a separate note introducing herself and requesting the documents described above; she then followed up that same day with a second message reiterating the surveillance footage request and the need for the other items to move the claim forward.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, at approximately 1:13 PM (time noted as uncertain in the chain), Tuttle acknowledged and apologized for a discrepancy in her own calculations related to week 02.13, noting that it had been listed as a weekly charge twice and attaching a corrected outline.\n\nLater on March 27, at about 2:46 PM, Tuttle sent a longer email again addressing outstanding financial matters. She reported that certified medical billing from Flaget Memorial Hospital showed an outstanding balance after the initial workers\u2019 compensation adjustment. She asked Kaitlin Ericksen to address this billing as well as to provide an update on the Concentra billing, which also reflected no payments. She requested that once these items were addressed, an updated Medical Ledger be forwarded for Whaley Law Firm\u2019s records.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the communications repeatedly referenced the need for updated ledgers and complete documentation, including Shannon\u2019s AWW calculation, a formal job description, TTD and indemnity ledgers, and the requested surveillance footage. The email signatures repeatedly identified Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971 and office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104, and an email address listed as Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as the new address in these communications. Kaitlin Ericksen of Liberty Mutual and several colleagues at Lucas Dietz Law were among the primary recipients and CC\u2019d parties, with Shannon Lankswert identified as the client.\n\nIn summary, during late March 2025 the team worked to resolve outstanding medical bills (including a balance from Flaget Memorial Hospital after the WC adjustment and an outstanding Concentra bill with no payments), obtain an updated Medical Ledger, and secure missing documentation (AWW calculations, job description, TTD/Indemnity ledgers, and surveillance footage) while continuing to address off-work status and discrepancies in the FROI and TTD calculations.",

Tuttle\nLitigation Paralegal &\nWorkers' Compensation Case Manager\nThe Whaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Lane\nLouisville, KY 40222\nD: (502) 357-9971\nO: (502) 583-4022 ext 104\nE: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com\n(PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS)\n\nOn Tue, Mar 18, 2025 at 2:30?PM Sarena Tuttle > wrote:\nGood afternoon everyone,\n We have spoken with Ms. Lankswert's provider moments ago & they are continuing to keep Ms. Lankswert Off Work until March 27, 2025 at which time she will be re-evaluated. Please continue her TTD benefits and provide an update on the past due TTD Benefits from the start of the claims process.\n Further, we have received and reviewed the First Report Of Injury (FROI) from yesterday's discussion and see there are several discrepancies noted in the report. Beginning with her Pay Information, it is noted that she is paid $999.99 a week, 3 days a week, and her salary did continue. Mrs. Lankswert is a full time employee who works 5 days a week and her salary did not continue, she was forced to use PTO & Vacation Time. 2nd",
      "natural_language": "In March 2025, the Shannon Lankswert workers\u2019 compensation claim (WC80D-H07503) was the subject of a series of email exchanges between Shannon Lankswert\u2019s counsel, the Whaley Law Firm, and Liberty Mutual/EX adjusters. The case file was being managed by Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers\u2019 compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and Lance Lucas, Esq., with the law firm Lucas & Dietz, who serves as Shannon\u2019s counsel. Kaitlin Ericksen, a Claims Specialist II with Liberty Mutual, was handling the adjuster side of the claim.\n\nOn March 18, 2025, the Whaley Law Firm informed Liberty Mutual that Shannon\u2019s treating provider was continuing to keep her off work through March 27, 2025, with Shannon to be reevaluated then, and asked Liberty to continue Temporary Total Disability (TTD) benefits and provide an update on past-due TTD benefits from the start of the claim. They also reported discrepancies in the First Report of Injury (FROI). Specifically, the FROI indicated pay of $999.99 per week for three days, but Shannon is a full-time employee\u2014working five days per week\u2014and her salary did not continue; she was forced to use paid time off (PTO) and vacation time. The message noted several additional discrepancies implied by the FROI, and concluded with a partial \u201c2nd,\u201d indicating there was a second item to address.\n\nOn March 26, 2025, the Whaley Law Firm sent an updated Work Status extending Shannon\u2019s off-work status through April 9, 2025. They stated that, to date, they had not received any requested documents that had been outstanding for 60+ days, with the only exception being the First Report of Injury, which contained incorrect information. The firm requested that Liberty address a certified medical billing from Flaget Memorial Hospital reflecting an outstanding balance, and also asked for an update on Concentra billing, which was showing no payments. They asked Liberty to forward an updated Medical Ledger for their records and reminded the recipient to include Shannon\u2019s AWW (Average Weekly Wage) Calculation with supporting documentation, her formal job description, an up-to-date TTD and Indemnity ledgers, and the surveillance footage for the area where Shannon was injured.\n\nEarlier on March 26, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that Liberty did not have any surveillance footage. Sarena Tuttle followed up, clarifying that the request for surveillance footage was directed to Mr. Lucas as Shannon\u2019s counsel, who could obtain the footage if available.\n\nOn March 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle reported that, after reviewing the attached TTD ledger, there were several discrepancies. By their calculations, Shannon was owed a total of $9,070.65, while $6,047.06 had been issued in payments and Shannon had only received $4,031.40; they understood that the last payment of $1,007.85 might be en route for the period 03/25\u201303/31. They requested a status update on the missing payments and asked for clarification as to why Shannon was not receiving the Kentucky State Maximum benefit (which exceeded $1,231.22 for 2025 across four quarters) and whether taxes were being withheld.\n\nAlso on March 27, Sarena apologized for the multiple emails and informed recipients that she had attached a corrected outline for week 02.13, noting that the prior outline had double-charged a weekly amount.\n\nLater that same day, Sarena again addressed the accounting issues, asking that the outstanding balance from Flaget Memorial Hospital be addressed, along with an update on the Concentra billing that showed no payments. She requested that, once these issues were resolved, The Whaley Law Firm receive an updated Medical Ledger for their records.\n\nIn an earlier March 27 email, Kaitlin Ericksen had requested follow-up with Ms. Tuttle to determine why Shannon had been treated at two hospitals, with one treatment occurring a few days after Shannon\u2019s date of injury (DOI). The thread also contained a standard confidentiality disclaimer stating that the messages and attachments were confidential and may be privileged or attorney work product, and provided instructions for unauthorized recipients.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Lance Lucas forwarded to Sarena Tuttle a note from the Liberty adjuster with the question regarding why Shannon was treated at two hospitals. The message included Lucas\u2019s professional contact information and a reminder that the email was encrypted, with the standard confidentiality notice and instructions for unintended recipients.\n\nIn summary, during March 2025, Shannon Lankswert\u2019s claim involved ongoing off-work status and TTD benefits, multiple discrepancies in pay and ledgers, outstanding medical billing from Flaget Memorial Hospital, no payments on Concentra billing, and a request for updated financial ledgers and supporting documentation. There was also an emphasis on obtaining surveillance footage (when available) and clarifying the unusual circumstance of Shannon being treated at two hospitals shortly after her date of injury. The record includes numerous communications among Shannon\u2019s counsel, her law firm, and Liberty Mutual adjusters, all addressing the accuracy of compensation calculations, timing of payments, and completeness of documentation.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents the Shannon Lankswert workers\u2019 compensation matter (Case: Shannon-Lankswert-WC-02-07-2025) and compiles the email correspondence dated March 26\u201328, 2025, involving The Whaley Law Firm and Liberty Mutual, as well as the corresponding parties, including counsel Lance Lucas and others copied on the threads. The matter centers on medical treatment history, billing disputes, and wage-related payments following Shannon Lankswert\u2019s injury.\n\nAccording to the March 28, 2025 message from Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, Ms. Lankswert was not treated at two hospitals. Instead, she was transported by management to Concentra (described as not a hospital). Concentra did nothing for Ms. Lankswert\u2019s injuries or pain, so she followed up with Flaget Memorial Hospital. She alleges that Concentra lied to her and refused to address her back injury, concentrating only on her elbow. Because of this, she moved her treatment closer to home in Bardstown to Advanced Injury Rehab. Advanced Injury Rehab then sent Ms. Lankswert for MRI imaging due to her continued pain. The imaging was performed at The Injury Centers, formerly known as Metro Pain Relief, and it was determined that Ms. Lankswert is suffering from two bulging discs as a result of her fall.\n\nThe author of the above note, Sarena M. Tuttle, is a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her contact information includes a direct line at (502) 357-9971, the office line at (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the address as the new email).\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Lance Lucas, Esq. of Lucas & Dietz, PLLC, forwarded the matter to address a question from the Liberty Adjuster. The question, posed by Kaitlin Ericksen, Claims Specialist II for Liberty Mutual, was to follow up with Ms. Tuttle and determine why Shannon Lankswert was treated at two hospitals, with one treatment occurring a few days after the DOI (date of injury).\n\nEarlier, on March 27, 2025, at 3:09 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen again requested that Lance Lucas follow up with Ms. Tuttle to determine why Shannon Lankswert was treated at two hospitals, one a few days after the DOI. In response, on March 27, 2025 at 1:47 PM, Sarena Tuttle apologized for the multiple emails and stated that certified medical billing had been received from Flaget Memorial Hospital reflecting an outstanding balance after the initial workers\u2019 compensation adjustment. She requested that Liberty address this billing as well as provide an update on the Concentra billing, which reportedly reflected no payments. She concluded by asking that an updated Medical Ledger be forwarded for their records.\n\nEarlier still, on March 27, 2025 at 1:13 PM, Sarena Tuttle apologized for an earlier error and noted a corrected outline was attached, stating that there had been a miscalculation in week 02.13, which had been listed as a weekly charge twice.\n\nAt 12:16 PM on March 27, 2025, Sarena Tuttle advised that the previously attached TTD Ledger contained discrepancies. By their calculations, Ms. Lankswert was owed a total of $9,070.65, yet payments issued amounted to $6,047.06, and Ms. Lankswert had only received $4,031.40. The last payment of $1,007.85 may be en route, covering the period 03.25\u201303.31. The message requested review of the status of the missing payments and asked for clarification as to why Ms. Lankswert was not receiving the State Maximum when all four quarters exceeded the $1,231.22 allowed in Kentucky for 2025, and whether taxes were being withheld.\n\nOn March 26, 2025 at 1:31 PM, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged Kaitlin\u2019s note and stated that as a Workers\u2019 Compensation Adjuster, Liberty likely did not have the footage, and that the request should be directed to Mr. Lucas as Counsel who could obtain it.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 1:25 PM, Kaitlin Ericksen replied that Liberty Mutual did not have any surveillance footage and attached AWW-1 and a TTD log to the correspondence.\n\nThe thread also shows the ongoing exchanges among The Whaley Law Firm and the involved parties, with the March 27 and March 28 messages repeatedly noting the need to address outstanding medical bills (Flaget Memorial Hospital and Concentra), to update the Medical Ledger, and to clarify the discrepancy in compensation payments, as well as the question about the State Maximum thresholds for Kentucky in 2025.\n\nThroughout these communications, the correspondents reference the same core individuals and entities: Shannon Lankswert as the client, The Whaley Law Firm (Sarena M. Tuttle), Lucas & Dietz, PLLC (Lance Lucas), and Liberty Mutual Insurance (Kaitlin Ericksen), with related internal notes about billing, ledgers, and surveillance footage requests. The medical treatment history centers on Concentra (described as not a hospital and accused of misrepresenting care), Flaget Memorial Hospital, Advanced Injury Rehab in Bardstown, and The Injury Centers (formerly Metro Pain Relief), which diagnosed two bulging discs tied to Ms. Lankswert\u2019s fall.",

In Phase 2, four parallel sub-agents analyzed the files independently, with each sub-agent reviewing 33\u201340 files based solely on document content. The results were merged into a comprehensive reorganization plan that entailed 134 file operations. Phase 3 provided an independent quality assurance review, revealing an error rate of 4.1% (4 errors out of 97 files, well below the 20% threshold). Before execution, two date typos were corrected (2026 to 2025 and 2035 to 2025) along with two category errors. In Phase 4, 76 file operations were successfully executed. The scrambled .md files were reunified with their original PDFs using a standardized naming convention, and 4 verified duplicates were deleted. Phase 5 verified the results, with 177 of 187 files organized (a 94.7% completion rate), 100% naming convention compliance, and 100% companion .md file coverage.\n\nFile distribution across the organized repository is as follows: Case Information comprises 18 files (including system JSON files); Client comprises 38 files (intake documents, fee agreements, forms, and correspondence); Investigation comprises 4 files (First Report of Injury and employer correspondence); Medical Records comprises 42 files organized by six providers\u2014Advanced Injury Rehab, Concentra, Flaget Memorial Hospital, Memphis CBO, Metro Pain Relief Center, and The Injury Centers\u2014each with three subfolders; Insurance comprises 22 files (Workers Compensation/Liberty Mutual correspondence); Expenses comprises 2 files (travel reimbursement forms); Litigation comprises 36 files (defense counsel Lucas & Dietz and adjuster correspondence); and Reports comprises 14 files (inventories, mappings, and quality reviews).\n\nThere remain 10 files in the root directory: four PDF files without .md extensions requiring manual categorization, and six .md files flagged for review due to poor OCR quality or unclear dating.\n\nKey achievements of the process include: content-based naming that eliminated filename bias; parallel processing to prevent context exhaustion; medical records properly organized by provider with three subfolders per provider; a Workers\u2019 Compensation structure involving Insurance/Workers Compensation/Liberty Mutual; all email pairs (.eml and .md) maintained together with matching names; and standardized naming: YYYY-MM-DD - Client Name - Category - Originator - Description.\n\nCase context learned: this is a Workers\u2019 Compensation claim for Shannon Lankswert (DOI: 02/07/2025). The client is a 3rd shift fueler at UPS who fell down metal stairs in the fuel yard, striking the back and both arms/elbows. Initial treatment occurred at Concentra (employer-directed), followed by a visit to Flaget Memorial Hospital ER. Primary ongoing treatment has been at Advanced Injury Rehab in Bardstown. Injuries include a lumbar spine contusion, a sacroiliac joint sprain, a right elbow contusion, and cervical radiculopathy. The Workers\u2019 Compensation carrier is Liberty Mutual (Claim #WC80D-H07503, Adjuster: Kaitlin Ericksen). Defense counsel is Lucas & Dietz (Lance Lucas). Temporary Total Disability benefits were disputed initially but were eventually approved. The client remains unable to return to work due to restrictions that UPS cannot accommodate.\n\nAll documentation has been saved to the Reports/ directory for future reference.",
