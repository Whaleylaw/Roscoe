He noted that, in the meantime, the clients\u2019 discovery responses indicated attached photographs of the vehicle in question, but those photographs did not appear on the provided link. He asked whether the other side had photographs of the vehicle and whether the vehicle was still available for inspection. The message closed with Koon\u2019s signature and contact information: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207.

Caal Worldwide, et al. The communications below run in March 2025 and involve counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, with several recipients and cc\u2019d colleagues.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, Michelle Singleton, a Legal Assistant at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, sent an email related to the Abby Sitgraves case (subject: Abby Sitgraves, et al. v. Caal Worldwide, et al.). In that message, she advised counsel to use a provided link to access Caal Worldwide\u2019s answers to discovery in the matter, noting that the link would expire in 10 days. The email included a folder-style indicator labeled \u201cCaal Worldwide\u201d and carried standard confidentiality language typical of firm communications, stating that the message and any attachments were confidential and privileged and should be deleted if received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, at approximately 5:14 PM, Sam Leffert, an Associate at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, wrote to Aaron and Bryce asking for an update on the plaintiffs\u2019 responses to their discovery requests, signaling a request for status on discovery matters in the case.\n\nAlso on March 24, Michelle Singleton\u2019s message was sent to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com and Bryce Koon, with copies to dharvey@carlisle-law.com, Bryce Cotton, and Sam Leffert, among others. The email from Singleton included her contact details for Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC and reiterated the confidentiality notice.\n\nOn March 28, 2025, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm sent a follow-up email to counsel regarding the Abby Sitgraves matter. In this message, sent at 12:45 PM Eastern Time, he advised that he would have the responses over to the recipients in the coming days and thanked them for their patience. He noted that the client\u2019s discovery responses indicated attached photographs of the vehicle involved in the MVA, but those photographs did not appear on the provided link. He then asked several questions: whether the recipients had photographs of the vehicle in question, and whether the vehicle is still available for inspection. The email was directed to Sam Leffert and Michelle Singleton, with copies to Bryce Cotton, \"dharvey@carlisle-law.com,\" Sarena Tuttle, Abby Sitgraves\u2019s Filevine project email address, and Nayram Adadevoh\u2019s Filevine project email address. The message included a standard confidentiality disclaimer and contact information for Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm, including his office address in Louisville, KY, and his phone and fax numbers.\n\nOverall, the communications reflect an ongoing exchange about discovery responses and the status of vehicle-related materials for Abby Sitgraves\u2019s case, including access to photographs, the presence of attached vehicle imagery in discovery responses, and the availability of the vehicle for inspection. The exchanges also include the typical attorney-client privilege notices and contact details from the involved firms.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the email communications in the Abby Sitgraves v. Caal Worldwide et al. matter (Case: Abby-Sitgraves-MVA-7-13-2024; Client: Abby Sitgraves) between Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, The Whaley Law Firm, and associated colleagues regarding discovery responses and potential motions.\n\nOn March 24, 2025, Michelle Singleton, a legal assistant at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, sent counsel a message directing them to use a link to access Caal Worldwide\u2019s answers to discovery in the matter. She noted that the link would expire in 10 days and asked recipients to contact her with any questions. The message was copied to multiple recipients, including Sam Leffert and Bryce Koon, among others, and included the typical confidentiality notice.\n\nLater the same day, at approximately 5:14 PM, Sam Leffert of Blackburn Domene & Burchett emailed Bryce Koon and Michelle Singleton, asking for an update on Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses. He stated that if there was no update by April 14, the firm would file a motion to compel.\n\nA week earlier, on March 28, 2025 at 12:46 PM, Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm replied to Sam and Michelle. He said counsel would provide the responses in the coming days and thanked them for their patience. He also noted an issue with the attached photographs: the discovery responses apparently included photographs of the vehicle, but those photographs did not appear on the provided link. He asked whether there were photographs of the vehicle in question and whether the vehicle was still available for inspection. His message included his firm\u2019s contact details and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nThe thread includes earlier exchanges as well. On March 24, 2025 at 4:26 PM, Michelle Singleton asked counsel to use the link provided to access Caal Worldwide\u2019s discovery answers, stating the link would expire in 10 days. She signed the email as the Legal Assistant for Blackburn Domene & Burchett.\n\nOn April 4, 2025 at 2:45 PM, Sam Leffert again asked Bryce and Michelle if there was an update on the discovery responses, copying the same recipients and maintaining the confidential-notice language.\n\nOn April 8, 2025 at 11:02 AM, Sam sent another message to Bryce Koon and Michelle Singleton (and with copies to others), again asking for an update on Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery responses. He added that if there was no update by April 14, they would file a motion to compel.\n\nFinally, on April 14, 2025 at 8:38 PM UTC, Sam wrote to Bryce: \u201cBryce \u2013 I am following up on the below. If I do not have a response by EOD tomorrow we will plan to file a motion to compel (MTC) to be heard next Monday.\u201d This message closed the thread with Sam reiterating the plan to seek relief if no update was provided by the end of the following day.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the emails were sent from and to counsel at Blackburn Domene & Burchett and The Whaley Law Firm, with multiple cc\u2019d recipients including filevine project email addresses tied to Abby Sitgraves and Nayram Adadevoh, and included the customary confidentiality notices present in such communications. The underlying issues center on discovery responses from Caal Worldwide, the status of those responses, any missing or non-accessible supporting photographs of the vehicle referenced in the responses, and potential motions to compel if updates were not provided by the stated deadlines.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Abby-Sitgraves-MVA-7-13-2024 concerned Abby Sitgraves, with the matter captioned Re: Adadevoh, et al. v. CAAL Worldwide, et al. (Jefferson 25-CI-00133). The communication thread concerns the discovery dispute in that case. The email chain lists The Whaley Law Firm, representing Abby Sitgraves, and Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, representing the opposing side. The matter involves the underlying motor vehicle accident dated July 13, 2024, and the case caption in Jefferson County (Jefferson 25-CI-00133). The message was titled in reference to Adadevoh v. CAAL Worldwide and related parties, and the distribution included the following recipients: Bryce Cotton of Blackburn Domene & Burchett, with copies to Sam Leffert, AbbySitgravesMVAZ4665577@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and NayramAdadevohMVAZ4669798@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The email was sent on Friday, May 9, 2025 at 03:05:35 GMT-04:00, from W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number listed as (502) 365-5043 and fax as (502) 237-3207. The message concluded with the signature: \u201cI will await your response. Thank you, W. Bryce Koon, Esq.\u201d The message carried the standard attorney-client privilege notice and confidentiality language typical of the firm\u2019s correspondence.\n\nEarlier on the same day, at approximately 2:43 PM, Bryce Koon sent a message to counsel indicating that he had attached correspondence for review and that counsel should please see it. This message included the standard confidentiality notice and a caution that the email was external, advising recipients to exercise care with links or attachments. The attachment referenced in that email was labeled \u201cLT DC re CAAL Discovery.pdf,\u201d suggesting it contained relevant discovery-related material in the CAAL case.\n\nAt around 3:03 PM, May 9, 2025, Bryce Cotton, acting as Legal Counsel and Partner for Blackburn Domene & Burchett, replied to the thread. In his response, he criticized the course of conduct, stating: \u201cAre you seriously threatening to seek fees on a simple discovery dispute after ignoring our emails for weeks? What an absolute joke\u2026.\u201d His signature block identified him as Legal Counsel, Partner at Blackburn Domene & Burchett, PLLC, with offices at 614 West Main Street, Suite 3000, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. His contact information included a office line (502.584.1600), a direct dial (502.371.0589), a fax number (502.584.9971), and his email address bcotton@bdblawky.com. The message also carried Blackburn Domene & Burchett\u2019s confidentiality notice, the standard \u201cthis e-mail contains confidential information\u201d disclaimer, and a separate notice stating that if the message was received in error, the recipient should notify the firm and delete it. The message reiterated that this was an external email, and advised caution when clicking on links or opening attachments.\n\nIn summary, on May 9, 2025, a three-part email exchange occurred regarding the CAAL discovery dispute in Adadevoh v. CAAL Worldwide, with the parties\u2019 counsel distributing and replying to the thread. The initial May 2:43 PM message from Bryce Koon instructed counsel to review an attached correspondence; the 3:03 PM reply from Bryce Cotton criticized the predicament and threatened fees in connection with the discovery dispute; and the 3:05 PM follow-up from Bryce Koon reaffirmed that he would await a response. The exchanges included CCs to Sam Leffert and the Abby Sitgraves and Nayram Adadevoh filevine addresses, and referenced an attachment labeled LT DC re CAAL Discovery.pdf, with standard privilege and external-email cautions in the signature blocks.",
