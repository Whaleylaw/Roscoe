      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T. Johnson.\n\nIn April 2024, a follow-up matter regarding Charles Johnson’s medical records from his motor vehicle accident case was handled through a series of email exchanges between The Whaley Law Firm and Integra Medical Imaging. On April 9, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Adriana Medina at Integra Medical Imaging to acknowledge the clarification and the Certification. In her message, she thanked Adriana for the clarification and the certification, and she signed off with her title, the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (D: 502-357-9971) and office line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), her email (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com), and a note to please “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nThe email thread shows several exchanges within a short window. In one message dated Tue, Apr 9, 2024 at 1:34?PM, Adriana stated that she had attached signed forms and that there was no itemized billing for Mr. Johnson, clarifying that they do not bill the patient. She explained that Integra Medical Imaging leases its services to a chiropractic office and that the chiropractic office should have an itemized bill for Mr. Johnson. Her signature block identified Integra Medical Imaging and included the following details: 2137 Dixie Highway, Louisville, KY 40210; Phone: 859-757-2297; Fax: 859-757-2042; website: www.integradx.com.\n\nEarlier in the thread, in an email sent on the same day, 1:18?PM, Adriana had provided the actual medical records and stated: “Good afternoon Sarena, Attached are all medical records Integra Medical Imaging has for patient Charles Johnson 04-01-1952. We did not bill patient directly, please contact referring chiropractic office for additional information. Please let me know if you have any questions.” The signature block for this message again listed Integra Medical Imaging with the address and contact information noted above.\n\nFollowing Adriana’s 1:18?PM message, Sarena replied at 1:21?PM with a brief acknowledgment: “Thank you so much Adriana!” Her signature block again included The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and the note to please use the new email address.\n\nSubsequently, at 1:25 PM, Sarena sent another message explaining that, upon review of the attached medical records, she did not see a Certification Form or Billing. She stated that she had attached a certification form for Adriana’s convenience and requested that the form be completed and returned to The Whaley Law Firm along with the itemized billing for Mr. Johnson.\n\nShortly after, at 1:34?PM, Adriana replied with the signed forms and reiterated that there is no itemized billing for Mr. Johnson, as they do not bill the patient. She noted that Integra Medical Imaging leases its services to the chiropractic office and that the chiropractic office should have the itemized bill for Mr. Johnson. Her message concluded with her signature block, which again listed Integra Medical Imaging’s contact details.\n\nIn summary, the exchange between The Whaley Law Firm and Integra Medical Imaging in this case involved provision of all medical records for Charles Johnson (born 04-01-1952), confirmation that the patient was not billed directly, and a request for an itemized billing and a completed Certification Form to accompany the records. The parties cited that the itemized bill should come from the referring chiropractic office, to whom the services were leased.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T. Johnson. This record covers a series of email exchanges concerning discovery responses in the motor-vehicle-accident case Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe, 24-CI-002475, which arises from the 4/18/2023 MVA.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, at 10:18 AM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an external message to counsel for the opposing party regarding the case. The email was addressed to Mary [last name] of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC (mary@dilbeckandmyers.com) and was CC’d to Amy Romine (amy@dilbeckandmyers.com) and to Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 via the Filevine project email address CharlesJohnsonZ3709312@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, with Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) also copied. The subject line read: EXTERNAL MESSAGE Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475). In the body, Koon stated that he was following up on the client’s outstanding discovery responses that had been served with the Plaintiff’s Complaint, noting that he had attempted to reach out several times without receiving a response. He warned that if no response was received, he would be forced to file a motion to compel, and he requested any update. He closed with his name and contact details: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The message carried a standard confidentiality or privilege notice typical of such communications, which stated that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged or protected information, and if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and refrain from using or forwarding the information.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, Mary [last name] of Dilbeck & Myers replied to Bryce Koon. She apologized for the delay, explaining that she did have the discovery responses but needed to type them up and format them. She noted she had been in trial and described the “digging out” as the worst part of trial, adding that she would get the responses ready hopefully the following week and thanked Bryce for his patience. Mary provided her contact information: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504. The message included a standard confidentiality notice: “NOTICE: This electronic mail transmission is for the use of the named individual or entity to which it is directed and may contain information that is privileged or confidential. It is not to be transmitted to or received by anyone other than the named addressee (or a person authorized to deliver it to the named addressee). It is not to be copied or forwarded to any unauthorized persons. If you have received this electronic mail transmission in error, delete it from your system without copying or forwarding it, and notify the sender of the error by replying via email or by calling Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC at (502) 595-6500, so that our address record can be corrected.”\n\nThe September 3, 2024 message from Bryce that initiated this thread is also reflected in the chain. In that prior message, Bryce reiterated the request for the client’s discovery responses, stated that the responses had been served with the Plaintiff’s Complaint, and warned that failure to respond would result in a motion to compel. The message included the same contact details for Bryce Koon and The Whaley Law Firm as noted above, along with the same Filevine project address for the Charles Johnson matter and the same confidential notice.\n\nFinally, on September 18, 2024, at 2:56 PM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon sent another follow-up to counsel. The message began, “Good afternoon counsel, Any update on your client’s discovery responses?” and concluded with thanks in advance. It again carried Bryce Koon’s contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email carried the same standard confidentiality or privilege notice as the previous messages, indicating the restricted and privileged nature of the communication and directing recipients who were not the intended addressees to contact the sender and refrain from using or forwarding the information.",

Mary indicated she did not have the technological capability to send a DocuSign herself and concluded that she would have to wait until next week to obtain the verification signed. Mary’s signature included her contact information: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. The email also contained a standard confidentiality notice warning that the transmission is for the named recipient and privileged or confidential, and instructing the recipient to delete or notify the sender if received in error.\n\nLater that same day, September 18, 2024, at 14:57 (Pacific time indicated in the mail system, with the message continuing in the thread), Bryce Koon replied to Mary and Amy Romine. He addressed them as counsels and asked for an update on the client’s discovery responses. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, including his Louisville, Kentucky office address, phone, and fax. The reply included standard email signatures and a confidentiality disclaimer stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain privileged information; the recipient was advised not to use or forward the information if received in error.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on Friday, September 6, 2024, at approximately 4:13 PM, Mary wrote to Bryce. She apologized and explained that she had the client’s discovery responses but needed to type them up and format them. She noted she had been in trial and described the process of “digging out” as the worst part of trial. She projected that she would have the responses ready “hopefully next week” and thanked Bryce for his patience. Mary again provided her contact details and included the same confidential email notice as in her previous messages.\n\nThe thread also shows an earlier message from Bryce on Tuesday, September 3, 2024, at 10:18 AM. Bryce addressed Mary, with Amy Romine and the Filevine CC included, and stated that he was following up on the client’s outstanding discovery responses that were served with the Plaintiff’s Complaint. He explained that he had attempted several times to reach out regarding these responses but had not heard back. He warned that if there was no response, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. This message carried The Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and a confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nIn sum, within this email chain concerning the MVA case of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475), the parties discuss readiness and verification for the client’s matter, the potential use of DocuSign for signature, and ongoing discovery responses. There is an interim expectation that the discovery responses will be typed and finalized in the coming week, following Mary’s note that she would finalize and format them after the trial-related delay, along with multiple confidentiality notices accompanying each transmission.",

      "natural_language": "In the motor vehicle accident matter Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (case number 24-CI-002475), filed as Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023, the client is Charles T Johnson. An email thread began with an external message circulated on September 18, 2024, at 14:56:34 -0400, regarding this case. The message was sent by W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and was addressed to counsel Mary . (of Dilbeck & Myers) with Amy Romine CC’d, and also CC’d the Filevine project email address CharlesJohnsonZ3709312@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com and Sarena Tuttle. The subject line read: EXTERNAL MESSAGE Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475). The body of the message began, “Good afternoon counsel,” and asked for an update on the client’s discovery responses, noting that the responses had been served with the Plaintiff’s Complaint and that Bryce had attempted several times to reach out without a reply. He warned that if no response was received, he would be forced to file a motion to compel, and he closed with “Any update appreciated.” His signature block provided his name, title, and contact information for The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. Included in this email were standard confidentiality and privilege notices typical of electronic communications, stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient, may contain attorney‑client privileged material, and instructing the recipient to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message was received in error and not to disclose or forward it.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on September 3, 2024 at 10:18 AM, Bryce Koon had sent an initial email with the same subject line, EXTERNAL MESSAGE Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475). That message was addressed to Mary . and CC’d Amy Romine and the Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 Filevine Project Email Address, with the Filevine address CharlesJohnsonZ3709312@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com included in the CC line. Bryce’s Sept. 3 message stated: “Good morning counsel, I am again writing to follow up on your client’s outstanding discovery responses which were served with Plaintiff's Complaint. I have tried a few times to reach out regarding these responses but have not heard anything back. If I do not hear back from you in this regard, I will be forced to file a motion to compel. Any update appreciated.” The email closed with Bryce’s signature block and the firm’s contact information (same as above) and carried the same confidentiality and privilege notices found in the later message.\n\nIn response, on Friday, September 6, 2024, at 4:13?PM (the record shows a time noted as 4:13?PM), Mary . replied to Bryce. She apologized and explained that she already had the client’s responses but needed to type them up and present them neatly. She said she had been in trial and that “the digging out is the WORST part of trial,” but she expected to have the responses ready \"hopefully next week\" and thanked Bryce for his patience. Mary S. Johnson’s reply included her contact information—8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504—and carried the same confidentiality notice as in the prior communications. The email thread, as with the others, included the confidentiality and privilege disclaimers warning against distribution to unauthorized persons.\n\nThe thread also contains the earlier portion of Bryce’s Sept. 3 message, which the Sept. 6 reply references, including the subject line and the distribution list (Mary .; Amy Romine; Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address) and the Filevine contact address. The overall exchange centers on Bryce’s request for the client’s discovery responses, the defense counsel’s acknowledgment that the responses exist but require formatting and typing, and the potential filing of a motion to compel if cooperation is not forthcoming.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T. Johnson.\n\nIn the matter of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475), the following sequence of external communications took place between counsel in late September 2024. On September 3, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, emailed counsel for the defense regarding the plaintiff’s discovery responses. He noted that the client’s discovery responses had been served with the Plaintiff’s Complaint and stated that if no update was provided, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. The email was addressed to Mary S. Johnson (of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC) and copied to Amy Romine, the Filevine project email for Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023, and Sarena Tuttle. The Whaley Law Firm listed its office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207. The message carried the standard confidentiality notice common to these communications.\n\nOn September 6, 2024, Mary S. Johnson replied. She apologized and said she did have the client’s responses but needed to type them up and format them. She explained she had been in trial and described the discovery task as “the digging out” being the worst part of trial. She indicated she would prepare the materials and have them ready “hopefully next week.” Her signature block included her address at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, with a phone number of (502) 595-6500 and a fax number of (502) 595-6504, and a confidentiality notice appended to the email.\n\nThe exchange continued on September 18, 2024. At 2:57 PM, Bryce Koon followed up again, asking for an update on the client’s discovery responses. In the ensuing message thread, Mary S. Johnson responded later that day, indicating that the discovery responses were ready to go but that she was waiting on the client’s verification. She explained that the client was out of town and had said that if she could send him a DocuSign, he would return it promptly; however, she did not have the technological capability to perform that. Consequently, she anticipated having to wait until the following week to obtain the verification signed. The emails in this portion of the thread included standard confidentiality notices.\n\nAlso on September 18, 2024, at approximately 3:01 PM, the same Mary S. Johnson reiterated that the answers were ready but waiting on verification, reiterating the client’s being out of town and his preference for DocuSign, which she could not facilitate, and again noting that she expected to wait until the next week to secure the signed verification. These messages again carried the confidentiality notices typical to the correspondence.\n\nFinally, on September 25, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an external message reiterating the ongoing status and shifting the focus to scheduling. He stated that they were still awaiting the client’s discovery responses and requested that dates in mid- to late October be provided when counsel and the client would be available to proceed with the deposition. The subject of the message remained the same: Re: EXTERNAL MESSAGE Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475). The email was sent to Mary S. Johnson and was CC’d to Amy Romine, the Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 Filevine Project Email Address, and Sarena Tuttle; it also included the same confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, the case at issue remains the automobile accident matter (MVA) involving Charles T. Johnson and Robert Lowe, with the deposition currently being scheduled and discovery responses still outstanding as of late September 2024. The communications reference the parties’ respective law firms, the Filevine project email address for the case, and the contact details listed above for The Whaley Law Firm and for Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC.",

      "natural_language": "In the motor vehicle accident matter of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (docket 24-CI-002475), Charles T. Johnson is the client. The case is referenced as Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023, with the incident occurring on April 18, 2023. The primary communications presented here are a series of emails between W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, regarding discovery responses and deposition scheduling.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an external message to counsel handling Charles Johnson’s case, asking for an update on the client’s outstanding discovery responses that were served with the plaintiff’s complaint. He noted that he had attempted several times to obtain a response and warned that if he did not hear back, he would be forced to file a motion to compel. He requested dates in mid- to late October when the client and counsel would be available for the deposition.\n\nMary S. Johnson replied on September 6, 2024. She apologized and stated that she did have the client’s discovery responses but needed to type them up and present them nicely. She explained she had been in trial and described the process of “digging out” as the worst part of trial, adding that she would get the responses ready hopefully next week and thanked Bryce for his patience.\n\nIn the subsequent messages, Mary’s communications include her contact information and a standard confidentiality notice. The note shows she was at 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, with phone and fax numbers listed, and that the notice asks recipients to delete and notify if the email was received in error.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, Mary wrote again: “Yes. They are ready to go, but I am waiting on his verification. He is out of town and he said if I can send him a DocuSign, he would send it right back. Well, I don’t think I have the technological capabilities to do that. So, I guess I will have to wait until next week to get the verification signed.” This message indicates that the client’s verification was pending and that DocuSign would have been convenient but was not available to her.\n\nLater that same day, September 18, 2024 at 2:57 p.m., Bryce Koon followed up with Mary, asking, “Good afternoon counsel, Any update on your client’s discovery responses?” He again referenced the ongoing status of the discovery responses and requested any available information.\n\nFinally, on September 25, 2024 at 9:24 a.m. (Eastern Time), Bryce sent another external message reiterating that they were still awaiting the client’s discovery responses. He asked to schedule the deposition and requested that Mary provide dates in mid- to late October when she and her client would be available for deposition. He included his contact details for scheduling at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm’s phone and fax numbers.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the subject line consistently referred to the matter: Re: EXTERNAL MESSAGE Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (24-CI-002475). The communications convey a coordinated effort to obtain and finalize discovery materials and to schedule the deposition, with the October timeframe as the target for availability, while discovery responses remained outstanding at the time of the latest messages.",

      "natural_language": "This note concerns the Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe matter in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-002475, in which the client is Charles T. Johnson. The matter involves filings related to a motor vehicle accident dated 4/18/2023. The communications described below come from and between The Whaley Law Firm and the Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC office, with the Filevine project for Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 referenced in the CC line.\n\nOn October 8, 2024, at 1:49 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mary S. Johnson at Dilbeck & Myers, with the Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 Filevine project email address included in the CC line. The subject of the email was Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jefferson 24-CI-002475). In the body, Bryce stated good morning counsel and asked to review the attachments, noting that they had been filed today in Jefferson Circuit Court. He invited any questions and closed with his contact information and firm details, including The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone and fax numbers.\n\nThat same day, October 8, 2024, at 4:27 PM, Mary S. Johnson replied. She apologized for the delay, explaining that she had the materials ready for a few days but had been occupied with oral arguments. She indicated that she had changed the date on the certificate to today and invited Bryce to inform her if there were any issues with the attachments. She provided her contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504. She also included a confidentiality and privileged-information notice stating that the electronic transmission is for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, and that it should not be copied or forwarded to unauthorized persons. If received in error, she asked the recipient to delete the message and notify Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC at the listed phone number so their address records could be corrected.\n\nThe email thread also carried the standard disclaimer common to these communications, affirming that the message is intended only for the named recipient and may contain attorney-client privileged information; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and should not disclose or forward the information.\n\nOn October 10, 2024, at 10:31 AM, Bryce Koon again wrote to counsel in the same matter with the subject Re: Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jefferson 24-CI-002475). He stated, Good morning counsel, and informed them to please see the attached Notice of Remand filed today. The email bore his signature and the same firm contact details as before (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207). It also included the standard attorney-client privilege notice reiterating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be shared with unauthorized persons; if received in error, the recipient should contact The Whaley Law Firm and delete or forward the notice only as appropriate, with no waiver of privilege.\n\nThe email from Mary on October 8 contained a separate confidentiality disclaimer, reiterating that the transmission is for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, not to be copied or forwarded to unauthorized persons, and instructions to delete and notify the sender if received in error, with a contact number for Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC to correct their address record. The thread thus records the filing of a Notice of Remand today in Jefferson Circuit Court, accompanied by prior attachments and the ongoing exchange of due-diligence communications between the parties’ counsel.",

      "natural_language": "In the motor vehicle accident case Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe in Jefferson Circuit Court (Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475), the file labeled Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023 contains a sequence of email communications between counsel. The principal client is Charles T. Johnson, with the correspondence involving Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC and The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, at 18:36:19 UTC, Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC sent an email to Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley, with Sarena Tuttle and Amy Romine CC’d. In the body of the message Mary conveyed that Mr. Lowe would be available on November 26 after 2:00 PM. She proposed scheduling Mr. Johnson at 1:00 PM and then Mr. Lowe afterward, to avoid extending the day too late, and asked whether that arrangement would work for the opposing side and the clients. Mary noted a preference for conducting the deposition by Zoom, though she was willing to appear in person if that was the other party’s preference. Her contact details were provided as follows: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. The email also contained a standard confidentiality notice indicating that the transmission was intended for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, not to be copied or forwarded to unauthorized persons, and asking the recipient to delete it if received in error and to notify the sender to correct the address.\n\nEarlier, on October 28, 2024, at 12:34 PM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mary Johnson and Amy Romine, with Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley copied. The subject line read Re: Charles Johnson v Robert Lowe - Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475. Sarena stated that they had requested deposition dates for Mr. Lowe on several occasions over the prior 30 days but had not yet received any dates to complete Mr. Lowe’s deposition. She asked that dates be provided as soon as possible, noting that calendars would fill up quickly with holidays approaching. Her signature block identified her as with The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\n\nIn a prior exchange, on October 23, 2024, at approximately 3:36 PM, Sarena Tuttle informed Mrs. Johnson that, on September 25, 2024, Bryce had sent an email following up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the Plaintiff’s Discovery Request and had requested dates on which Mr. Lowe would be available to be deposed. Sarena asked Mrs. Johnson to provide some available dates for the following month. The message included Sarena’s standard signature block with her contact information and again noted the new email address: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Direct: (502) 357-9971; Office: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; Email: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\n\nThe correspondence thread also includes Mary’s November 4, 2024, note with her contact details and the same memorialized address and numbers for Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, and reiterates the confidentiality warning. The overall record reflects ongoing efforts by both sides to schedule the deposition of Mr. Lowe in relation to the case, with ongoing requests for deposition dates and consideration of scheduling preferences and modalities.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe, Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475, the client is Charles T. Johnson. The correspondence dated in late October through early November 2024 documents efforts to schedule the deposition of Mr. Lowe and to confirm dates and format for depositions related to the Jeff Cir case.\n\nOn October 23, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and the Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mrs. Mary S. Johnson (of Dilbeck & Myers) with the subject Charles Johnson v Robert Lowe - Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475. In that message, Sarena noted that Bryce had previously sent an email on September 25, 2024, following up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the Plaintiff’s Discovery Request and acknowledged receipt of those responses. However, Bryce had also requested dates on which Mr. Lowe would be available to be deposed, and Sarena asked Mary to provide some available dates for the deposition next month.\n\nLater, on October 28, 2024 at 12:34 PM, Sarena again corresponded with Mary and Amy Romine (also of Dilbeck & Myers) with Bryce and Aaron Whaley CC’d. In this follow-up, Sarena stated that they had requested dates to depose Mr. Lowe on several occasions over the past 30 days but had not yet received any dates to complete the deposition. She urged Mary to provide dates as soon as possible, noting that the holidays were approaching and calendars would fill up quickly. Her message included her signature and contact information, including her new email address, and reaffirmed her role as a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, Mary S. Johnson replied from Dilbeck & Myers. In her message, she stated that Mr. Lowe would be available on November 26 after 2:00 PM. She proposed scheduling Mr. Johnson’s deposition at 1:00 PM and then Mr. Lowe afterward, explaining that this arrangement would keep the proceedings from running too late. She asked whether this schedule would work for Sarena’s client and stated a preference for Zoom, while also indicating a willingness to appear in person if that was preferred. Mary provided her contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, Phone: (502) 595-6500, Fax: (502) 595-6504. A confidentiality notice followed in the message, stating that this electronic transmission is for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, not to be transmitted to unauthorized persons, and instructing the recipient to delete the message and notify the sender if received in error.\n\nAlso in the November 4, 2024 email chain, Sarena responded on the same day at 1:36 PM confirming receipt of Mary’s scheduling proposal and further clarifying the plan. She accepted the November 26, 2024 date, indicated reliance on Zoom as the desired mode of participation, and proposed a one-hour deposition for Mr. Johnson beginning at 1:00 PM, with the understanding that Mr. Lowe would follow after that deposition, all to be conducted on November 26 via Zoom.\n\nThe chain then includes the signature of Sarena M. Tuttle, reiterating her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, along with the firm’s address and contact numbers: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and a note to note the new email address.\n\nIn sum, the parties coordinated to hold depositions on November 26, 2024, with Mary proposing that Mr. Johnson be deposed at 1:00 PM and Mr. Lowe afterward, all to be conducted by Zoom (though in-person attendance was not ruled out). Sarena subsequently confirmed that Zoom would be suitable and that the Johnson deposition would be one hour starting at 1:00 PM, with Mr. Lowe’s deposition to follow. The correspondence also reflects ongoing efforts to obtain deposition dates for Mr. Lowe and to finalize scheduling in light of the approaching holidays, along with standard confidentiality notices and contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T. Johnson. This note covers email communications concerning the deposition schedule in the matter Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475).\n\nThe exchanges began with a threaded email chain in October 2024. On October 23, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers, LLC, asking Mrs. Johnson to provide dates for Mr. Lowe’s deposition. She noted that, on September 25, 2024, Bryce had followed up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the plaintiff’s discovery requests and requested dates when Mr. Lowe would be available for deposition. Sarena stressed the importance of receiving dates promptly because the holidays were approaching and calendars would fill up quickly. Each of these messages included a confidentiality notice stating that the transmission is for the named recipient and may contain privileged or confidential information, and advising the recipient not to copy or forward the email to unauthorized persons.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, Sarena sent another message reiterating that dates to depose Mr. Lowe had not yet been provided despite multiple requests over the prior 30 days, and she urged providing dates as soon as possible given the upcoming holidays.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, Mary S. Johnson replied that Mr. Lowe was available on November 26 after 2:00 PM. She proposed that Mr. Johnson be deposed at 1:00 PM and Mr. Lowe after him, explaining that this arrangement would help avoid going too late in the day. Mary also stated a preference for Zoom depositions but indicated she would appear in person if that was the other side’s preference. Mary signed with her Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. The message again carried the confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nShortly after, on the same day, Sarena responded that a November 26 deposition via Zoom was perfectly fine and asked for confirmation that one hour would be sufficient to depose Mr. Johnson, who was set to start at 1:00 PM. This exchange also contained the usual confidentiality notice.\n\nFinally, on November 7, 2024, Mary wrote that she typically allocates between one and one-and-a-half hours per deposition, so she suggested starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 PM to allow a safer window. She noted that because the depositions would be conducted by Zoom, it would be easier to provide a brief break between the two sessions. She asked whether this adjusted plan would work for the other side and their client. Mary’s message again included her firm’s contact information and the confidentiality notice.\n\nIn summary, the parties and their counsel were coordinating to depose Mr. Lowe and Mr. Johnson on November 26, 2024, via Zoom. The proposed schedule envisioned Mr. Johnson’s deposition beginning at 1:00 PM for potentially up to an hour, followed by Mr. Lowe’s deposition beginning around 2:30 PM (with a break between sessions), all contingent on mutual agreement. Throughout the correspondence, the emails consistently advised that the transmission contained privileged or confidential information and should not be copied or forwarded to unauthorized recipients.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T Johnson. In the matter of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475), communications in November 2024 between The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers focused on scheduling depositions of the plaintiffs and witnesses.\n\nStarting in late September 2024, Bryce Koon of Dilbeck & Myers emailed following up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the plaintiff’s discovery request and requested dates on which Mr. Lowe would be available for deposition, asking for dates next month. On October 23, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm replied, asking Mary to provide some dates next month when Mr. Lowe would be available for deposition. A week later, on October 28, 2024, Sarena sent a further note stating that they had requested deposition dates for Mr. Lowe over the previous 30 days but had not yet received any, and urged Mary to provide dates as soon as possible given the upcoming holidays and calendars filling up.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, at 1:36 PM, Mary Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers replied that Mr. Lowe was available on November 26 after 2:00 PM, and that they could arrange for Mr. Johnson to be deposed at 1:00 PM and then depose Mr. Lowe afterward, noting a preference for Zoom but willingness to appear in person if that was preferred. The Whaley Law Firm’s Sarena Tuttle responded later the same day at 2:38 PM, confirming that November 26 via Zoom was perfectly fine and asking for confirmation that there would be only a one-hour deposition for Mr. Johnson starting at 1:00 PM.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, at 10:03 AM, Mary replied that she typically allocates 1 to 1.5 hours for depositions, and suggested starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 PM to be safe, with a break between the two depositions given that the proceedings would be conducted via Zoom. She asked whether that arrangement would work. Shortly thereafter, at 10:07:35 AM, Sarena replied that this would not work. She explained that if anything delayed the plaintiff’s deposition, Bryce and Aaron would not have enough time to complete their depositions within business hours. She expressed a reluctance to schedule something so close to the wire, especially during the holiday season, noting that the weather could be unpredictable. She proposed looking at additional dates with a 10:00–11:00 AM start time if available.\n\nEarlier in the thread, the November 26 date remained a focal point, with the November 4 exchanges indicating a desire to arrange Mr. Johnson’s deposition at 1:00 PM and Mr. Lowe’s after that time, preferably by Zoom. The thread also contains a few standard confidentiality disclosures typical of electronic mail communications between counsel.\n\nIn sum, the parties have been negotiating dates for the depositions of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Lowe in late November 2024, with the latest proposals centering on a 1:00 PM start for Mr. Johnson and a subsequent deposition for Mr. Lowe on November 26, 2024, via Zoom. There remains concern about the duration and scheduling proximity of the two depositions, with the parties considering alternative dates and earlier start times (such as a 10:00–11:00 AM window) to avoid logistical conflicts and weather-related delays during the holiday season.",

      "natural_language": "The matter is Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475), a motor vehicle collision case arising from the accident on April 18, 2023. The deposition scheduling communications occurred between Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, representing Charles T. Johnson, and The Whaley Law Firm, regarding when Mr. Lowe and Mr. Johnson would be deposed, with a Zoom-based deposition planned for November 26, 2024.\n\nIn late October 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mary S. Johnson (of Dilbeck & Myers) asking for dates in which Mr. Lowe would be available to be deposed. The note, dated October 23, 2024, referenced that Bryce had previously sent a follow-up on Mr. Lowe’s discovery responses and requested dates for his deposition next month. The message urged Mary to provide available dates, noting that holidays were approaching and calendars would fill quickly.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, Sarena followed up again, indicating that they had requested deposition dates for Mr. Lowe on several occasions over the past 30 days but had not yet received any dates. She asked that dates be provided as soon as possible due to the upcoming holidays when calendars would fill.\n\nBy November 4, 2024, Mary replied with scheduling options. At 1:36 PM, she stated that Mr. Lowe was available on November 26 after 2:00 PM and suggested that they could depose Mr. Johnson at 1:00 PM and then depose Mr. Lowe afterward, in order not to go too late. She noted a preference for Zoom but was willing to appear in person if that was the other side’s preference. Her message included her contact details and the standard confidentiality notice typically included in Dilbeck & Myers emails.\n\nLater the same day, at 2:38 PM, Mary clarified further that November 26 via Zoom was perfectly fine and asked whether the other side was comfortable with only one hour to depose Mr. Johnson, who they proposed to start at 1:00 PM. She reiterated that arrangement and the Zoom preference.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, at 10:03 AM (with the timestamp appearing as “10:03? AM,” continuing the thread), Mary wrote that she usually takes between 1 and 1.5 hours for depositions and proposed starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 PM to provide a bit of a break between the two parties’ depositions. She again noted that because the deposition would be by Zoom, a short break would be helpful, and she asked whether that start time would work. Her message again included her full contact details and the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 10:08 AM on November 7, 2024, Sarena replied. She indicated that November 26, via Zoom, was perfectly fine and asked whether the parties were comfortable with only one hour to depose Mr. Johnson, who would start at 1:00 PM.\n\nLater on November 7, 2024 at 3:11 PM (the timestamp shown as 15:11:44 +0000), Mary responded: “Ok. I will ask Mr. Lowe what he has available at that time.” This marked the latest development in the exchange, with the plan to confirm Mr. Lowe’s availability for the November 26 deposition date via Zoom and to finalize the start times.\n\nThroughout the email thread, the correspondents included multiple participants from both firms. Mary S. Johnson’s messages carried the Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC notice about privilege and confidentiality and provided her Louisville, Kentucky contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. The Whaley Law Firm communications were signed by Sarena M. Tuttle, with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the new email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noted as the new contact). The messages also included standard confidentiality notices in each email.\n\nIn summary, the parties continued to plan for a Zoom deposition on November 26, 2024, with Mr. Johnson expected to be deposed first (at 1:00 PM for roughly one hour) and Mr. Lowe to follow, potentially beginning after 2:00 PM, with the understanding that a break between the two depositions would be preferable due to the Zoom format. Mary would confirm Mr. Lowe’s availability for the time slots at hand, and all parties awaited final confirmation of the exact start times and the sequence for the November 26 deposition.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T Johnson. This matter concerns Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe, listed as Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475, a matter arising from a motor vehicle accident on April 18, 2023.\n\nIn November 2024, the scheduling of depositions for the plaintiff, Mr. Charles Johnson, and for Mr. Robert Lowe was the subject of several email exchanges between the parties’ counsel. On November 12, 2024, Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC wrote to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with copies to Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, and Amy Romine. She proposed two potential 11:00 a.m. deposition times for Mr. Lowe—either December 17 or December 18—and asked whether either date would work for Sarena and Mr. Johnson. In her message, Mary included her contact information and attached the standard confidentiality notice common to Dilbeck & Myers emails.\n\nMary’s message was followed by a thread in which Sarena Tuttle, who is a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, acknowledged the communication on November 7, 2024 with “Thank you so much,” and signed her messages with her updated contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating this is her new email address.\n\nEarlier on November 7, 2024, Mary had responded to Sarena by saying she would ask Mr. Lowe what dates he had available at that time. In a prior exchange on the same day, Sarena had written that if anything caused a delay in the Plaintiff’s deposition, Bryce and Aaron would not have enough time to complete their depositions within business hours, and she suggested looking at additional dates with a start time of 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., due to concerns about finishing within business hours, the holiday season, and unpredictable weather.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, Mary stated that she usually expected the depositions to take 1 to 1.5 hours, and proposed starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 p.m. to be safe, noting that because the deposition would be conducted via Zoom, it would be easier to have a short break between the two depositions. She asked whether that arrangement would work for the other party and the client. Mary also reiterated her preference for Zoom, though she was willing to appear in person if that was the other party’s preference.\n\nThe thread also reveals an earlier back-and-forth beginning in October 2024. On October 23, 2024, Sarena requested dates for Mr. Lowe’s deposition, noting that Bryce had previously followed up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the Plaintiff’s Discovery Request and that they had not yet received any dates for deposition. On October 28, 2024, Sarena reiterated the urgency of obtaining dates before the holidays, asking Mary to provide deposition dates as soon as possible given the approaching holiday calendar. This followed an earlier note from September 25, 2024, in which Bryce had sent an email following up on Mr. Lowe’s responses to the Plaintiff’s Discovery Request and had requested dates for Mr. Lowe’s availability for deposition in the following month.\n\nWithin the November 4, 2024 portion of the thread, Mary had proposed a plan for November 26: Mr. Lowe was said to be available after 2:00 p.m.; Mary suggested that Mr. Johnson could be deposed at 1:00 p.m. and Mr. Lowe could be deposed afterward, to avoid extending the day too late. She also stated a preference for Zoom but indicated willingness to appear in person if that was the other side’s preference. In response, on November 4, 2024 at 2:38 p.m., Sarena replied that November 26 via Zoom was perfectly fine and asked Mary to confirm whether starting Mr. Johnson at 1:00 p.m. and scheduling Mr. Lowe after 2:00 p.m. would be acceptable, given the plan for a one-hour deposition for Mr. Johnson starting at 1:00 p.m.\n\nThe overall record reflects a continuing effort to coordinate deposition dates for Mr. Johnson and Mr. Lowe, with multiple proposed times and formats (Zoom preferred, with a willingness to appear in person), an emphasis on avoiding overly long days, a preference to complete depositions within typical business hours, and consideration of the holiday season and weather. The parties’ contact details are as follows: Mary S. Johnson’s address is 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222, with telephone 502-595-6500 and fax 502-595-6504. Sarena Tuttle’s information lists The Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line 502-357-9971, office line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address). Mary’s messages throughout the thread include confidentiality notices stating that the electronic transmission is for the named recipient and privileged or confidential, and instructing the recipient to delete and notify the sender if received in error.\n\nIn sum, the parties and counsel have been actively coordinating the scheduling of depositions for Mr. Charles Johnson and Mr. Robert Lowe in the Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475 case, with proposed dates in late November and December 2024, a preference for Zoom, stated deposition lengths of roughly one hour for Mr. Johnson and up to one-and-a-half hours for Mr. Lowe, and a plan to place the two depositions on the same day if feasible, while remaining mindful of calendar constraints and weather considerations.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe, Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475, the parties were coordinating the deposition schedule for the two individuals involved in the case: Mr. Charles T. Johnson and Mr. Robert Lowe. The client is Charles T. Johnson, and the case is identified as Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475. The scheduling communications occurred between The Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, with collaboration among several members of both teams.\n\nOn October 28, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Mary S. Johnson at Dilbeck & Myers, with Bryce Koon, Aaron Whaley, and Amy Romine CC’d. The message began with “Good afternoon Mrs. Johnson,” and stated that dates to depose Mr. Lowe had been requested on several occasions over the prior 30 days, but “to date, we still have” [text cut off]. The email was part of an ongoing effort to secure deposition dates for Mr. Lowe.\n\nA follow-up exchange continued in early November. On November 4, 2024, Sarena replied with a short expression of thanks: “Thank you so much.” That same afternoon, Mary Johnson replied that Mr. Lowe was available on November 26 after 2:00 p.m., and suggested scheduling Mr. Johnson for a 1:00 p.m. deposition and then Mr. Lowe afterwards so the session would not run too late. She indicated a preference for Zoom, though she was willing to appear in person if that was the other party’s preference.\n\nLater that same day, November 4, Mary proposed that arrangement, and on November 7, 2024 at 10:03 a.m. she stated that she typically expects each deposition to last 1 to 1.5 hours, so they could start Mr. Lowe at 2:30 p.m. to be safe and, since the depositions would be conducted via Zoom, suggested a brief break between the two sessions to keep within reasonable hours. In response, Sarena wrote on November 7 at 10:08 a.m. that this plan would not work, expressing concern that if anything delayed the Plaintiff’s deposition, Bryce and Aaron would not have enough time to complete their deposition within business hours. She noted the desire to avoid scheduling so close to the wire, especially during the holiday season and given unpredictable weather, and proposed looking at additional dates with a start time of 10:00–11:00 a.m. instead.\n\nMary followed up on November 7 at 10:11 a.m. by saying she would ask Mr. Lowe what he had available at that time. Sarena replied with a brief “Thank you so much” at 10:19 a.m., and the back-and-forth continued as the teams explored alternative time windows.\n\nBy November 12, 2024, Mary suggested that Mr. Lowe could do an 11:00 a.m. deposition on December 17 or December 18, and asked whether either date would work for Mr. Johnson as well. In response later that same day, Sarena confirmed that December 17, 2024 starting at 11:00 a.m. via Zoom would work perfectly, and she stated she would finalize the date and get it on the calendar. She closed with thanks and provided her contact details.\n\nThus, after multiple exchanges and scheduling considerations—balancing preferred times, the duration of each deposition (approximately 1–1.5 hours for Mr. Johnson, with the possibility of back-to-back sessions for Mr. Lowe), and the realities of Zoom versus in-person proceedings—the deposition was set for December 17, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. via Zoom. The parties intended to finalize and place the date on the calendar accordingly.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. Client: Charles T Johnson. This concerns Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe in Jefferson Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-002475.\n\nIn November 2024, scheduling discussions were exchanged between Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC (attorneys for Mr. Johnson) and The Whaley Law Firm (attorneys for Mr. Lowe) regarding the deposition of Charles Johnson and of Mr. Lowe in the Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475 matter. The thread began with an email from Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers on November 4, 2024. She proposed that Mr. Lowe be deposed after 2:00 PM on November 26, 2024, and that Mr. Johnson be deposed at 1:00 PM the same day, noting a preference for Zoom but offering to appear in person if that was the other side’s preference. She also indicated that she usually schedules depositions to run about 1 to 1.5 hours, and she suggested starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 PM to be safe so there would be a bit of a break between the two zoom depositions.\n\nOn November 7, 2024, Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm responded, thanking Mary. In a subsequent chain, Mary replied that she would ask Mr. Lowe what he had available at that time. Later on November 7, Sarena replied that if anything should delay the Plaintiff’s deposition, Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley would not have enough time to complete their deposition within business hours. She expressed concern about scheduling something so close to the wire, especially during the holiday season and given unpredictable weather, and suggested looking at additional dates when there was a 10:00–11:00 AM start time available.\n\nAlso on November 7, 2024, Mary indicated that she usually takes 1–1.5 hours for a deposition and reiterated the 2:30 PM start for Mr. Lowe to be safe. The exchange included standard signatures for both sides with their addresses and contact information.\n\nOn November 12, 2024, Mary asked, “Would you want to do Mr. Johnson at 9:30? And we are doing Zoom, correct?” She provided her contact details and again included the confidentiality notice that accompanies Dilbeck & Myers emails. In response, Sarena noted that December 17, 2024, starting at 11:00 AM via Zoom would work perfectly and that she would get this finalized and on the calendar.\n\nLater that same day, November 12, 2024, Mary wrote back: “Ok… he can do 11 am on Dec 17th or 18th. Would either of those work for you and Mr. Johnson?” She again provided her office address, phone, fax, and new email address in her signature.\n\nThe thread confirms that the parties settled on December 17, 2024 at 11:00 AM via Zoom as a viable deposition slot, with the option of December 18, 2024 if needed. Sarena stated that the December 17 slot via Zoom “works perfectly” and that she would finalize and place it on the calendar. The communications include the usual confidentiality notices and detailed contact information for the involved lawyers, as well as a record of the evolving scheduling considerations and preferences (Zoom preferred, potential conflicts with back-to-back depositions, and the desire to avoid delays during the holiday season and inclement weather).",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023\nClient: Charles T Johnson\n\nIn the matter of Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe, Jeff Cir 24-CI-002475, the Whaley Law Firm and Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC coordinated deposition scheduling for the plaintiff, Charles T. Johnson, in a motor vehicle accident case dated April 18, 2023. The communication thread began with scheduling efforts for a deposition via Zoom, with the parties considering a December 2024 date and aiming to allocate sufficient time for all participants.\n\nOn November 4, 2024, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, indicated that November 26, 2024, via Zoom, would be perfectly fine starting at 1:00 p.m. for a one-hour deposition of Mr. Johnson. She also noted her new email address. Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers replied that she would check with Mr. Lowe about availability.\n\nTwo days later, on November 7, 2024, Mary suggested starting Mr. Lowe at 2:30 p.m. to provide a safer buffer, since she typically takes 1 to 1.5 hours for a deposition and the sessions would be conducted by Zoom with a break between the two. Sarena replied that scheduling something so close to the wire could leave Bryce Koon and Aaron Whaley with insufficient time to complete their depositions within business hours, especially given the holiday season and unpredictable weather. She proposed looking at additional dates with a start window of 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. for better scheduling flexibility. Mary agreed to check Mr. Lowe’s availability at that time.\n\nOn November 12, 2024, Mary proposed that Mr. Lowe could do 11:00 a.m. on December 17th or 18th. Later that same day, Sarena confirmed that December 17, 2024, starting at 11:00 a.m. via Zoom, would work perfectly and that she would finalize the arrangement and place it on the calendar. Mary then asked again about a potential 9:30 a.m. start for Mr. Johnson and confirmed that the deposition would be conducted via Zoom. In response, Sarena reaffirmed that December 17, 2024, at 11:00 a.m. via Zoom would work, and she would proceed to finalize the scheduling.\n\nSignatures and contact details relevant to the correspondents appeared in the exchanges: Sarena M. Tuttle, listed as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with address 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting a new email address). Mary S. Johnson’s contact information was listed as 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, KY 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. The exchanges repeatedly carried standard confidentiality notices typical of electronic communications between the named parties.\n\nIn summary, after a series of scheduling discussions in early November 2024, the plan was finalized for the deposition of Mr. Charles Johnson on December 17, 2024, at 11:00 a.m., to be conducted via Zoom, with the calendar to be updated accordingly.",

      "natural_language": "The Charles T. Johnson motor vehicle accident matter against Robert Lowe, Jefferson County case 24-CI-002475, involves the client Charles T. Johnson in a dispute arising from the April 18, 2023 incident. The case file for this matter is tracked under the name Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023, and the communications below reflect negotiations and settlement discussions between counsel.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Mary S. Johnson of Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, regarding the Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe matter. In his message, Bryce suggested exploring mediation for the case, noting that while the firm was prepared to continue litigating, mediation might still be productive. He asked Mary to share her thoughts on mediation, and he offered to discuss logistics and potential mediators if there was interest. The email was addressed to Mary with cc’s to the Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 Filevine project email address and to Sarena Tuttle, and it included The Whaley Law Firm’s standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nMary S. Johnson responded to Bryce on May 9, 2025, around 12:20 PM. She indicated that she is generally open to mediation but prefers to attempt informal negotiations first to see if a settlement is possible. She noted that the parties have opposing views of liability, which would likely pose a stumbling block. She suggested that if Mr. Johnson does not expect the settlement to be reflective of a liability assessment in his favor, they might be able to reach a resolution without mediation to save him money on the settlement. She asked Bryce for his thoughts on this approach and whether mediation should be pursued, given the potential liability disagreement. Mary included her contact details: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone 502-595-6500; fax 502-595-6504. Her message also carried the standard privileged-notice language common to such communications.\n\nBryce Koon replied to Mary on May 9, 2025 at 12:44:33 PM (GMT-04:00). He acknowledged her response, stating, “Understood. Thank you for getting back to me.” He said he would talk with his client early the following week and would attempt to provide a demand shortly thereafter. His signature followed, along with The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and his contact information (phone 502-365-5043, fax 502-237-3207). The reply, like prior messages, contained the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Charles-T-Johnson-MVA-4-18-2023. The client is Charles T. Johnson, involved in a motor vehicle accident case alleged against Robert Lowe, docketed in Jefferson County as 24-CI-002475.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, at 10:35:21 a.m. Eastern Time, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to counsel for the opposing side regarding Charles Johnson v. Robert Lowe (Jefferson 24-CI-002475). The subject line mirrored the case caption. In the body of the message, Koon stated that he had discussed the matter with his client and wanted to follow up to see whether the opposing counsel had an offer in light of a prior email. He signed as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and listed the firm’s phone number as (502) 365-5043 and fax as (502) 237-3207. The message was sent to Mary S. Johnson at Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC, with a Filevine Project email address included in the cc line: Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address, CharlesJohnsonZ3709312@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and included cc to the case file for visibility. The email contained the customary attorney‑client privilege disclaimer stating the message was intended only for the named recipient and that improper receipt should be reported; it advised no waiver of privilege and instructed not to use or forward the information.\n\nEarlier, on April 29, 2025, at 2:28 PM, Bryce Koon had emailed Mary S. Johnson regarding the same matter. In that message, he wrote to inquire whether the opposing party would be open to exploring mediation. He acknowledged that both sides were prepared to proceed with litigation but suggested mediation might be productive. He invited Mary to share her thoughts and, if there was interest, to discuss logistics and potential mediators. This message also carried the standard confidentiality and privilege notice and was cc’d to the same Filevine project email address for the Charles Johnson MVA 4/18/2023 file and to Sarena Tuttle, with the Whaley Law Firm again listed as the sender and The Whaley Law Firm’s contact details included in the signature.\n\nMary S. Johnson replied on May 9, 2025, at about 12:20 p.m. She indicated she was always open to mediation but preferred attempting informal negotiations first to see if a settlement was possible. She noted that the parties likely held opposite views of liability, which would present a stumbling block. However, she suggested that if Mr. Johnson did not expect a settlement reflecting a liability determination in his favor, it might be possible to resolve the matter without mediation to save on settlement costs. She asked for thoughts on whether to pursue informal negotiations first rather than mediation. Her message included her contact information: 8005 Lyndon Centre Way, Suite 201, Louisville, Kentucky 40222; phone (502) 595-6500; fax (502) 595-6504. As with the other emails, a confidentiality disclaimer noted that the transmission was for the named recipient and warned against unauthorized copying or forwarding, with instructions to delete and notify if received in error and to contact Dilbeck & Myers, PLLC at (502) 595-6500 to correct any address record.\n\nIn summary, the communication history in this case comprises an April 29, 2025 mediation outreach from W. Bryce Koon to Mary S. Johnson, proposing mediation as a productive path while acknowledging ongoing litigation, followed by a May 9, 2025 response from Mary Johnson advocating initial informal negotiations due to likely liability disagreements, and a July 21, 2025 follow-up from Bryce Koon asking whether there was any offer in light of the prior exchange. All messages included standard privilege and confidentiality notices and were cc’d to the relevant Filevine project address and participants.",
