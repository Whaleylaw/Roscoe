      "natural_language": "In the Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023 case for client Julmonzhae Moore, the Whaley Law Firm team exchanged emails on October 11, 2023 regarding payment directions for medical bills related to the Julmonzhae Moore file (054658453-03). The first line of note shows a directive from Aaron Whaley: \u201cstop paying if the payment is against our original direction.\u201d\n\nOver the course of the afternoon, Jessa Galosmo sent several replies and questions. Around 12:40 PM, Jessa wrote: \u201cHi Atty. Whaley, Bills from Starlight Chiropractic went over $6000. Can we release reservations to continue payment to Starlight?\u201d Later, at about 12:43 PM, Aaron responded: \u201cNo, we have too many other bills.\u201d Then, at roughly 12:53 PM, Jessa followed up: \u201cThe current bill they released for payment went over $10. Is it okay? or should we instruct them to stop pay the check since payments over $6,000.\u201d The chain shows a final entry from Aaron at about 1:02 PM reiterating the initial instruction: \u201cstop paying if the payment is against our original direction.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the thread, there was a forward from Lisa Rivera dated around 12:35 PM. Rivera, identified as a Claim Resolution Specialist NF II with USRM Medical Claims, wrote to Jessa: \u201cHello Jessa, Please send updated Direction to pay and let me know if I need to stop pay the check since payments over $6,000.\u201d The forwarded message also included Rivera\u2019s signature block with full contact details for Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, including mailing and shipping addresses (USPS Mail Only: Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, PO Box 5014, Scranton, PA 18505-5014; FedEx/UPS: Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, 19 Bret Collins Drive, Throop, PA 18512), direct dial and toll-free numbers, and a fax number, along with business hours (Monday to Friday, 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM EST). Rivera\u2019s message also provided medical provider billing support contact information (Phone: 855-677-2891; Email: LibertyPCC@mitchell.com) and the submission email/address for bills (imaging@libertymutual.com or PO Box 5014 Scranton, PA 18505-5014). The message also promoted two-way text claim updates and suggested submitting claims online for faster processing, with privacy policy and online-claims guidance included.\n\nIn their closing lines, the messages from Jessa and Aaron included the standard firm signatures, with Jessa listing Whaley Law Firm contact details (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363) and Aaron noting his address (Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; 502-583-4022).\n\nIn summary, the file shows an ongoing internal discussion about payment directions for medical bills tied to Julmonzhae Moore\u2019s MVA, with a focus on whether to halt payments when bills exceeded certain thresholds (notably $6,000), and a request from Lisa Rivera to update the payment directions and confirm if a stop-payment is required when payments surpass $6,000. The exchange also contains the usual administrative details and contact information related to Liberty Mutual/Safeco Claims and the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s correspondence.",

The case file includes an email chain dated October 11, 2023, involving Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm and Aaron Whaley, with Julmonzhae Moore and related parties copied. The initial response from Jessa, sent at 14:14:25 in the afternoon, simply stated \u201cGot it.\u201d\n\nThe discussion on that day centers on whether to continue paying bills tied to the medical-claims directive. At approximately 1:02 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote: \u201cstop paying if the payment is against our original direction.\u201d Earlier, at 12:53 PM, Jessa asked whether the current bill released for payment, which had exceeded $10, was permissible or whether they should instruct the payee to stop payment on the check because payments over $6,000 were at issue. At 12:43 PM, Aaron responded: \u201cNo, we have too many other bills.\u201d Then, at 12:40 PM, Jessa queried: \u201cHi Atty. Whaley, Bills from Starlight Chiropractic went over $6000. Can we release reservations to continue payment to Starlight?\u201d\n\nThe thread includes a forwarded message from Lisa Rivera dated October 11, 2023 at 12:35 PM, with the subject \u201cJulmonzhae Moore 054658453-03.\u201d In that message, Lisa Rivera, a Claim Resolution Specialist NF II with USRM Medical Claims, asked Jessa to \u201cPlease send updated Direction to pay and let me know if I need to stop pay the check since payments over $6,000.\u201d Rivera also provided extensive contact information for Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, including postal and FedEx/UPS addresses, direct dial, toll-free numbers, a fax number, and business hours. The USPS Mail address was Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, PO Box 5014, Scranton, PA 18505-5014, and the FedEx/UPS address was Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, 19 Bret Collins Drive, Throop, PA 18512. Direct Dial: 856-355-7644; Toll Free: 800-2Claims; Fax: 888-268-8840; Business Hours: Monday to Friday 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM EST. Medical Provider Billing Support could be reached at 855-677-2891, with email LibertyPCC@mitchell.com, and bills could be submitted to imaging@libertymutual.com or to PO Box 5014 Scranton, PA 18505-5014. Rivera added a note promoting two-way text updates: \u201cGreat news!!! You can now chat with me for claim updates via 2 way text message. Click here to send me an email to opt in. Please include your claim number and the best number to reach you via text.\u201d She also referenced Liberty Mutual\u2019s privacy policy at www.libertymutual.com/privacy and encouraged faster processing by filing new claims online at Liberty Mutual or Safeco and managing claims at LibertyMutual.com/online-claims or Safeco.com/online-claims.\n\nIn closing, the exchange included sign-offs from Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm, including her phone and fax numbers (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363), followed by a signature block for Aaron Whaley with the Whaley Law Firm address (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222) and phone number (502-583-4022). The thread ends with reiterations of \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo\u201d and contact details for the Whaley Law Firm (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363).",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nIn a forwarded exchange dated December 18, 2023, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm forwarded an email from Robert Elliott regarding Claim 054658453-01 / Julmonzhae Moore. Elliott\u2019s message states that the law firm has received a time limit demand package dated December 15, 2023 and is requesting an open extension to the demand. The reason given for seeking an open extension is the number of claimants asserting injuries in relation to the available liability bodily injury limits of $25,000.00 per person / $50,000.00 total. Elliott notes that on November 10, 2023, his office had informed the recipient of the potential insufficiency of limits due to the number of claimants. As of that time, medical documentation had not been received for the remaining claimants: Ashlee Williams, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham. Elliott asks for a prompt response. The message is signed \u201cRobert Elliott,\u201d with the contact phone number 317-805-2841. The forwarded content also includes metadata: Claim-Number 054658453; Exposure-Number 01; Category Manual Outbound E-Mail; Description undefined; Template-Id BIFREEFORM. The message also notes that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the standard copyright and address for Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.\n\nThe December 18, 2023 forwarding accompanies an earlier message from Robert Elliott dated November 10, 2023 at 10:02 AM. In that email, Elliott addresses Scott at Stout & Heuke Law, Jessa Galosmo, and lgraham@kpattorney.com, and is titled Claim#:054658453-01 / Julmonzhae Moore - Daquan Graham - Naomi Robinson. Elliott explains that each of the listed firms represents a party making an injury claim arising from the August 29, 2023 auto accident. The claimants and their respective firms are: Daquan Graham represented by Stout & Heuke; Julmonzhae Moore represented by Whaley Law Firm (spelled in the message as Julzmonzhae Moore); Naomi Robinson represented by Kanter & Pintaluga. Elliott informs that the insured, Dewayne Ward, carries Liability Bodily Injury limits of $25,000 / $50,000, and asks that all medical bills and records be forwarded at the earliest convenience. He also requests permission to review each client\u2019s PIP file documents and invites any questions or concerns. The message closes with Elliott\u2019s signature and contact information (317-805-2841), followed by the policy note that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company. The communication ends with the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s sign-off: \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo,\u201d along with the firm\u2019s phone and fax numbers (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363).

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nOn November 10, 2023, Robert Elliott wrote to Scott at Stout & Heuke, Jessa Galosmo, and L. Graham at kpattorney.com regarding the Claim#: 054658453-01 involving Julmonzhae Moore, Daquan Graham, and Naomi Robinson. In that message, Elliott explained that each of the firms represents a party making an injury claim stemming from the August 29, 2023 auto accident. He identified the representations as follows: Stout & Heuke represents Daquan Graham; Whaley Law Firm represents Julmonzhae Moore and Ashlee Williams; Kanter & Pintaluga represents Naomi Robinson. He advised that their insured, Dewayne Ward, carried Liability Bodily Injury limits of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per occurrence, and requested that any and all medical bills and records be forwarded at the recipients\u2019 earliest convenience. He also asked whether his office had permission to review the clients\u2019 PIP file documents. Elliott signed off with his contact information: Robert Elliott, 317-805-2841. The message noted that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, and it carried the corporate address Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116.\n\nElliott\u2019s November 10, 2023 email was part of an ongoing thread later forwarded on December 18, 2023. In the December 18 forwarding, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm titled the email \u201cFW: Claim#:054658453-01 / Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams\u201d and included the earlier correspondence. The body of Elliott\u2019s December 18 note stated: \u201cHello, Please be advised, we have received a policy limit demand form the attorney\u2019s office representing Julzmonzhae Moore. On 11/20/2023, we informed your offices that the insured, Dewayne Ward, carried liability limits of $25,000 / $50,000.

It reaffirmed that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the copyright notice from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116.\n\nThe forwarded notes also reflect that the November 10, 2023 message described the same three-party representation and requested medical bills and records as well as permission to review PIP file documents, reiterating Elliott\u2019s instruction to forward medical documentation and to contact with questions.

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nThis note chronicles the claim communications surrounding the August 29, 2023 motor vehicle accident, involving four claimants and the insurance policy administered by Liberty Mutual. The policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with liability limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence. The insured is Dewayne Ward. The four claimants referenced in the communications are Julmonzhae Moore (Whaley Law Firm), Daquan Graham (Stout & Heuke), Naomi Robinson (Kanter & Pintaluga), and Ashlee Williams (as identified in the exchanges). The claim number assigned is 054658453-01, with an exposure number of 01.\n\nThe first relevant communications in this chain occurred on November 10, 2023. Robert Elliott of Liberty Mutual sent an email to Stout & Heuke (attorney Scott), Jessa Galosmo (Whaley Law Firm), and L. Graham (kpattorney.com) regarding the case. In the email, Elliott explained that four parties are making injury claims stemming from the 8/29/2023 auto accident, and that Liberty Mutual would need medical bills and records for all claimants in order to determine how the available limits of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per occurrence should be distributed. He noted that the insurer had informed all representatives for the injured parties of the available limits and the need for bills and records, and he invited the recipients to contact him with any questions. The message closed with Elliott\u2019s signature block, including his phone number, and a note that the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the standard corporate footer.\n\nIn the same November 10, 2023 exchange, Elliott\u2019s message was part of a broader thread that listed the three firms representing the other claimants: Stout & Heuke for Daquan Graham; Whaley Law Firm for Julmonzhae Moore; and Kanter & Pintaluga for Naomi Robinson. Elliott requested the forwarding of medical bills and records for all claimants and asked whether he could review the claimants\u2019 PIP file documents. The email concluded with a formal closing from Elliott and the Whaley Law Firm contact information.\n\nSubsequent messages in December continued to address the same issue of limits and documentation. On December 18, 2023, Elliott wrote that Liberty Mutual had received the time-limit demand package dated December 15, 2023 and was requesting an open extension to the demand due to the number of claimants relative to the available liability limits. He noted that, as of November 10, 2023, Liberty Mutual had informed the office of the potential insufficiency of limits given the number of claimants and reported that medical documentation had not yet been received for the remaining claimants Ashlee Williams, Naomi Robinson, and Daquan Graham. He asked for a prompt response.\n\nOn December 19, 2023, at 12:16 PM, Jessa Galosmo replied to Elliott, indicating a desire to resolve the matter before the holiday. Elliott followed up later that day, at 12:28 PM, reiterating that Liberty Mutual had received the time-limit demand package dated 12/15/2023 and stating that they were seeking the open extension due to multiple claimants and the limits of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per occurrence. He asked whether medical documentation for all claimants had been obtained and whether his office had been in contact with the other claimants\u2019 attorneys to determine their progress in gathering medical records.\n\nThe thread continued on December 26, 2023, with Elliott stating that Liberty Mutual could neither reject nor accept the demand dated December 15, 2023 at that time, given there are four injured parties. He explained that bills and records for all parties were needed to determine how the available limits would be distributed and noted that Liberty Mutual had advised all representatives of the available limits and the need for bills and records. He urged contact for any questions or concerns.\n\nOn December 27, 2023, Jessa Galosmo forwarded Elliott\u2019s December 26, 2023 message to Julmonzhae Moore and to the filevine app address associated with the case, carrying the subject line \u201cFwd: Claim#:054658453-01 / Julmonzhae Moore.\u201d The forwarded message reiterated the same point: with four claimants, the available limits are $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence, and the parties must provide medical bills and records for all claimants to determine the distribution of the available limits. The forwarded note indicated the policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, included the standard corporate footer, and ended with Jessa\u2019s customary sign-off and contact information for Whaley Law Firm (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363).\n\nIn sum, the case involves four injury claims arising from the 8/29/2023 accident, with Liberty Mutual acknowledging the four claimants and the policy limits of $25,000 per person / $50,000 per occurrence. The insurers require medical bills and records for all claimants to determine how the limited liability coverage should be allocated and have repeatedly asked for documentation, while also seeking permission to review PIP files and coordinating with the claimant attorneys. The most recent communications in December 2023 show Liberty Mutual unable to accept or reject the December 15, 2023 demand until such documentation is provided, and they emphasized the need to resolve the matter before proceeding.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore.\n\nIn January 2024, Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, the insurer handling the case, sent a message to Jessa Galosmo at Whaley Law Firm (and copied others). The message stated that Liberty Mutual had received bodily injury demands for Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, and that the company appeared to have sufficient information to globally tender the available bodily injury policy limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence to the four claimants: Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore. Liberty Mutual asked for the offices representing the claimants to come to an agreement on how the split of the $25,000 per person / $50,000 per occurrence would be allocated among the four claimants. The letter also indicated that, if needed, Liberty Mutual could appoint defense counsel and schedule a mediation. The message was signed by Robert Elliott and provided his contact number, 317-805-2841. The email carried metadata identifying the Claim-Number as 054658453, the Exposure-Number as 01, the Category as Manual Outbound E-Mail, the Description as undefined, and the Template-Id as BIFREEFORM. The policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the company address listed as 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116, and the copyright note for 2024 Liberty Mutual Insurance Company.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, at 9:39 a.m. (noted as 9:39?AM on the forwarded record), Robert Elliott sent a follow-up email to Jessa Galosmo, stating that Liberty Mutual had not yet received a response to the 1/11/2024 email and asking whether the Whaley firm had been in contact with the representatives for the other claimants involved in the 8/29/2023 auto accident. The email was addressed to Jessa Galosmo and referenced the same claim file (Claim#: 054658453-01 / Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore). The follow-up included Elliott\u2019s request for coordination regarding the other claimants.\n\nThe chain of correspondence includes the initial 1/11/2024 message from Robert Elliott to Jessa Galosmo, scott@stoutheukelaw.com, and lgraham@kpattorney.com. In that message, Elliott stated that Liberty Mutual had received bodily injury demands for Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and that there was sufficient information to globally tender the policy limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per occurrence to the four claimants (Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, Julmonzhae Moore). He requested that the offices of the involved attorneys reach an agreement on how to divide the available limits among the four claimants and noted that Liberty Mutual could appoint defense counsel and schedule mediation if needed. The message concluded with Elliott\u2019s signature, \u201cSincerely, Robert Elliott, 317-805-2841.\u201d\n\nThe forwarding attorney, Jessa Galosmo, closed the thread with her note to Atty. Whaley on January 23, 2024 at 11:33:40 a.m., asking, \u201cHi Atty. Whaley, How should I respond here?\u201d The thread also includes the standard closing line from Jessa: \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo, Whaley Law Firm,\u201d followed by her firm\u2019s contact details: Ph: (502)357-9975, Fax: (502)364-9363.",

This matter concerns Claim 054658453-01 involving Daquan Graham, Naomi Robinson, Ashlee Williams, and Julmonzhae Moore. The following communications occurred among counsel: Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, representing Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore, with Scott Stout of Stout & Heuke Law Office, and others including James Kamensky, Lexi Graham, and the claimants.\n\nOn January 23, 2024, Aaron Whaley emailed to propose how to divide Liberty Mutual\u2019s tendered limit of $50,000 among the four people named in the claim. He stated that he represents Ashlee Williams and Julmonzhae Moore and suggested apportioning the settlement using medical bills, asking if anyone had objections. Lexi Graham replied, cc\u2019ing James Kamensky, indicating she had included the handling attorney on the thread. James Kamensky subsequently noted that they were currently gathering medical bills for Naomi Robinson and that, generally, they were comfortable with apportionment based on medical bills, and he would advise once they had them.\n\nIn a follow-up communication on January 31, 2024, Aaron Whaley requested that each side forward the amount of medical bills they had for their respective clients. He reported that Ashlee Williams\u2019 total medical bills were $35,454.24 and Julmonzhae Moore\u2019s were $29,092.40.\n\nBy February 8, 2024, Scott Stout advised that they were gathering bills and records for Daquan Graham as well, and that he did not have a problem dividing the recovery based on medical bills. Then, on February 12, 2024, Stout stated that Daquan Graham\u2019s medical bills totaled $7,195.00.\n\nMost recently, on March 1, 2024, Aaron Whaley followed up to confirm that the last of the medical bills were being collected and to determine whether the only remaining bills were those for Naomi Robinson, with the aim of moving toward resolution of the case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023\nClient: Julmonzhae Moore\n\nThis file documents a series of communications concerning Julmonzhae Moore in relation to the motor vehicle accident case dated 8-29-2023. On November 29, 2023, Lisa Rivera, a Claim Resolution Specialist NF II with USRM Medical Claims, sent an email to Jessa Galosmo at Whaley Law Firm (and copied other firm recipients) with the subject \u201c21d724fc-8d27-4da5-9107-7394e10b2d1c.pdf Julmonzhae Moore 054658453-03.\u201d The message attached the current PIP log and Health Care Lien and asked for updates on three points: \u201cAny new update on you direction to pay?,\u201d \u201cIs your client still treating?,\u201d and \u201cDo you want the HealthCare lien paid?\u201d The email also requested an update and thanked the recipient. Rivera provided full contact and mailing information for Liberty Mutual/Safeco claims, including both USPS and FedEx/UPS addresses, direct dial number (856-355-7644), toll-free number (800-2Claims), and a fax number (888-268-8840). The message also listed the Medical Provider Billing Support line (855-677-2891), the email (LibertyPCC@mitchell.com), and the submission address for bills (imaging@libertymutual.com or PO Box 5014 Scranton, PA 18505-5014). It included an online privacy note and a two-way text update option, inviting the recipient to opt in by emailing to receive claim updates via text and asking to include the claim number and best text-reach number.\n\nA prior version of the same message appears to have been sent on December 1, 2023, with the identical attachments (the current PIP log and Health Care Lien) and identical requests for updates on payment direction, ongoing treatment status of the client, and whether to pay the lien. The USPS/FedEx contact details and the entire set of instructions about submitting bills, privacy policy, and online claim management were included as in the November 29 email.\n\nAn earlier instance of this correspondence is shown from January 9, 2024, again repeating that the attached documents were the current PIP log and Health Care Lien and reiterating the same questions: \u201cAny new update on you direction to pay?,\u201d \u201cIs your client still treating?,\u201d and \u201cDo you want the HealthCare lien paid?\u201d along with the same mailing addresses, contact numbers, and online resources.\n\nOn March 5, 2024, at 16:47 local time, Jessa Galosmo replied to a forwarding chain directed to Greg Whaley, Justin Chumbley, and Bryce Koon with the note: \u201cLet me know if I\u2019ll send direction of payment.\u201d The message then includes a forwarded thread beginning with Lisa Rivera\u2019s communications (the November 29, 2023, December 1, 2023, and January 9, 2024 messages) asking for updates on payment direction, the client\u2019s treatment status, and whether the Healthcare lien should be paid, all with the same attachments and details described above. The forwarded emails reiterate that the attachments are the current PIP log and Health Care Lien and repeat the same contact information and instructions for claim processing and privacy. The chain ends with Jessa\u2019s sign-off from Whaley Law Firm, including her phone and fax numbers.\n\nSign-off: All the best, Jessa Galosmo Whaley Law Firm Ph: (502)357-9975 Fax: (502)364-9363",

The description field is undefined, and the Template-Id is BIFREEFORM. The matter is insured under Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with Liberty Mutual\u2019s address at 175 Berkeley Street, Boston, MA 02116.\n\nThe communications began with a forwarded thread involving Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm and attorney Greg Whaley, concerning an update on the claim and how the settlement amounts should be split among multiple claimants. The forward shows the message chain originated from Jessa Galosmo to Greg Whaley, asking: \u201cHi Atty. Whaley, Julmonzhae Moore is asking for an update. Have you spoken with the offices of the other claimants about how to split the amounts?\u201d The forwarding includes the context that this is in reference to Claim Number 054658453-02.\n\nIn the forwarded portion of the thread, Robert Elliott replied on Friday, August 30, 2024, at approximately 2:02 PM, with the subject line \u201cRE: Claim#:054658453-02.\u201d His message stated: \u201cHello*,* We have made a global tender to all claimants. We are waiting on your office, and the offices for the other claimants, to advise of the split. Please let me know the split amounts and I will send out releases to all parties.

Could you please provide me with the next steps in the process?\u201d She signed off with \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo,\u201d followed by her Whaley Law Firm contact details: Ph: (502)357-9975, Fax: (502)364-9363.

The exchange shows a global tender has been issued to all claimants, and the parties are awaiting guidance on how to allocate the settlement amounts before releases can be issued. The document also reinforces that the case is handled in the context of Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company\u2019s coverage.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore. This matter concerns Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd County, case number Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157).\n\nOn May 5, 2025, at 12:25 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email regarding the Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson case. The message was addressed to Dennis Cantrell and Zachary Reichle, with copies to Sarena Tuttle and the three Filevine project email addresses for Ashlee Williams (MVA 8/29/23), Dewayne Ward (MVA 8/29/23), and Julmonzhae Moore (MVA 8/29/23), as well as Janet Weile. The subject of the email was Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157). In the body, Koon advised that Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery, along with the associated notice filed that day, was attached, and that a Word copy was included for convenience. He invited any questions and provided his contact details, including The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone number (502) 365-5043, and fax number (502) 237-3207. The message bore the standard confidentiality notice typical of the firm: it stated that the electronic message was intended only for the named recipient and could contain attorney-client privileged or otherwise protected information; if received in error, the recipient was instructed to contact The Whaley Law Firm and advised that there was no waiver of privilege and that the information should not be used or forwarded to anyone not intended to receive it. The message also contained an image placeholder noting that an image had been removed by the sender.\n\nIn a subsequent exchange on May 19, 2025, at approximately 10:08 AM, Zachary Reichle of Stoll Keenon Ogden LLP wrote to counsel requesting a thirty-day extension to finalize Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. He noted that the current due date was June 4 and explained that with an additional thirty days the due date would be July 7. He clarified that June 4 plus thirty days would land on July 4, which was a weekend, and that the two following days were the weekend, thus the July 7 date. The message closed with thanks and Reichle\u2019s contact information: Direct line 317.224.2473; firm address at 334 N Senate Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46204; and additional firm locations in Louisville, Lexington, Indianapolis, Evansville, Frankfort, and Jeffersonville. The email carried SKO\u2019s confidentiality notice, which stated that the message was for the sole use of the recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information, with prohibitions on unauthorized review, use, or disclosure and instructions to contact the sender and destroy copies if the recipient was not the intended one.\n\nLater on May 19, 2025, at 1:43:26 PM (GMT-04:00), Bryce Koon responded to counsel with a reply stating that July 7th was fine with him and that if there was anything else needed, they should let him know. This message included Koon\u2019s confirmation and his standard signature block, reiterating his firm\u2019s contact information and location, as well as a confidentiality notice affirming the intended recipient and the privileged nature of the content, along with instructions if the message was received in error.\n\nThroughout these communications, the parties maintained standard confidentiality and privilege language typical of attorney correspondence, and the emails referenced the attached discovery documents and the request for a discovery-response extension.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023\nClient: Julmonzhae Moore\n\nIn the matter titled Willaims, Ward & Moore v. Robinson, counsel at The Whaley Law Firm was copied on an April\u2013June 2025 discovery exchange concerning the plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore, among others. On June 9, 2025, Lesly Torres, a paralegal, sent counsel copies of the discovery requests that had been served in the above-referenced matter, in both Word and PDF formats. The requests included six items: (1) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams; (2) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Ashlee Williams; (3) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore; (4) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Julmonzhae Moore; (5) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward; and (6) Defendant Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Plaintiff Dewayne Ward. The message indicated that these requests were served today in the referenced matter. The communication was directed to bryce@whaleylawfirm.com, with copies to Zachary Reichle of Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC and Janet Weile, among others, and signaled that the email was from Indianapolis. Lesly Torres provided direct contact at 317.61.4224.\n\nOn July 15, 2025, Zachary Reichle, an Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, followed up with counsel regarding the status of Plaintiffs\u2019 responses to Defendant\u2019s discovery requests. He noted that the responses were originally due July 9, but that no responses had been received and no extensions of time had been requested. His message included his direct line (317.224.2473) and firm contact information, and carried the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice.\n\nThen, on July 28, 2025, a forwarded email from Bryce Koon at The Whaley Law Firm notified counsel that Plaintiffs\u2019 Discovery Responses had been attached, and it provided a Dropbox link for the document production: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/f27jsukejdzuxesqz496o/AOngUDwjYgN8Y2nRHEIpqrU?rlkey=fje64jsp5o4uw5m4tasky5vw7&st=q3oemih1&dl=0. In the forwarded message, Koon stated, \u201cGood morning counsel, Attached please find Plaintiffs' Discovery Responses. Below you will find a Dropbox link to the document production in this regard.\u201d The email was sent to Zachary Reichle, with copies to Lesly Torres, Dennis Cantrell (Dennis.Cantrell@skofirm.com), and Janet Weile. The Whaley Law Firm signature block followed, listing 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-365-5043, and fax 502-237-3207, and included the firm\u2019s confidentiality notice. The forwarded message also contained the prior June 9, 2025 email from Lesly Torres (as described above), which had stated that the six discovery requests had been served and included the same six items listed in June.\n\nFor completeness, the June 9, 2025 communication from Lesly Torres to Bryce Koon (cc\u2019d to Zachary Reichle, Dennis Cantrell, and Janet Weile) summarized that the following discovery requests were served that day in the Williams, Ward & Moore v. Robinson matter: (1) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Ashlee Williams; (2) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Ashlee Williams; (3) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Julmonzhae Moore; (4) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Julmonzhae Moore; (5) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Request for Production of Documents to Dewayne Ward; and (6) Naomi Robinson\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories to Dewayne Ward. The message invited any questions and was signed by Lesly Torres, Paralegal, with direct contact details and the Indianapolis location.",

      "natural_language": "The case at hand is Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd County case number 22D03-2501-CT-000157), with the focus file listed as Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023 for client Julmonzhae Moore. The plaintiffs are Ashlee Williams, Dewayne Ward, and Julmonzhae Moore, each noted with an MVA date of 8/29/23. The correspondence involves counsel from The Whaley Law Firm and Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, and the communications were circulated among Bryce Koon, Esq. (The Whaley Law Firm), Zachary Reichle, Esq. (Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC), with copies to Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, and Janet Weile.\n\nIn May 2025, the matter progressed through discovery and scheduling discussions. On May 5, 2025, Bryce Koon emailed counsel with the subject Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157), attaching Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery along with the associated notice filed that day. He noted that a Word copy was included for convenience and invited any questions. The message carried the standard attorney-client confidentiality notice.\n\nA follow-up exchange occurred on May 19, 2025. In a message dated May 19, 2025 at 1:43 PM, Bryce Koon replied, signaling that July 7th was acceptable for whatever had been requested and offering to provide any additional information as needed. He closed with his customary contact information for The Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with a phone number of (502) 365-5043 and a fax number of (502) 237-3207.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:08 AM, Zachary Reichle sent a separate email asking for an extension of time to finalize Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests. He proposed adding thirty days to the current due date of June 4, noting that the new due date would be July 7, since July 4 fell on a weekend and the following two days were weekend days. He signed as an Associate of Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC and provided his direct contact information: 317-224-2473. His message included the firm\u2019s disclaimer about confidentiality and privilege. The email chain also identified the recipients and cc\u2019d individuals, including Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023\u2014Filevine Project Email Address, and Janet Weile.\n\nSubsequently, Bryce Koon again communicated on May 19, 2025 with the subject line specific to the Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson matter. He reaffirmed that July 7th would be fine and invited any further needs. The email continued to carry the same firm details for The Whaley Law Firm and the same Louisville address and contact numbers.\n\nThe email thread also shows an earlier May 5, 2025 message from Bryce Koon, which transmitted Plaintiffs\u2019 First Set of Discovery along with the notice, as mentioned above, and stated that a Word copy was included for convenience. This message again carried the confidentiality notice and established the initial discovery exchange.\n\nMoving forward to October 2025, the parties resumed discussions about depositions and mediation. On October 17, 2025, Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC (the recipient in this thread), wrote to counsel to request the deposition availability of Plaintiffs in November or December. He also reminded that there is a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026, and noted that the parties had (at a prior Case Management Conference on July 29, 2025) agreed upon Larry Church as mediator. He proposed reaching out to Larry Church\u2019s office to determine availability. Reichle explained that the firm\u2019s calendar was booked through January and early February of the following year, so mediation would likely occur in late February or March. He observed that the Court would probably not be troubled by this timing given that trial was not set to occur until December 2026, but he wanted to provide advance notice. His message included his direct line at 317-224-2473 and the firm\u2019s broader contact details, along with the confidentiality notice customary to such correspondence.\n\nIn response, on October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon, writing for The Whaley Law Firm, informed counsel that his clients were available for depositions on any date between November 3 and November 7 and asked that if any of those dates worked, they should be confirmed so arrangements could be scheduled. He reiterated the same contact information for the firm and included the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nThroughout the thread, the correspondence indicates that the deposition scheduling, discovery responses, and mediation planning were being coordinated among the same set of principals: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., for the plaintiffs (The Whaley Law Firm), and Zachary Reichle, Esq., for the defense (Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC), with multiple copies to involved individuals associated with the three plaintiffs in the MVA group and their Filevine project communications. The communications were conducted with formalities typical of civil practice, including attachments (discovery sets and Word copies), notices, proposed deposition windows, and mediation timing aligned with a Case Management Conference held in July 2025. The parties continue to coordinate around depositions in early November 2025 and a mediation window in early 2026, with the understanding that trial in this matter is not scheduled until December 2026. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office remains at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the parties\u2019 communications carry the standard confidentiality disclaimers.",

The email correspondence runs between The Whaley Law Firm and Skofirm, with copies to Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA, Dewayne Ward MVA, Julmonzhae Moore MVA, and Janet Weile. The dated thread begins in May 2025 and continues through October 2025, outlining deposition scheduling for the plaintiffs and a related mediation plan.\n\nOn May 19, 2025, Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, replied to Zachary Reichle, Esq., of Skofirm, with the message that July 7th was fine and that he would let Zach know if anything else was needed. The email was CC\u2019d to Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/23, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/23, and Janet Weile, and it carried a standard attorney-client privilege notice at the bottom.\n\nOn October 17, 2025, Zachary Reichle wrote to solicit Plaintiffs\u2019 deposition availability in November or December. He noted a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and stated that the parties had agreed to Larry Church as mediator at the Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025. He added that he anticipated late February or March for mediation due to booked schedules in January and early February, and he suggested this timeline should not pose an issue for the Court since trial was not set until December 2026.\n\nIn a reply dated October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon informed Zach that his clients were available for depositions on any date during November 3\u20137, 2025, and asked that, if any of those dates would work, they could be scheduled accordingly.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Zach Reichle responded that November 6 and 7 would work for their office. He proposed scheduling all three depositions consecutively, from 9:00 a.m. to noon on November 7, 2025, but he also stated there would be no issue with holding the depositions on separate days if necessary.\n\nLater, on October 29, 2025 at 1:43 p.m., Bryce Koon replied that he had confirmed with Ms. Moore and Ms. Williams that they were available on November 7. He noted that Ms. Moore works that afternoon, so he preferred starting with her deposition first. He added that Mr. Ward had advised he would inform them by tomorrow whether he would be available on November 7, and he promised to relay any updates as soon as he received them.\n\nShortly thereafter, on October 29, 2025 at approximately 1:49 p.m., Zach Reichle replied that they would issue notices for Ms. Moore\u2019s deposition beginning at 9:00 a.m. on November 7, with Ms. Williams\u2019s deposition to follow at 11:00 a.m. He also stated that Mr. Ward was available the week of November 10 if November 7 did not work for him.\n\nThere is a further entry dated October 29, 2025 at 01:53:29 GMT-04:00, showing Bryce\u2019s prior message as: \u201cCounsel, Thank you for that. I will let you know for sure in the next day or so.\u201d This appears to correspond to the ongoing scheduling discussions and reflects the exchange of confirmations and pending confirmations.\n\nThe thread then includes earlier fragments from October 22 and October 24 messages recapped above, confirming the scheduling trajectory: the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions were being planned for the early November window, with specific time slots arranged for November 7 (Moore at 9:00 a.m., Williams at 11:00 a.m.) and Ward\u2019s potential availability in the week of November 10 if necessary.\n\nIn summary, the parties and their counsel were coordinating depositions for the Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson case, targeting November 7, 2025, with Ms. Moore and Ms. Williams confirmed for deposition at 9:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. respectively, and with Mr. Ward\u2019s availability to be confirmed or shifted to the following week if needed. They also discussed scheduling all three depositions on November 7 or on adjacent days and aligning mediation planning with a January 31, 2026 deadline and the previously agreed mediator, Larry Church. This record ends with the latest communications confirming the November 7 deposition times and ongoing coordination, reflecting a continuous effort to finalize deposition scheduling amid other docket constraints.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Julmonzhae-Moore-MVA-8-29-2023. Client: Julmonzhae Moore. In the matter of Williams, Ward, Moore v. Robinson (Floyd 22D03-2501-CT-000157), the record reflects ongoing deposition scheduling and discovery communications among counsel for the plaintiffs\u2014Williams, Ward, and Moore\u2014and defense counsel, with The Whaley Law Firm and Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC identified in the exchanges. The plaintiffs\u2019 MVA occurred on August 29, 2023, and Julmonzhae Moore is listed as a client in the case. The emails involve plaintiffs\u2019 depositions and related scheduling, as well as a mediation timeline that extends into early 2026. Recipients include Bryce Koon of The Whaley Law Firm; Zachary Reichle and Janet Weile of Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC; and cc\u2019d individuals associated with the three MVA clients via Filevine project email addresses: Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023, and Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023. The messages consistently note standard confidentiality and privilege notices.\n\nThe first dated thread in the record begins with communications around May 2025. A May 5, 2025 message from Bryce Koon to Dennis Cantrell and Zachary Reichle (with the three MVA clients\u2019 Filevine addresses and Janet Weile CC\u2019d) concerns scheduling depositions and related discovery matters, though the portion of the message visible in the record is truncated. A follow-up on May 7 indicates Bryce responded that July 7 would be fine. On May 19, 2025, Zach Reichle proposed a further extension of thirty days to finalize Defendant\u2019s responses to Plaintiffs\u2019 discovery requests, moving the due date from June 4 to July 7 (noting that June 4 plus thirty days lands on July 4 and the following two days are a weekend). Bryce replied later on May 19 that July 7 would be fine and offered to assist with anything else needed.\n\nMoving forward to late 2025, the parties' discussions turned to scheduling Plaintiffs\u2019 depositions. On October 17, 2025, Zach Reichle wrote that the plaintiffs\u2019 depositions should be scheduled and asked Bryce to provide availability in November or December. He also noted a mediation deadline of January 31, 2026 and stated that the parties had agreed, at a Case Management Conference held on July 29, 2025, to have Larry Church serve as mediator. He observed that January and early February were fully booked for his office, so mediation would likely occur in late February or March 2026, and he did not expect this to create issues with the Court given that trial was not set until December 2026. The message included Reichle\u2019s contact details (Direct: 317.224.2473) and a standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn October 22, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that his clients were available for depositions on any date from November 3 through November 7. He asked to be advised which dates would work so scheduling could proceed, reiterating availability for the three plaintiffs.\n\nOn October 24, 2025, Zach Reichle responded that November 6th and 7th work for their office and asked whether all three depositions could be scheduled consecutively. He proposed a schedule of 9:00 a.m. to noon on November 7th for the depositions but stated that they were open to holding the depositions on separate days if necessary. The message also noted the option to proceed with all three depositions during the dates proposed and mentioned the possibility of arranging a stacked schedule if feasible.\n\nOn October 29, 2025, Bryce Koon replied that Ms. Moore and Ms. Williams were available on the 7th, and that Mr. Ward would inform by tomorrow whether he would be available on November 7th. He indicated he would notify the other side as soon as he received Ward\u2019s confirmation.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the parties repeatedly referenced the case caption and the litigation timeline, including the pursuit of depositions for the three plaintiffs (Williams, Ward, and Moore) and the planned mediation with Larry Church, consistent with the July 29, 2025 Case Management Conference agreement. The notes also reflect that the email communications include confidentiality and privilege notices and identify the sending law firms and the relevant Filevine project email addresses for the participants.\n\nContact information appears in the record for the primary counsel: W. Bryce Koon, Esq., The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: 502-365-5043; Fax: 502-237-3207. Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, is listed with direct line 317-224-2473. The records also show copies sent to Dennis Cantrell, Ashlee Williams MVA, Dewayne Ward MVA, Julmonzhae Moore MVA, and Janet Weile, with the three MVA clients\u2019 Filevine project email addresses noted in the CC field.\n\nIn summary, the notes document a coordinated effort in spring 2025 and fall 2025 to schedule depositions for the three plaintiffs in the Williams-Ward-Moore v. Robinson case, with November 3\u20137, 2025 emerging as a primary window and a specific emphasis on November 7 for the round of depositions, alongside the ongoing plan for mediation to occur in early 2026, and a trial not anticipated until December 2026.",

This note concerns the Moore/Williams Depositions.\n\nIn the correspondence dated November 13, 2025 at 5:27:05 PM (Eastern Time, GMT-05:00), W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent a message to Zachary Reichle, Associate at Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, with copies to several Filevine project email addresses (Ashlee Williams MVA 8/29/23, Julmonzhae Moore MVA 8/29/2023, and Dewayne Ward MVA 8/29/2023). The email stated: \u201cGood evening counsel, Please provide me with dates for your client's deposition and we will get Dewayne's done the same day.\u201d It was signed with Bryce Koon\u2019s name and title, followed by The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; Phone: (502) 365-5043; Fax: (502) 237-3207. The message included a standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer advising that the electronic communication is intended only for the named recipient and that any inadvertent receipt should be reported to the firm, with directions not to use or forward the information to unauthorized persons.\n\nEarlier, on November 6, 2025, there was an exchange between Zachary Reichle and Bryce Koon regarding the deposition logistics. At 12:10 PM, Reichle forwarded an update to Bryce Koon and Dennis Cantrell, stating that the reporter had confirmed the depositions would proceed as scheduled and that they were awaiting a calendar invite with the Zoom link, which they would forward when available. Reichle also provided a Zoom meeting link for the deposition along with dial-in information: Join Zoom Meeting at https://stewartrichardson.zoom.us/j/81627086306?pwd=beXeD9HWwYbPQ9aVXcVoZd4CnKxuFN.1, Dial-in number 1 312 626 6799, Meeting ID 816 2708 6306, Passcode 462204. Reichle signed as Associate, with the direct line 317.224.2473, and listed the firm\u2019s address as Stoll Keenon Ogden PLLC, 334 N Senate Ave, Indianapolis, IN 46204. The message included a confidentiality notice typical of the firm\u2019s communications.\n\nEarlier still, on November 6, 2025 at 11:54 AM, Bryce Koon replied to Reichle and Dennis Cantrell, asking: \u201cGood morning counsel, Do you happen to have the Zoom link for tomorrow's depos? Just want to make sure I have everything ready to go with my clients.\u201d He provided his contact details and The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s address and phone and fax numbers, followed by an image placeholder note and the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nTogether, these messages comprise the deposition coordination for Moore and Williams, with the latest instruction on November 13, 2025 to provide deposition dates for the Moore client and schedule Dewayne Ward\u2019s deposition on the same day, and with Zoom logistics shared in the November 6, 2025 exchanges.",
