The policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company. The communications involved Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm and Sarah Mackay, a Casualty Claims Resolution Specialist II at Liberty Mutual. The email traffic includes standard policy and confidentiality language, along with the typical Liberty Mutual contact details and mailing addresses.\n\nOn January 14, 2025, Jessa Galosmo sent an external email to Sarah Mackay, attaching a letter of representation for Fina Fatty in response to the claim referenced as 058373025. The note shows Jessa\u2019s signature block with Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information. The message\u2019s subject line indicated it was an external communication regarding claim 058373025-06.\n\nOn January 23, 2025, Sarah Mackay replied as the assigned bodily injury adjuster. She stated that she had mailed an acknowledgement letter to Jessa\u2019s office and that the claim had liability accepted by Liberty Mutual. She noted that Liberty Mutual did not have permission from their insured to disclose the policy limits and requested an update on Fina\u2019s injury and treatment, as well as whether Fina is eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. This message also contained Liberty Mutual\u2019s standard confidentiality notice and contact details.\n\nOn January 24, 2025, Jessa Galosmo responded to Sarah, thanking her for the update and stating that Fina was still undergoing treatment for her injuries. Jessa also noted that Fina was not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. This email likewise carried the typical confidentiality language and Jessa\u2019s contact information.\n\nOn March 17, 2025, there was additional correspondence. At 4:04 PM, Sarah Mackay attempted to reach Jessa by phone to obtain an update on Fina\u2019s injury and treatment. Later that same day, at 4:16:46 PM, Jessa replied: \u201cMy apologies for the delayed response. Fina is already done with her treatment.\u201d\n\nThroughout the email thread, the communications include standard policy warnings, such as the confidentiality notice stating that the message and attachments are intended only for the named addressees and may contain privileged information; instructions to notify the sender and delete the message if received in error; and the various Liberty Mutual mailing addresses and contact numbers (Direct Phone: 469-997-3807; Fax: 603-334-8181; business hours; USPS and FedEx/UPS mailing options) and the disclaimer about not disclosing insured limits without authorization.

In that message, Aaron acknowledged the Ohio accident and stated that the current medical bills totaled $7,135, noting he did not know whether any set-offs or discounts had been applied by the provider. He proposed a counteroffer of $12,000, stating that this amount would be inclusive of the total medical bills and pain and suffering, and asked whether they could get this resolved.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, Sarah Mackay replied to Aaron (and to the Filevine recipient). She thanked him for the email and for the counter demand of $12,000, noting that she had also left a voicemail and was following up by email. She stated that Liberty Mutual is unable to meet that amount but could extend an offer of $3,195 to resolve the matter. She asked Aaron to review the offer with his client and to advise Liberty Mutual of the client\u2019s position.\n\nLater on July 21, 2025, at 2:53:47 PM (GMT-04:00), Aaron Whaley sent a follow-up reply thanking Liberty Mutual for the counter and requesting an explanation of the reasoning behind offering less than the medical bills.\n\nNotes accompanying the messages indicate the case metadata: Claim-Number 058373025, Exposure-Number 06, and that the correspondence was categorized as a Manual Outbound E-Mail with a template ID of BIFREEFORM. Liberty Mutual\u2019s policy is underwritten by Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company.

      "natural_language": "Case: Fina-Fatty-MVA-11-05-2024. Client: Fina Fatty. The matter concerns Claim #058373025 (Exposure #06) under Liberty Mutual Personal Insurance Company, with the case being handled by Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm for the client, Fina Fatty. The communications were exchanged with Sarah Mackay, Casualty Claims Resolution Specialist II at Liberty Mutual, and included the Filevine project address for the client.\n\nThe negotiation began in mid-July 2025. On July 14, 2025, Aaron Whaley sent an external email to Sarah Mackay and the Fina Fatty Filevine address regarding Claim #058373025. He reminded that the accident was in Ohio and stated that the current medical bills totaled $7,135.00, though he did not know whether providers had applied any set-offs or discounts. He proposed a counteroffer of $12,000, describing it as inclusive of the total medical bills and pain and suffering, and asked whether the amount could be approved. He signed as the attorney for Whaley Law Firm, listing his Louisville, Kentucky contact information.\n\nOn July 21, 2025, at 1:54 PM, Whaley followed up with Mackay and the Filevine address, asking for an explanation of Liberty Mutual\u2019s reasoning for offering less than the medical bills. Mackay replied later that day, at 2:34 PM, stating that Liberty Mutual could not meet the $12,000 figure. She advised an offer of $3,195 to resolve the matter and asked Whaley to review the offer with his client and convey their position.\n\nAnother exchange occurred later on July 25, 2025. At 8:16 PM, Mackay wrote that medical bills were inflated and that Liberty Mutual had reviewed them to determining what is usual and customary. She asked Aaron to review and respond. A short follow-up from Aaron occurred later that day: he sent a brief message, \u201cCare to share that review?\u201d and reaffirmed his firm\u2019s contact details.\n\nThroughout these communications, the Liberty Mutual communications included standard policy and contact information for Liberty Mutual or Safeco Claims, including mailing addresses for claim submissions and a confidentiality notice typical of such emails. The email thread reflects ongoing settlement discussions regarding Claim #058373025, with initial demand of $12,000 from the petitioner\u2019s side, a counteroffer of $3,195 from Liberty Mutual, and subsequent scrutiny of the medical bills\u2019 reasonableness by Liberty Mutual.",
