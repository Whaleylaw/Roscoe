      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. The client is the Estate of Evangeline Young. The matter concerns the Evangeline Young Police Report.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, two sequential emails were exchanged between Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm and Louisville/Jefferson County\u2019s Risk Management Division regarding the police report for the motor vehicle accident involving Evangeline Young. Earlier that morning, at 9:45 AM, Jessa Galosmo sent an email to RiskMgmtDivision with the subject Evangeline Young Police Report. The message, cautioning that it originated from outside Louisville Metro, stated that the police report on the accident of their client, Evangeline Young, was attached. The email was signed by Jessa Galosmo of the Whaley Law Firm, including her contact information: Ph: (502) 357-9975 and Fax: (502) 364-9363, and a confidentiality notice restricting disclosure and requiring deletion if received in error.\n\nLater that day, at 10:00:33 AM -0400, Jessa again emailed RiskMgmtDivision with the same subject and asked: \u201cMay I also know the fax number or email where I can send our letter of representation?\u201d\n\nRisk Management Division replied, indicating that there is already a claim set up for this incident and it is being handled by their adjuster. They provided the claim number: 305240079, and the contact information for Risk Management Services Co.: 502-326-5900. They stated they would also send the adjuster an email with Whaley\u2019s contact information. The response was signed by Louisville Metro Government Risk Management Division, located at 611 W. Jefferson St., Louisville, Kentucky 40202, with Office: 502-574-3404 and Fax: 502-574-3932, and the general inbox Riskmgmtdivision@louisvilleky.gov. The signature included the standard confidentiality notice about privileged information and instructions if the message was received in error, and there was an image of the lou_metro_logo50px.\n\nThe initial 9:45 AM message from Jessa included a separate formal closing: \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo, Whaley Law Firm,\u201d followed by her direct line and fax (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363). The email also carried the standard confidentiality disclaimer, noting that the information was confidential and intended solely for the recipient, and prohibiting disclosure or action by anyone not authorized to receive it.\n\nIn sum, the communications establish the Estate of Evangeline Young as the client, confirm that a police report for the Evangeline Young Police Report was attached in the initial submission, indicate that a representation letter is being prepared and needed (hence the question about where to send it), confirm that a claim already exists (Claim #305240079) and is under the care of the risk management adjuster, and provide the relevant contact details for Risk Management Services Co. and Louisville Metro Risk Management Division, along with the associated confidentiality notices and standard firm contact information for Whaley Law Firm.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. Client: Estate of Evangeline Young. The matter concerns a motor vehicle accident involving Evangeline Young and is being managed under Louisville Metro\u2019s claim system as Metro claim number 305240079.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, at approximately 11:33 AM, Clarke McCulloch, Property & Casualty Claims Manager, sent a message stating that he trusted Whaley Law Firm would forward their attached demand with supports to Ms. Young\u2019s insurance carrier and/or estate manager. The message was addressed to Jessa Galosmo and was part of a forward chain showing the firm\u2019s ongoing handling of the claim, with Jessa\u2019s forward dated October 11, 2023 at 11:36:24 AM to Aaron Whaley and Bryce Koon, with Justin Chumbley CC\u2019d.\n\nThe prior communications, beginning on September 27, 2023, reflect the core contact with Louisville Metro Government\u2019s Risk Management Division about Evangeline Young\u2019s police report. At 9:45 AM that day, Jessa sent RiskMgmtDivision an email entitled \u201cEvangeline Young Police Report,\u201d stating, \u201cHi, Attached is the police report on the accident of our client, Evangeline Young,\u201d and signing off with \u201cAll the best, Jessa Galosmo\u201d from the Whaley Law Firm; the message included confidential information disclosures and repeated the firm\u2019s contact details (Ph: 502-357-9975; Fax: 502-364-9363). The email was followed by multiple confirmations and cautions about external emails and confidentiality.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 9:55 AM, RiskMgmtDivision replied that a claim had already been set up for this incident and was being handled by their adjuster, providing the claim number 305240079 and listing Risk Management Services Co. with the contact number 502-326-5900; the division also stated they would send the firm\u2019s contact information to the adjuster, and provided the Louisville Metro Risk Management Division\u2019s mailing address (611 W. Jefferson St., Louisville, KY 40202), office phone (502-574-3404), fax (502-574-3932), and email (Riskmgmtdivision@louisvilleky.gov), along with a confidentiality notice.\n\nAt 10:01 AM on September 27, 2023, Jessa sent another email to RiskMgmtDivision, with EvangelineYoungMVAZ3900418@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com CC\u2019d, asking, \u201cMay I also know the fax number or email where I can send our letter of representation?\u201d The prior message had indicated there was already a claim and provided the claim number and contact information for Risk Management Services Co., with the expectation that an LOR would be forwarded to the adjuster.\n\nA few minutes later, at 10:54 AM, RiskMgmtDivision replied that the LOR could be sent to the same email address and that they would forward it to the adjuster, again listing the same claim number (305240079) and the same Risk Management contact details. The reply included the standard confidentiality notice.\n\nFilling in the thread, at 11:10 AM on September 27, 2023, Jessa sent a follow-up that the message regarding Evangeline Young Police Report should include \u201cPlease see attached LOR,\u201d reflecting the continued exchange about the letter of representation and the police report. The CC line for this message included EvangelineYoungMVAZ3900418@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, reinforcing the involvement of the estate\u2019s representation.\n\nIn summary, the estate\u2019s MVA matter has run through a series of communications beginning with the police report attachment on September 27, 2023, the solicitation and forwarding of a letter of representation, and subsequent coordination between Whaley Law Firm and Louisville Metro Risk Management, culminating in Clarke McCulloch\u2019s October 11, 2023 directive to forward the attached demand with supports to the estate\u2019s insurer or estate manager, with the Metro claim number 305240079 consistently referenced throughout. The chain includes the attached LOR and police report, the contact details for Risk Management Division and Risk Management Services Co., and multiple confidentiality and outside-email cautions that accompanied the emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. Client: Estate of Evangeline Young.\n\nIn October 2023, within the matter titled Estate of Evangeline Young arising from the motor vehicle accident on August 12, 2023, attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm initiated contact with Louisville Metro Police Department, corresponding with Scott Gowen. On October 11, 2023 at 12:36:10 PM (Eastern Time), Whaley advised Gowen that the family wished to retrieve items from Evangeline Young\u2019s vehicle. He noted that the estate had not yet been opened, and that at present it would be the husband who was requesting access, though he might decide not to serve as administrator; that decision had not yet been made.\n\nEarlier that same day, Gowen had written back with clarifying questions. He asked whether the family was seeking the release of the car itself or simply the retrieval of items from inside the vehicle, and whether there was a duly appointed personal representative of the Estate who was requesting the vehicle and its contents. Gowen stated his goal was to ensure that Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) released the vehicle to the correct person, assuming the investigation would be completed.\n\nPrior to Gowen\u2019s reply, Whaley had sent an initial message at 12:09 PM on October 11, 2023, in which he asked who he needed to speak with to gain access to Mrs. Young\u2019s vehicle and belongings, noting that the family would like to have them. In that email, Whaley included his signature with contact information and a confidentiality notice indicating that the message was confidential and intended only for the recipient and others authorized to receive it; it also warned that disclosure, copying, distribution, or action regarding the contents could be unlawful if the recipient was not authorized. The message also contained the standard external-mail caution about the email originating from outside Louisville Metro. Whaley\u2019s contact details were listed as Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023\nClient: Estate of Evangeline Young\n\nIn the Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023 matter, counsel for the Estate of Evangeline Young pursued access to items from Evangeline Young\u2019s vehicle in the wake of a motor vehicle accident. The communications span mid-October 2023 and center on obtaining proof of ownership and permission to retrieve or access belongings from the vehicle, which was reportedly on hold.\n\nOn October 16, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Scott Gowen. In that outside-Louisville Metro email (noting a caution that the message originated outside Louisville Metro and advising caution with links and attachments), Bryce acknowledged a prior discussion between Gowen and Aaron about Ms. Young\u2019s family wanting to retrieve items from the vehicle and stated his intent to follow up on the request, offering to retrieve the requested items himself if necessary. The message concluded with Bryce\u2019s standard attorney-client confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nThe following day, October 17, 2023, Gowen responded to Bryce, informing him that Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) would not permit access to the vehicle without some proof of ownership. Gowen asked Bryce to obtain such proof.\n\nOn October 18, 2023, Bryce replied to Gowen with a short message reading \u201cRE: Evangeline Young,\u201d stating \u201cGood morning Scott, Please see below.\u201d This reply also carried a standard confidentiality disclaimer indicating the message's privileged nature and advising the recipient to contact The Whaley Law Firm if the message was received in error.\n\nFinally, on October 23, 2023, Bryce sent a follow-up to Gowen. In that email, Bryce said, \u201cGood afternoon Scott, I just wanted to follow up on this. From my review online, it appears the vehicle is still on hold. Any update would be greatly appreciated.\u201d This message, like the others, included The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the key facts preserved include: the case name and date, the client (Estate of Evangeline Young), the estate\u2019s objective to retrieve items from the vehicle, the need for ownership proof before vehicle access could be granted by LMPD, Bryce\u2019s willingness to retrieve items if needed, and the vehicle\u2019s ongoing hold status as of October 23, 2023. Each email also contained a standard confidentiality and privilege disclaimer, with the October 16 message additionally carrying a caution about outside email. The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details (Bryce Koon, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) appeared in the signatures.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative covers the TeamCare subrogation matter for the Estate of Evangeline Young related to the August 12, 2023 motor vehicle accident. The client is the Estate of Evangeline Young, and our file number for this matter is 23-23403. The case involves Evangeline L. Howard and the TeamCare subrogation process under the Central States Health Fund framework.\n\nOn November 1, 2023, Jessa Galosmo of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Taneesha Jackson (Leg) at Central States to provide the contact information for the claim adjuster at Risk Management Services Company (RMSC). The adjuster is J. Clarke Mcculloch, who can be reached at 502-708-3100 or cmcculloch@rmsc.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, Taneesha Jackson replied requesting the phone number for the at-fault party, referred to as Risk Management. Jessa\u2019s email to Taneesha included the adjuster contact details noted above, and the message was part of the ongoing subrogation communications between TeamCare and Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThis exchange followed a prior thread from October 25, 2023. In Jessa\u2019s 3:45 PM message, she wrote a high-alert notice regarding external email safety and provided the information previously requested: the PIP claim with USAA Insurance Company, claim number 037621490-800, and the BI claim with Risk Management Services Company, claim number 305240079. She also attached a copy of the police report.\n\nEarlier on October 25, 2023, at 4:39 PM, Taneesha Jackson had requested from Jessa the following information: Ms. Howard\u2019s auto insurance information (company name and claim/policy number), the at-fault party\u2019s auto insurance information (company name and claim/policy number), and a copy of the police report.\n\nThe communication chain also included standard TeamCare signatures and contact details for Taneesha Jackson, including TeamCare \u2013 A Central States Health Fund, 8647 W. Higgins Rd, Chicago, IL 60631; Office phone 847.720.3629; Fax 847.518.9718; and tjackson@centralstatesfunds.org. The emails carried attorney-privileged and confidential notices, with instructions to recipients if they were not the intended recipients, and several formal disclaimers reiterating that benefits interpretations are subject to plan documents and are not final determinations.\n\nIn summary, the key facts documented are the estate\u2019s MVA case, the file number 23-23403, the involvement of Evangeline L. Howard, the TeamCare subrogation context, the PIP and BI claim numbers (USAA 037621490-800 and RMSC 305240079, respectively), the attached police report, and the contact details of the RMSC adjuster, J. Clarke Mcculloch, as well as the at-fault party information being pursued through Risk Management.",

Whaley stated that the dash cam would obviously shed a lot of light on the matter and could hasten resolution, and he requested that Gowen share the footage or provide any available timeframe for when it might be released.\n\nTo set the context, in a prior chain dated October 11, 2023, Whaley had written at 12:36 PM that the family wished to retrieve items from the vehicle and noted that the estate had not yet been opened. He indicated that, at that time, the request would be made by the husband, although the husband might decide not to serve as administrator, a decision that had not yet been made.\n\nEarlier on October 11, 2023, at 12:19 PM, Gowen responded with clarifying questions: whether the family was seeking the car to be released to them or merely items from within the vehicle; and whether there was a duly appointed personal representative of the Estate requesting the vehicle and its contents. Gowen emphasized the need to ensure that Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) releases the vehicle to the correct person, assuming the investigation is complete.\n\nBefore that, at 12:09 PM on October 11, 2023, Aaron Whaley had written to Gowen (with EvangelineYoungMVAZ3900418_CC\u2019d) stating that he was trying to determine who he needed to speak to in order to gain access to Mrs. Young\u2019s vehicle and Mrs. Young\u2019s belongings, as her family would like to have them. The message included Whaley\u2019s firm details:\n\nWhaley Law Firm\n712 Lyndon Lane\nLouisville, KY 40222\n502-583-4022\n\nThe email also contained the standard confidentiality disclaimer indicating that the information was intended for the recipient and may be confidential, and cautioned that the email originated from outside Louisville Metro, advising not to click links or disclose information unless the sender\u2019s address and content were known to be safe. The same contact details for Aaron Whaley appeared in the closing signature.",

The following series of emails between attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and Louisville Metro Police Department liaison Scott Gowen trace the requests to access the vehicle and its contents and to obtain any dash or body camera footage from Officer Ray.\n\nOn October 11, 2023, Aaron Whaley asked Scott Gowen who he needed to speak with to obtain access to Mrs. Young\u2019s vehicle and Mrs. Young\u2019s belongings, noting that the estate had not yet been opened and that the husband would be the requester for now, though he may decide not to serve as administrator, a decision that had not yet been made.\n\nLater that day, Gowen asked for clarification: was the family seeking release of the car or retrieval of items, and who would be the duly appointed personal representative to request the vehicle and its contents, ensuring that the vehicle is released to the right person once the investigation is complete?\n\nEarlier that same day, Aaron had written to Gowen seeking guidance on who to contact to gain access to the vehicle and belongings, reiterating the family\u2019s interest in obtaining them.\n\nIn another October 11, 2023 message, Aaron stated that the family wanted to retrieve items from the vehicle and that the estate had not yet been opened; for now, the husband would be the requester, but he might decide not to serve as administrator, a decision not yet made.\n\nOn November 2, 2023, Aaron wrote that they had made an open records request for Officer Ray\u2019s body camera and dash camera. He explained that the dash camera would shed a lot of light on the case and could hasten resolution, and asked Gowen to share the footage or provide a timeframe if it could not be shared.\n\nOn November 6, 2023, at about 8:26 a.m., Gowen responded that Officer Ray\u2019s body camera was not activated at the time of the accident because he was not on an emergency run, and there was no body camera that captured the accident. Based on Gowen\u2019s investigation, he stated that Evangeline Young\u2019s client was northbound on Smyrna Parkway and crossed into the southbound lane, striking Officer Ray, and he added that your client\u2019s blood alcohol level was .22.\n\nLater that same day, at approximately 11:36 a.m., Whaley replied: he assumed there was no dash cam either, in addition to no body camera. He then requested the officer\u2019s vehicle \u201cblack box\u201d data and asked Gowen to share it if it had already been retrieved; if not, he asked to schedule a time to obtain it, and he emphasized that the vehicle should not be disposed of.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate of Evangeline Young arising from an August 12, 2023 motor vehicle accident, Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al., Jefferson County Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-003826. The estate is represented by The Whaley Law Firm. The note documents a chain of correspondence regarding discovery in the matter, with the primary sender identified as W. Bryce Koon, Esq., and the recipient as Katie Watts, Esq., both involved in the case, and with several individuals copied on the messages (including Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 Filevine project email address, Scott Gowen of Louisville, KY, and Sarena Tuttle of Whaley Law Firm). The subject line of the primary thread is \u201cEstate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-003826).\u201d\n\nOn July 10, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Katie Watts with the subject noted above, attaching Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming and the associated notice filed that day. He indicated that if there were any questions, Katie should let him know. The email included Bryce\u2019s standard signature for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the firm\u2019s phone number (502) 365-5043 and fax (502) 237-3207, and carried the customary attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer stating that the message is intended only for the named recipient and that any error should be reported to The Whaley Law Firm. The CC line included Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 Filevine Project Email Address and Scott Gowen (scott.gowen@louisvilleky.gov).\n\nEarlier that day, or in the same thread, no further content from Katie Watts is shown, but the chain continues with subsequent messages in September.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, at 9:55 AM, Katie Watts replied to Bryce, requesting that he advise when they could expect his client\u2019s overdue responses to written discovery. She signed as Partner, with direct line (502) 560-9949, and included the customary confidentiality notice.\n\nShortly thereafter, at 10:20 AM on September 3, 2024, Bryce responded: he anticipated having those responses by the end of the week and again asked Katie to advise when they might expect her client\u2019s responses. He reiterated the request for the other side\u2019s responses and closed with his standard firm signature and confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, at 8:34 AM, Katie Watts wrote again in the same thread: she did not believe they had ever received the discovery responses referenced previously and asked Bryce to advise. Her message again included the attorney\u2019s signature block and the standard confidentiality disclaimer.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:09 AM, Bryce replied to Katie. He explained that he had nearly everything ready but was still awaiting a couple of items from Mr. Young\u2014verification and authorizations, among others. He stated that he had sent everything but had not yet received the signatures, and he committed to following up that day and expected to have the materials shortly. He then requested, in the meantime, that Katie advise when they might expect the opposing side\u2019s responses as well. His message concluded with his signature, the firm\u2019s contact information, and the confidentiality notice.\n\nOverall, the record reflects an ongoing exchange regarding the production of discovery responses in Estate of Evangeline Young, with multiple confirmations that the plaintiff\u2019s discovery was prepared or nearly ready, and ongoing requests for the defendants\u2019 overdue responses, while the estate sought to obtain signatures and verifications from Mr. Young to finalize the materials.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. The client is the Estate of Evangeline Young. This matter is Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al., Jefferson County, case number 24-CI-003826.\n\nBetween July and October 2024, counsel exchanged a series of discovery-related emails regarding the Derby City Gaming matter in the Jefferson County case. On July 10, 2024 at 5:16 PM, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent Katie Watts, Esq., of PPOA Law, with cc to Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 - Filevine Project Email Address (EvangelineYoungMVAZ3900418@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and to Scott Gowen, regarding Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. The subject was the Jefferson County case 24-CI-003826. In the body, Koon advised that attached to the email was Plaintiff's First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming, along with the associated notice filed that day, and he invited any questions. He signed the message with his Whaley Law Firm contact information and included the standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer stating the message is intended only for the named recipient and should not be shared or used if received in error.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, at 9:55 AM, Katie Watts replied to Bryce Koon, stating: \u201cMr. Koon, Please advise as to when we can expect to receive your client\u2019s overdue responses to written discovery. Thanks.\u201d Watts\u2019s message carried her signature block showing she is a Partner and providing Direct: (502) 560-9949, and again included the filevine project email address in the cc list, along with the same attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer present in the earlier email.\n\nLater that same day, at 10:20 AM, Bryce Koon responded: \u201cGood morning Ms. Watts, I should have those responses to you by the end of the week. Can you advise when we may expect your client's responses?\u201d His reply, which again included the filevine address in the CC line and carried The Whaley Law Firm signature block with the same contact information and the standard confidentiality disclaimer, reiterated, in effect, his expectation to provide the client\u2019s responses by week\u2019s end and requested guidance on when the opposing side might provide their responses as well.\n\nThese September exchanges followed an earlier July 10, 2024 email from Bryce Koon. In that July email, sent at 5:16 PM to Katie Watts and John Parker and cc\u2019ing Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address and Scott Gowen, Koon stated, \u201cGood afternoon counsel, Attached hereto you will find Plaintiff's First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming, along with the associated notice filed today. If you have any questions in this regard, please let me know.\u201d The email again bore The Whaley Law Firm signature block and its confidentiality disclaimer, and included the same filevine address as part of the cc list.\n\nFinally, on October 14, 2024, at approximately 8:34 AM, Katie Watts wrote: \u201cBryce, I do not believe we ever received the discovery responses indicated below. Please advise.\u201d This message also carried Watts\u2019s professional signature and the standard privilege disclaimer.\n\nShortly thereafter, on October 14, 2024, at 10:09:27 AM, Bryce Koon replied: \u201cGood morning Katie, I have everything just about ready to go, but I am still waiting on a couple of things from Mr. Young (verification, authorizations, etc.). I have sent everything over, but am yet to receive signatures. I will follow up again today, and should have them over to you very shortly. In the meantime, could you please advise when we may expect your client's responses as well?\u201d This final reply again included the Whaley Law Firm contact information and the standard attorney\u2011client privilege disclaimer.\n\nIn sum, the record reflects a continuing negotiation over Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery and corresponding responses in the Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. The Whaley Law Firm reported near-term delivery of Mr. Young\u2019s verifications and signatures, while requesting reciprocal timing from opposing counsel for their client\u2019s discovery responses. Each email carried the applicable confidentiality disclaimer and the relevant contact details for the sending firm, and several messages referenced the Filevine project email address associated with Evangeline Young MVA.",

      "natural_language": "In the matter of Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-003826), the plaintiff is the Estate of Evangeline Young, arising from a motor vehicle accident on August 12, 2023. The note here compiles a sequence of email communications among the parties\u2019 counsel regarding discovery, signatures, and scheduling, with cc\u2019d recipients including the Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 Filevine project address, Scott Gowen of Louisville/KY, and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email to Katie Watts and others advising that, attached to the message, Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming had been filed that day, along with the associated notice. He stated that if there were any questions, they should be directed to him, and he provided his firm\u2019s contact information.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, at 9:55 a.m., Katie Watts asked Mr. Koon to advise when they could expect the defendant\u2019s overdue responses to written discovery. The thread continued with Bryce Koon replying at 10:20 a.m.: \u201cGood morning Ms. Watts, I should have those responses to you by the end of the week. Can you advise when we may expect your client\u2019s responses?\u201d He noted that he had \u201ceverything just about ready to go,\u201d but was still waiting on a few items from Mr. Young (verification, authorizations, etc.), and that he had sent everything but had not yet received signatures. He added that he would follow up again that day and should have them over to her very shortly. The message concluded with the standard attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier in the thread, there were repeated expectations and inquiries about discovery, with Bryce\u2019s message indicating that certain items required Mr. Young\u2019s signatures and authorizations, and that Katie\u2019s team\u2019s responses were being awaited.\n\nOn the same date, October 3, 2024, Katie Watts sent a separate message to Bryce indicating, \u201cBryce, I do not believe we ever received the discovery responses indicated below. Please advise.\u201d This was part of the ongoing exchange regarding discovery responses and the status of production.\n\nLater, on October 14, 2024, Bryce replied to Katie\u2019s ongoing inquiry from the morning: \u201cGood morning Katie, I have everything just about ready to go, but I am still waiting on a couple of things from Mr. Young (verification, authorizations, etc.). I have sent everything over, but am yet to receive signatures. I will follow up again today, and should have them over to you very shortly. In the meantime, could you please advise when we may expect your client\u2019s responses as well?\u201d He noted that he had sent all applicable materials but was awaiting signatures and further verifications.\n\nThat afternoon, at 2:15 p.m. (plus time zone stated as +0000), Katie Watts responded: \u201cI\u2019ll have them to you a couple weeks after I receive yours. I\u2019d also like to schedule Dwight Young\u2019s deposition. Please provide some dates in November/December. Thank you.\u201d Watts identified herself as a partner and provided her direct line: (502) 560-9949.\n\nEarlier in the day, Katie had also posted, \u201cBryce, I do not believe we ever received the discovery responses indicated below. Please advise,\u201d reiterating the need for the other side\u2019s discovery responses.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, standard attorney-client privileged disclosures and instructions were included in each message. The communications were addressed to and cc\u2019d multiple times among the firms involved, including The Whaley Law Firm and the plaintiff\u2019s filevine project address, as well as Scott Gowen and Sarena Tuttle, with the subject line consistently referencing Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-003826).\n\nIn summary, the record reflects ongoing discovery efforts in the Estate of Evangeline Young matter, with Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Derby City Gaming filed on July 10, 2024, repeated inquiries about overdue responses from the defense, and concurrent steps to schedule Dwight Young\u2019s deposition, including requests for November/December dates. The parties\u2019 counsel repeatedly noted that certain items (verification, authorizations, and signatures) were outstanding from Mr. Young, and that the plaintiff anticipated receiving the defense\u2019s responses and the plaintiff\u2019s own responses in a staggered timeline.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al., Jefferson County Circuit Court case number 24-CI-003826, with the client listed as the Estate of Evangeline Young. The matter is an MVA (motor vehicle accident) action initiated by the estate, and the structured note documents a series of discovery communications between counsel for the estate, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, and opposing counsel, Katie Watts, Partner (at the time) with the recipient firm identified in the header. The emails also circulated to the Evangeline Young MVA Filevine project address, Scott Gowen of Louisville/County government, and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, among others. The communications span July 10, 2024, through November 18, 2024, and reference the defendant Derby City Gaming.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, Bryce Koon sent an email to Katie Watts attaching Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming, along with the accompanying notice filed on that date, and he invited any questions about the discovery materials.\n\nIn the sequence that followed, on September 3, 2024, Katie Watts asked when the overdue discovery responses might be provided by Mr. Koon\u2019s client, and Bryce Koon replied later that same morning (at 10:20 AM) that he should have those responses by the end of the week and asked Katie to advise when they could expect her client\u2019s responses as well. Earlier that morning, Watts had urged prompting a response to the overdue discovery.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, Watts reiterated the request for overdue responses, and Koon responded with the promise of forthcoming responses by week\u2019s end and inquired again about when they might receive the opposing party\u2019s responses.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, Katie Watts stated that she did not believe the discovery responses had ever been received as indicated in the prior communications and asked Bryce Koon to advise. In response, Bryce Koon replied later that morning (10:09 AM) that he had nearly everything prepared but was still waiting on a few things from Mr. Young\u2014verification and authorizations\u2014and that although he had sent everything, he had not yet received the signatures. He indicated he would follow up that day and should have the materials shortly, and he again requested Ms. Watts to advise when they might expect her client\u2019s responses.\n\nAlso on October 14, 2024, Watts replied (at 10:16 AM) that she would provide Derby City Gaming\u2019s responses a couple of weeks after receiving Mr. Koon\u2019s, and she requested dates in November or December to schedule Dwight Young\u2019s deposition.\n\nFinally, on November 18, 2024, Bryce Koon sent a closing inquiry: \u201cGood afternoon counsel, please advise when we may expect Derby City Gaming\u2019s response to the outstanding discovery requests in this regard.\u201d The message again carried the same formal attorney-disclaimer language about privilege and recipient limitations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. Client: Estate of Evangeline Young.\n\nIn the matter of Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson County Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-003826), counsel at The Whaley Law Firm engaged in a sequence of discovery communications during 2024. On July 10, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., wrote to Katie Watts, Esq., attaching Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming and the associated notice filed that day. He asked that if there were any questions, she let him know, and he signed the message as \u201cW. Bryce Koon, Esq.\u201d The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact details appeared in the signature: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207. The email also carried the customary attorney-client privilege disclaimer.\n\nEarlier, on September 3, 2024, Katie Watts asked Bryce when they could expect the defendants\u2019 overdue responses to written discovery. Bryce replied later that same day, stating that he should have the responses by the end of the week and asking Katie to advise when the estate could expect its own responses.\n\nAlso on September 3, 2024, Bryce reached out again asking when the defense\u2019s responses would be provided, reiterating his request for clarity on the timing of the other side\u2019s disclosures.\n\nOn October 14, 2024, Katie Watts responded that she did not believe they had ever received the discovery responses referenced in the prior communications and asked Bryce to advise. Bryce replied that he had almost everything prepared but was still waiting for a couple of items from Mr. Young, specifically verification and authorizations, and that he had sent everything but had not yet received signatures. He said he would follow up again that day and should have the materials shortly, and he asked Katie to indicate when the plaintiff\u2019s responses might be produced.\n\nLater on October 14, 2024, Katie Watts replied that she would deliver the defense\u2019s responses a couple of weeks after she received Bryce\u2019s materials and also requested scheduling Dwight Young\u2019s deposition, asking for dates in November or December.\n\nFinally, on November 18, 2024, at 4:01 PM Eastern Time, Bryce Koon again emailed Katie Watts, asking when Derby City Gaming could be expected to respond to the outstanding discovery requests in this matter. This message was cc\u2019d to Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 \u2013 Filevine Project Email Address, Scott Gowen, and Sarena Tuttle.\n\nAll communications reflect the ongoing discovery timeline in this case, with the parties each seeking timely responses and scheduling the deposition of Dwight Young, while repeatedly noting that certain signatures, verifications, and authorizations were outstanding. The correspondence displays the typical attorney-client disclaimer included with each Whaley Law Firm email and the continuing coordination among the involved counsel and recipients.",

The matter concerns the motor vehicle accident case involving Evangeline Young, with the case file referenced as TM 23-23403, and the matter sits under the administration of TeamCare \u2013 A Central States Health Fund.\n\nIn August 2024, communications between Megan L. Gutgsell, a Subrogation Paralegal in the Law Department of TeamCare, and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm establish the current status and points of contact for the file. On August 19, 2024 at 11:36 AM, Sarena informed Megan that Mrs. Evangeline Young (formerly Evangeline Howard) has a claim that is in litigation, and that there are no settlement negotiations expected for at least 90 days. She requested Megan to \u201cdiary out at least 90 days for a new status update\u201d and asked Megan to update the file to reflect Sarena and Bryce Koon as the new points of contact. Sarena signed as Litigation Paralegal & Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; her direct line was 502-357-9971, office line 502-583-4022 ext 104, and her email address was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note indicating a NEW EMAIL ADDRESS. The message included the external email warning banner typical for recipients outside the sender\u2019s organization.\n\nLater on August 19, 2024 at 4:04 PM, Megan responded with a request for the contact information for Mr. Bryce Koon so she could update the file and indicated she would set a 90-day calendar reminder.\n\nThe following day, August 20, 2024, at 8:56 AM, Sarena replied with Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information: W. Bryce Koon, Esq, The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Office phone: 502-583-4022, ext 114; Email: Bryce@WhaleyLawFirm.com.

She indicated that they did not expect any settlement negotiations for at least 90 days and requested that Megan \u201cdairy out\u201d at least 90 days for a new status update. Sarena also requested that Megan update her file to reflect Sarena herself and Mr. Bryce Koon as new points of contact for the file. The message included the Whaley Law Firm\u2019s contact information, including The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; telephone numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; and email addresses Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and Bryce@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.\u201d The message also included the standard attorney-privilege disclaimers and confidentiality notices.\n\nLater on August 19, 2024, Megan Gutgsell replied requesting Mr. Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information so she could update her file, and she stated she would set a calendar reminder for 90 days.\n\nThe next day, August 20, 2024, Sarena responded with a high-alert notice indicating the email was external. She provided Bryce Koon\u2019s contact information\u2014The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 114; E: Bryce@WhaleyLawFirm.com\u2014along with Sarena\u2019s contact details and email address (also noting the new email address). The message included the firm\u2019s standard contact block for Sarena M. Tuttle and again reminded that the new email address should be used.\n\nOn November 19, 2024, Megan Gutgsell sent another inquiry asking for an update on the status of the case. Her signature identified her as Megan L. Gutgsell, Subrogation Paralegal, Law Department, TeamCare \u2013 A Central States Health Fund, located at 8647 W. Higgins Road, Chicago, IL 60631, with office and fax numbers (Office) (847) 939-2441 and (Fax) (847) 518-9797, and the email mgutgsel@centralstatesfunds.org.\n\nIn the afternoon of November 19, 2024, Sarena Tuttle responded: \u201cGood afternoon Megan, Mrs. Young's claim is still in litigation. We anticipate this claim will go all the way to trial, however, you are welcome to dairy out 120 to check in again. If you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.\u201d The response was signed with Sarena\u2019s contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 357-9971; O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; and a reminder to note the new email address.\n\nThe transmission also contained the standard confidentiality and privilege reminders, including statements about attorney privilege and confidentiality, and a disclaimer reiterating that only the Board of Trustees is authorized to interpret the benefits plans offered under TeamCare and the Central States Health and Welfare Fund and Pension Fund, with the caveat that benefits representations are estimates or projections, not final determinations or guarantees of payment, and that benefits are paid in accordance with the applicable plan documents.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-003826). Client: Estate of Evangeline Young.\n\nThe matter centers on the Estate of Evangeline Young and its liabilities against Jacob Ray and others in Jefferson County Circuit Court, case number 24-CI-003826. The communications documented here trace discovery and deposition scheduling efforts between counsel for the Estate and the defendant Derby City Gaming, beginning in July 2024 and continuing through November 2024.\n\nOn July 10, 2024, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm, informed Katie Watts that Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery to Defendant Derby City Gaming had been attached, along with the associated notice filed that day. He stated that if there were any questions, she should let him know, and he provided his firm\u2019s contact details. This message circulated with the subject of the Estate of Evangeline Young v. Jacob Ray, et al. (Jefferson 24-CI-003826) and included copies to the relevant Filevine project address and colleagues, with standard attorney-client notice disclaimers.\n\nOn September 3, 2024, Katie Watts responded, asking to be advised when they could expect the defendant\u2019s responses to the written discovery. In a follow-up that day, Bryce Koon replied that he should have those responses by the end of the week and asked Katie to advise when their client\u2019s responses could be expected as well.\n\nLater that same day, Katie again pressed for clarification on the overdue responses, stating that she did not believe they had received the discovery responses indicated. Bryce had earlier indicated he would have the responses by week\u2019s end and reiterated his request for Katie\u2019s client\u2019s responses.\n\nMoving to October 2024, on October 14 at 8:34 a.m., Katie Watts wrote that she did not believe they had ever received the discovery responses referenced previously and asked Bryce to advise. At 10:09 a.m., Bryce replied that he had nearly everything ready but was waiting on a couple of items from Mr. Young (verification, authorizations, etc.), and that he had sent everything over but had not yet received signatures. He indicated he would follow up that day and should have them over shortly, and he requested that Katie advise when they could expect her client\u2019s responses.\n\nLater on October 14, at 10:16 a.m., Katie replied that she would send them \u201ca couple weeks after I receive yours\u201d and that she would also like to schedule Dwight Young\u2019s deposition, requesting dates in November and December.\n\nThroughout this period, notices and emails continued to circulate among counsel, with confidentiality notices typical of electronic communications indicating that the messages were intended only for the named recipients and advising that any inadvertent receipt should be reported to The Whaley Law Firm and that the information should not be used or shared.\n\nOn November 18, 2024, Bryce again asked for guidance on when Derby City Gaming\u2019s outstanding discovery responses could be expected, reiterating the request in the ongoing discovery process.\n\nFinally, on November 22, 2024, Katie Watts replied that the discovery materials were nearly complete and, due to the upcoming holiday, she expected to have them to Bryce two weeks from that date, if not sooner. She signed as a partner, providing direct contact information.\n\nNotes: The email chain includes the following participants and references: Katie Watts (recipient/counsel), Bryce Koon (counsel), the Estate of Evangeline Young MVA 8/12/2023 Filevine project address (CC\u2019d), Scott Gowen (CC\u2019d), and Sarena Tuttle (CC\u2019d). The communications reference Derby City Gaming as the defendant and discuss the Plaintiff\u2019s First Set of Discovery, outstanding discovery responses, verification and authorizations from Mr. Young, and the scheduling of Dwight Young\u2019s deposition. The correspondence includes standard attorney-client privileged notices and confidentiality language typical of the electronic messages exchanged.",

      "natural_language": "The case is Estate of Evangeline Young, relating to Young v Derby City Gaming LLC, et al., with the client listed as the Estate of Evangeline Young. The deposition scheduling discussion took place by email on March 6, 2025, among Katie Watts of PPOA Law, Sarena Tuttle and others from The Whaley Law Firm, and Scott Gowen of FMD Legal, regarding when Mr. Young (the likely deponent) could be available for a 1:30 p.m. start at least three weeks out. The emails also reference several potential dates, including April 22, 23, 24, or April 29, 20, or May 1.\n\nIn Katie Watts\u2019s March 6, 2025 email, she stated that she was available for depositions on April 8, 9, 15, 17, and 18, and she asked Mr. Gowen to confirm which of those dates would work for him. She included her direct line as (502) 560-9949 and identified herself as a Partner.\n\nScott Gowen replied the same day, noting that of the dates offered, he could only do April 18, and he reminded everyone to spell his name Gowen, not Gowan. His message also appeared to be sent from his iPad, and he corrected the spelling in a subsequent reply.\n\nSarena Tuttle, also on March 6, 2025, responded later that day expressing appreciation but informing the parties that April 18th would not work for The Whaley Law Firm\u2019s office. She explained that motions are filed as late as the Wednesday before deposition dates, so the firm tries to avoid scheduling on Mondays in Jefferson County and Fridays in Fayette County. She asked Katie Watts to provide another set of dates for review and noted her role as Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with new contact information: Sarena Tuttle, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with an emphasis on the new email address.\n\nThe thread also contains an initial line listing possible deposition dates: April 22, 23, 24 or April 29, 20, or May 1. Katie Watts\u2019s subsequent reply proposed additional dates for consideration (April 8, 9, 15, 17, and 18) and asked Mr. Gowen to confirm which of those would work. The exchange underscores the parties\u2019 effort to accommodate Mr. Young\u2019s schedule (noting that he is a 3rd-shift worker who is difficult to reach during business hours) and to avoid court deadlines that could affect motion practice, while reserving the 1:30 p.m. start time and ensuring the deposition is scheduled at least three weeks out.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Estate-of-Evangeline-Young-MVA-8-12-2023. Client: Estate of Evangeline Young. This note covers deposition scheduling in the matter Young v Derby City Gaming LLC, et al.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, Scott Gowen of FMD Legal emailed Katie Watts of PPOA Law, with cc\u2019s to Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, Debbie Allen and Bryce Koon of PPOA, and Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm. In that message, sent from Gowen\u2019s iPad, Gowen said he could do deposition sessions on April 22\u201324. The email was part of the ongoing scheduling discussion for the estate\u2019s deposition in the case.\n\nKatie Watts replied later that day, indicating availability options of April 22, 23, or 24, or alternatively April 29, 2025, or May 1. The message appears to reflect a preliminary list of dates for consideration.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, had explained that April 18th would not work for their office. She noted that motions are filed as late as the Wednesday before and that they try to avoid scheduling on Mondays (Jefferson County) and Fridays (Fayette County). She asked Katie Watts to provide another set of dates for review and reminded them to cc her on future correspondence for faster updates. In her signature, she provided her contact details and new email address.\n\nIn a subsequent reply, Scott Gowen corrected the spelling of his name, noting that it is Gowen, not Gowan, and stated that of the dates previously suggested, he could only do April 18. This message was sent at 11:55 AM from Gowen, again noting it was sent from his iPad.\n\nKatie Watts then responded at 11:46 AM, listing available dates as April 8, 9, 15, 17, and 18, and asked Gowen to confirm which of those would work and to confirm his availability as well.\n\nSarena Tuttle responded at 12:07 PM, thanking them and reiterating that April 18th does not work for their office. She again noted the scheduling constraint about motions and the preferencing to avoid Mondays and Fridays, and she again asked if there was another set of dates they could review.\n\nFinally, Gowen replied at 6:53 PM that he could accommodate depositions on April 22\u201324. In a later exchange (the same day), Katie Watts reiterated the set of potential dates: April 22, 23, 24, or April 29, 2025, or May 1.\n\nAdditional context from the chain includes that the deposition start time was discussed as 1:30 p.m. for availability planning, Mr. Young is a third-shift worker making daytime contact challenging, and the parties prefer to schedule well in advance (at least three weeks out). The communications also reference that motions can be filed as late as the Wednesday before a hearing, influencing the scheduling approach. The correspondence includes the following contact details and signatures: Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address). Scott Gowen\u2019s messages originated from Gowen at FMD Legal (sgowen@fmdlegal.com) and Katie Watts\u2019s replies came from PPOA Law (Kwatts@ppoalaw.com), with Debbie Allen (dallen@ppoalaw.com), Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com), and Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) CC\u2019d on the thread.",

The message thread centers on arranging a deposition with the aim of a 1:30 p.m. start time, to be scheduled at least three weeks out due to Mr. Young\u2019s third-shift work schedule. Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, asked to be copied on all future correspondence and stated they would forward the proposed dates to Mr. Young and update the recipients as soon as possible. Her contact information and the note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS\u201d were included in her signature.\n\nThe scheduling discussion began with Katie Watts, a partner, replying later that day with available dates: April 8, 9, 15, 17, and 18, and she requested confirmation of Mr. Gowen\u2019s availability. Scott Gowen responded, noting that of the proposed dates he could only do April 18, and he also corrected the spelling of his name, reminding everyone that it is Gowen, not Gowan. This exchange occurred in the afternoon, with Gowen signaling availability for April 18 only.\n\nSarena then responded that April 18 would not work for their office. She explained that motions are filed as late as the Wednesday before, and as a result they try to avoid scheduling on Mondays in Jefferson County and Fridays in Fayette County. She asked Katie Watts to propose another set of available dates for review. Watts replied with a new set of potential dates: April 22, 23, 24, or April 29, 20, or May 1. Gowen followed up with another reply stating he could do April 22\u201324, which aligned with Watts\u2019s proposed window.\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications demonstrated the parties\u2019 efforts to accommodate Mr. Young\u2019s schedule and the court\u2019s motion timelines, with adjustments to preferred dates and a clarification of the correct surname spelling. The thread closed with Sarena\u2019s sign-off and a reiteration of the new email address and contact details for future correspondence.",

      "natural_language": "In the estate matter Estate of Evangeline Young, arising from a motor vehicle accident on August 12, 2023, the case Young v Derby City Gaming LLC, et al. proceeded to deposition scheduling discussions in early 2025. The participants included Katie Watts, a partner at PPOA Law, whose direct line is (502) 560-9949 and whose email is kwatts@ppoalaw.com; Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers\u2019 Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, whose contact details in the thread were D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (with a note to \u201cPLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS\u201d); Scott Gowen of FMD Legal (sgowen@fmdlegal.com); Debbie Allen (dallen@ppoalaw.com); Bryce Koon (bryce@whaleylawfirm.com); and Aaron Whaley (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com). The exchange began with a March\u2013April 2025 deposition scheduling conversation and culminated in a firm notice for a deposition on May 30, 2025 at 1:30 p.m. at Katie Watts\u2019s office.\n\nThe first substantive message in this thread is from March 6, 2025 at 11:05 a.m., when Sarena Tuttle emailed Katie Watts (and copied Scott Gowen, Debbie Allen, Bryce Koon, and Aaron Whaley) to acknowledge the delay and to coordinate dates for a 1:30 p.m. start at least three weeks out, noting that Mr. Young is a 3rd shift worker and that they would update as soon as possible after sending dates to Mr. Young. In that same exchange, Scott Gowen replied at 1:53 p.m. indicating that he could do April 22\u201324, and he asked to be addressed with the correct spelling of his name as Gowen (not Gowan).\n\nKatie Watts replied at 11:46 a.m. on March 6 with availability for April 8, 9, 15, 17, and 18, asking Mr. Gowen to confirm his availability as well. Scott Gowen responded again at 11:55 a.m. stating that of those dates he could only do April 18, and he again reminded about the correct spelling Gowen. Sarena Tuttle then followed at 12:07 p.m. with a note of thanks and a commitment to send the proposed dates to Mr. Young and provide updates as soon as possible.\n\nBy March 31, 2025 at 2:00 p.m., Katie Watts asked Sarena for any update. On April 1, 2025, at 10:44 a.m., Sarena replied apologetically and stated that Mr. Young would be available April 22, 2025, at 1:30 p.m. and that they were open to using Katie Watts\u2019s office if that arrangement was acceptable to Mr. Gowen and to Katie. In a following message the same day at 10:48 a.m., Sarena added that they were available for deposition on May 30 or June 18, indicating two alternative dates for scheduling.\n\nFinally, on April 2, 2025 at 8:14 p.m. UTC, Katie Watts informed Sarena and the others that they would notice for May 30 at 1:30 p.m. at Katie Watts\u2019s office. Katie\u2019s note concluded with her signature, identifying her as a Partner and providing her direct line again.\n\nThus, after a back-and-forth regarding preferred start times and dates that accommodated Mr. Young\u2019s 3rd-shift schedule and the parties\u2019 motions practice considerations (noting that motions can be filed as late as the Wednesday before a deposition and that Mondays in Jefferson County and Fridays in Fayette County are generally avoided), the deposition for Young v Derby City Gaming LLC, et al. was scheduled to be noticed for May 30, 2025 at 1:30 p.m., to be held at Katie Watts\u2019s office.",
