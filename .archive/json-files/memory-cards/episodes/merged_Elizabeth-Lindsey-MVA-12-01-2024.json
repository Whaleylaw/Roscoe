      "natural_language": "Case: Elizabeth-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024\n\nElizabeth Lindsey, the client in the Elizabeth-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024 motor vehicle accident matter, was in communication with Whaley Law Firm on March 31, 2025. Jessa Galosmo emailed Elizabeth to explain that hospital bills must be paid by Elizabeth’s health insurance, and that PIP would only be used if the health insurer denies the claim. Jessa also offered that Elizabeth could call Justin the next day to review the details, providing Justin’s direct line: (502) 450-9495.\n\nLater that day, Elizabeth replied, asking for help in getting their claims to go against their PIP and requesting information on the next steps in the process.\n\nOn March 31, 2025, Chandler Wolfe, a Branch claims representative for ky/PA regional PIP, forwarded a message to Elizabeth noting that there is an attorney on file for her claim and that she should address any questions and concerns with that attorney directly; he also cc’d the attorney’s office. Wolfe provided his contact information: p: 800.346.0346 ext. 54628; f: 517.886.8754; e: KentuckyPIP.clm@aoins.com; hours: 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. EST. He also indicated that there is a Customer Center where the client can access her claim information anytime, anywhere.\n\nThat same day, Elizabeth sent a separate message to Chandler Lindsey with the subject line Re: Claim number: 300-0793616-2024, stating, “Hello, Just wanted to follow up on this email. Can you please review and respond to the questions below? Thank you, Elizabeth.” The thread includes an earlier message from Elizabeth dated March 27, 2025 at 12:55 p.m., in which she wrote to Chandler to obtain information about claims submitted against their case (claim number 300-0793616-2024). She asked whether Cincinnati Children’s Hospital had submitted medical claims against their PIP and whether any claims had been received for Owen Lindsey and Chase Lindsey. She also asked whether there were any claims from the University of Cincinnati Hospital for Elizabeth, and she requested guidance on any additional information that might be needed. She provided her contact number: 502-210-8328.\n\nThe exchange closed with Jessa Galosmo’s signature on the communications, listing Whaley Law Firm contact details: Ph: (502) 357-9975; Fax: (502) 364-9363.",
