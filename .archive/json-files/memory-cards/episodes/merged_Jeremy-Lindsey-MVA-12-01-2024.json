      "natural_language": "Case: Jeremy-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024. Client: Jeremy Lindsey. This note summarizes an external email thread concerning the Lindsey Family case number 24-902741838, in which Jeremy Lindsey is the client in a motor vehicle accident matter dated December 1, 2024.\n\nThe thread begins with an email dated February 20, 2025, from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (address: 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022; agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) to Jennifer Howard, a Senior Claims Specialist at Progressive Direct Insurance Company (PO Box 94670, Cleveland, OH 44101-9919; phone 859-629-4740; fax 833-905-1745; Jennifer_Howard@progressive.com), with Jeremy Lindsey copied to the Filevine project email address JeremyLindseyMVAZ4830966@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The subject of the message is “[EXTERNAL] Lindsey Family #24-902741838.” In this message, Whaley explained that there is a policy limits issue in the case because there are five total injury claims. He stated that he represents four of the five, all within the same family—a husband, a wife, and their two kids. He proposed preserving one of Progressive’s two policy limits for some distribution to Dominic, asserting that Dominic would not be entitled to the other policy limit. He asked Jennifer to provide the limits so they could determine a way to tender one of the limits to the Lindsey family and then wait for Dominic to decide what to do with the other limit. Whaley included his contact information again at the end of the message.\n\nOn February 21, 2025, Jennifer Howard replied. She acknowledged that she had this on her calendar to review the following Tuesday regarding settlement proposals for all involved parties and said she would reach out then to discuss further. Her signature identified her as Jennifer Howard, Claims Specialist-Sr., Progressive Direct Insurance Company, with the following contact details: PO Box 94670, Cleveland, OH 44101-9919; work phone 859-629-4740; fax 833-905-1745. The message was part of the same external thread concerning Lindsey Family #24-902741838.\n\nA follow-up email from Aaron Whaley was sent on February 20, 2025 at 2:29 PM (in the thread, this is the original message that preceded Jennifer’s February 21 response). In that message, Whaley reiterated the policy-limits issue, clarified that he represents four of the five injuries within the same family (husband, wife, and their two kids), and discussed preserving one of Progressive’s two policy limits for distribution to Dominic. He stated that Dominic would not be entitled to the other policy limit and asked Jennifer to disclose the policy limits so they could tender one of them to the Lindseys and then await Dominic’s decision regarding the other limit. Whaley provided his contact information again.\n\nThe chain continues with a note on March 10, 2025, around 11:38 AM, from Aaron Whaley to Jennifer Howard (the exact phrasing in the header shows a request: “Jennifer, have you had a chance to take a look at this?”). This indicates a follow-up inquiry after Jennifer’s February 21 response, asking whether she had reviewed the matter.\n\nFinally, on March 13, 2025, at 9:11:28 AM (GMT-04:00), Aaron Whaley sent a closing follow-up with the subject line “Circling back on this.” The email was again addressed to Jennifer Howard, with Jeremy Lindsey copied via the Filevine project email address. The message circulated the same firm contact details for Whaley Law Firm and reiterated the intent to follow up on the Lindsey Family matter. Whaley’s signature again lists the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222) and phone number (502-583-4022).\n\nIn summary, the note documents a back-and-forth with Progressive regarding how to handle policy limits across five injury claims within the Lindsey family, with Whaley representing four of the five claimants, the family structure (husband, wife, two kids), and Dominic as a potential recipient of one policy limit. The exchange includes three main responses: Whaley’s initial limits proposal on February 20, 2025; Jennifer Howard’s plan to review settlement proposals the following Tuesday (February 21, 2025); and subsequent follow-ups by Whaley on March 10 and March 13, 2025, seeking updates and circling back on the matter.",

This is Jeremy Lindsey returning your call. I wanted to provide an update for both Chase and Elizabeth. Chase has a final x ray for his broken collarbone scheduled for april the second and hopefully we get final clearance there. No more treatment is needed. But again, he is scheduled for a final x ray for his collar Bone on april the second. Elizabeth has continued treatment this following Monday, hoping that is going to be her last treatment that is been ongoing for several weeks now. And then she has a final consultation meeting with that orthopedist. I believe it is in early April as well. I can get to the exact date, but hopefully her last treatment and then she will have 1 final assessment as well. So all things considered, assuming there is no changes, we are hoping to have everyone cleared completely in early to mid April. So I will let you know as soon as I know more, but that is the update for now. Thank you. And as always, do not hesitate to reach out to you. Appreciate it.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Jeremy-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024\nClient: Jeremy Lindsey\n\nIn the case of Jeremy Lindsey, arising from a motor vehicle accident on December 1, 2024 (Claim #24-902741838), the file shows a sequence of settlement and lien discussions during mid-April 2025. Beginning with a chain dated April 17, 2025, the parents of the passenger in the insured vehicle agreed to resolve their son’s bodily injury claim for $500, which would leave $45,500 of the $50,000 per-accident coverage to be divided among the Lindsey clients, with the instruction to provide a breakdown for each person so that no individual would receive more than the $25,000 per-person limit.\n\nLater that same day, Jennifer Howard, a Claims Specialist-Senior at Progressive Direct Insurance Company, followed up to clarify and apologize for the earlier message. She explained that settlements are in exchange for a full release of all claims with indemnity and are inclusive of liens but exclusive of PIP. She noted that ERISA liens from Blue Cross and Blue Shield had been received on Jeremy, Chase, and Owen, and offered to email copies of those liens if requested. Her message confirmed that these liens must be addressed as part of the settlement process, and she identified the need for an affidavit regarding the children’s claims. Her contact details were Progressive Direct Insurance Company, PO Box 94670, Cleveland, OH 44101-9919, with a work phone of 859-629-4740 and a fax of 833-905-1745.\n\nEarlier in the same thread, Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm replied to Jennifer. He thanked her for the update and clarification and requested that the ERISA liens be sent so affidavits could be prepared and the settlement breakdown confirmed soon. He asked for clarification as to whether she meant $49,500.\n\nJennifer responded again on April 17, 2025, clarifying her earlier statement. She reiterated that settlements were in exchange for a full release of all claims with indemnity and included liens, but were exclusive of PIP. She informed that ERISA liens had been received from Blue Cross and Blue Shield on Jeremy, Chase, and Owen and that she could email copies of the liens if desired. She also clarified that the plaintiffs in the matter referred to as “the parents of the passenger in our insured’s vehicle” had agreed to resolve their son’s bodily injury claim for $500, which would leave $45,500 out of the $50,000 per-accident coverage to be divided among the Lindsey clients, with the request to determine a breakdown where no one received more than the $25,000 per-person limit.\n\nA subsequent message from Jennifer, sent at 5:39 PM on April 17, 2025, included a note of apology for having sent a prior message too soon. She reiterated that settlements require a full release of all claims with indemnity and are inclusive of liens but exclusive of PIP, and again confirmed the existence of ERISA liens from Blue Cross and Blue Shield on Jeremy, Chase, and Owen, offering to email those liens if requested.\n\nThat evening, at 7:24 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, acknowledging Jennifer’s notes and asking her to send the ERISA liens. He stated that affidavits would be prepared and that the settlement breakdown would be confirmed soon, and he again sought clarification on whether the amount was $49,500.\n\nIn the early hours of April 21, 2025, Jennifer replied that the amount left over for the clients was indeed $49,500, and she attached a letter confirming this figure along with copies of the liens she had received on the clients.\n\nFinally, on April 21, 2025, at 11:02 AM, Aaron Whaley forwarded the exchange to Justin Chumbley and the Jeremy Lindsey Filevine project email address with a note that COOTS letters needed to be sent out on all of the Lindseys. The forwarding included the Whaley Law Firm’s contact information: 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, phone 502-583-4022. The message reflected the ongoing settlement and lien considerations surrounding Claim #24-902741838 in the Jeremy Lindsey MVA file.",

      "natural_language": "In the file for the case Jeremy-Lindsey-MVA-12-01-2024, the client is Jeremy Lindsey. On July 9, 2025, an email chain about unpaid bills and reimbursements began with Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm writing to Jeremy Lindsey (addressed to jeremylindsey1978@yahoo.com) and copied Elizabeth Lindsey and the Filevine project email address, plus the recipient’s file note. The email, sent from Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022, asked, “Can you get me a receipt on the tax bill so I can get you reimbursed for that?”\n\nEarlier that same day, Jeremy Lindsey replied to Aaron, adding Elizabeth “for visibility.” In his message, Jeremy apologized for missing Aaron’s call and expressed appreciation for help with paying the hospital bills. He confirmed that the information previously provided was accurate and that no additional medical services were being provided for any of them. Jeremy also noted that in addition to the medical bills, they had to pay a tax bill on the totaled vehicle amounting to $762.87. According to the county clerk, this tax was owed for 2025 because they possessed the car in the current year and it wasn’t officially totaled until January. He wasn’t sure if this tax could be recovered but wanted to bring it to Aaron’s attention. He acknowledged that the process could take a long time to close and that they simply wanted the medical bills paid so they would stop receiving calls. He thanked Aaron for the support since December and offered to help with anything else, signing the message, “Thanks, Jeremy,” and noting it was sent from Yahoo Mail for iPhone.\n\nEarlier that afternoon, at 2:50 PM, Aaron Whaley had emailed Jeremy to confirm the outstanding bills he saw. He listed: $939.10 to UC for Elizabeth, $1,070.27 to Cincinnati Children’s for Chase, and $4,080.00 to Cincinnati Children’s for Owen. Aaron asked if these were all the outstanding bills and said he would have Auto Owners process them as soon as possible. He inquired whether there were any additional outstanding items and also asked for updates on medical treatment and follow-up visits. Specifically, he asked whether Owen had any follow-up visits after December 11, and noted that Chase’s last known visit was on April 2. The email concluded with Aaron’s contact information: Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.",
