      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise file dated 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: Mills v. Forcht Bank; Knox Circuit Court; Case No.: 20-CI-00112.\n\nThis note records a sequence of email exchanges in January 2022 among counsel and staff regarding the Knox Circuit Court case Mills v. Forcht Bank. The participants include Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com), Betsy R. Catron, Associate Attorney at WHT Law (Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Lexington, KY 40507), Renee Day (Legal Assistant to Betsy Catron and colleagues), and others CC’d on the thread, including Sarena Tuttle and the Amy Mills Premise email alias. Aaron also notes his new email address in the thread. The subject line repeatedly refers to Mills v. Forcht Bank, Knox Circuit Court, Case No. 20-CI-00112.\n\nOn January 11, 2022, at 4:07 PM, Renee Day sent an email to counsel attaching the Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel Only that had been filed with the court that afternoon in the above-referenced case, asking to (please) let them know if there were questions or concerns. Later that same day, at 4:23 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to Betsy Catron (and cc’d Renee Day and agwhaley@louisville-accident-lawyer.com), joking, “I am not lazy but care to draft? You can bill that.” On January 11 at 6:12 PM, Betsy Catron responded, “That is fine with me.”\n\nAt 10:03 PM on January 11, 2022, Aaron Whaley sent another message to Betsy Catron (cc’ing Renee Day and agwhaley@louisville-accident-lawyer.com) noting: “Received, thank you. I know the Court won't let us extend the deadline by agreed order but you want to file something like a ‘Proposed Agreed Order’? It is just an Agreed Order along with a Motion to adopt. As grounds we can say that Plaintiff has only recently been released from active treatment and extending the deadlines another 6 months will allow counsel to complete record retrieval, consult experts and mediate the case. Something like that.” \n\nEarlier that same day, January 11, at 4:23 PM, Renee Day had been corresponding about the matter, and at 4:07 PM she had advised that the Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel Only had been filed with the court earlier that afternoon. Betsy Catron replied later that day (at 6:12 PM) that this approach was acceptable.\n\nThe following day, January 12, 2022, at 7:21 PM Betsy Catron wrote: “No problem. I’ll get it done tomorrow. Thanks!” and signed her message as Associate Attorney from Vine Center.\n\nOn January 13, 2022, at 2:48 PM Betsy Catron sent, “Hi Aaron – please see attached. Let me know if you approve to file.” In that message she again referenced the attachment and sought approval to file the proposed course of action. Aaron Whaley responded about five minutes later (at 2:53:30 PM) with, “Looks good, Note my new email address. Thanks.”\n\nThroughout the thread, standard firm contact details and disclosures appeared in signatures, including the Vine Center address and phone numbers, and the typical confidentiality notice was included in the messages from Renee Day. The thread confirms the progression toward filing an agreed order and a motion to adopt, with the goal of extending deadlines to permit record retrieval, expert consultation, and mediation, in connection with Mills v. Forcht Bank, Knox Circuit Court, Case No. 20-CI-00112.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills premises file dated 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: FW: Mills v. Forcht Bank; Knox Circuit Court; Case No. 20-CI-00112. This record is drawn from an email thread in January 2022 among Amy Mills’ counsel and their colleagues, regarding the Mills v. Forcht Bank case in Knox Circuit Court, and specifically about drafting and filing a proposed order to extend deadlines, as well as updates on court scheduling.\n\nThe chain begins with an email exchange on January 11–13, 2022 among Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), Betsy Catron (Whitt, Catron & Henderson / WHTLaw), Renee Day (legal assistant to several colleagues), and others cc’d in the thread, including Sarena Tuttle and Amy Mills’ Filevine recipient. In one early exchange, Aaron Whaley wrote on January 11, 2022 at 4:23 PM to Betsy Catron and Renee Day (and cc’d others) that he was not lazy but would be willing to draft, and that she could bill that time. Betsy Catron replied on January 11 at 6:12 PM that “That is fine with me.” Later that same evening, at 10:03 PM, Whaley reiterated the sentiment about drafting.\n\nEarlier that day, Renee Day sent a message (January 11 at 4:07 PM) to counsel attaching the Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel Only that had been filed with the court in the above-referenced case, asking to be informed if there were questions or concerns. The thread shows Betsy Catron’s replying correspondence over the next days. On January 12, 2022 at 7:21 PM Betsy Catron wrote, “No problem. I’ll get it done tomorrow. Thanks!” and included her standard firm signature and contact information.\n\nOn January 11, 2022 at 4:23 PM, Aaron had also exchanged messages with Renee Day and others about the approach to filing, specifically suggesting the possibility of a “Proposed Agreed Order” accompanied by a Motion to Adopt, and outlining grounds such as the Plaintiff having recently been released from active treatment and the need for more time to retrieve records, consult experts, and mediate. He noted that while the Court would not extend deadlines by agreed order, they could pursue such a filing with the appropriate grounds.\n\nOn January 13, 2022, Betsy Catron indicated progress by writing at 2:48 PM: “Hi Aaron – please see attached. Let me know if you approve to file.” Aaron Whaley responded at 2:54 PM: “Looks good, Note my new email address. Thanks.” The thread shows that Aaron’s new email address was agwhaley@louisville-accident-lawyer.com, and Betsy acknowledged approval to file the attached materials. The email traffic on January 11–13 also includes Betsy’s prior communications in which she indicated she would handle the filing the following day, with Aaron later confirming his new contact address.\n\nOver the ensuing days, the thread includes Renee Day’s communications and standard firm email footers, including the confidentiality notice and multiple cautionary notes regarding external emails. The thread also shows the firm’s ongoing exchange about drafting and filing the necessary documents to extend deadlines and adopt an agreed order.\n\nOn January 19, 2022, Betsy Catron sent an email noting a development from the Knox Circuit Court Clerk’s office: “Judge Caperton’s Knox Circuit Court has been cancelled for tomorrow 1/20/22. All cases will be rescheduled for 2/14/22 at the regular time. If you have any questions, please call the clerk’s office at 546 3075.” Aaron Whaley replied with a brief, handwritten sentiment: “thank god.” Betsy then circulated the update to the chain, and the matter remained pending in light of the rescheduling.\n\nIn sum, the January 2022 correspondence reflects a coordinated effort among Amy Mills’ counsel and associated staff to draft and file a proposed agreed order to extend deadlines in Mills v. Forcht Bank (Knox Circuit Court, Case No. 20-CI-00112), with discussions about extending deadlines by six months to complete record retrieval, consult experts, and mediate, alongside the procedural steps already taken (including the withdrawal of a prior motion to compel), and an interim court scheduling change due to cancellation of a hearing scheduled for January 20, 2022, with the next date set for February 14, 2022 at the regular time. The thread includes references to the parties’ drafting and filing process, the new contact information for Aaron Whaley, and the various cc’d participants and assistants, as well as the standard firm email disclosures and external email cautions.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents an email thread about the Mills v. Forcht Bank matter in Knox Circuit Court, Case No. 20-CI-00112, on behalf of client Amy Mills. The involved parties were Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and Betsy R. Catron of Vine Center/WHT Law, with Sarena Tuttle and the Amy Mills Filevine alias copied on various messages.\n\nOn January 19, 2022, Aaron Whaley sent the latest message in the thread to Betsy Catron, with Sarena Tuttle and Amy Mills’ Filevine address CC’d, and the subject line referencing Mills v. Forcht Bank and the Knox Circuit Court case. In his email, Whaley wrote a single line: “thank god.” This followed Betsy Catron’s earlier note about the Knox Circuit Court scheduling issue (described below).\n\nEarlier in the week, Betsy Catron had written on January 19, 2022 at 3:01 PM that she had just seen a posting on the Knox Circuit Court Clerk’s Facebook page informing that Judge Caperton’s Knox Circuit Court had been cancelled for January 20, 2022. All cases would be rescheduled for February 14, 2022 at the regular time, and she provided the clerk’s office phone number (546 3075) for questions. She signed as Betsy R. Catron, Associate Attorney at Vine Center, with the firm’s Lexington, Kentucky contact details.\n\nThe thread shows a longer back-and-forth spanning January 11–13, 2022, concerning filing documents and drafting. On January 13, 2022 at 2:54 PM, Aaron noted his new email address and said, “Looks good, Note my new email address. Thanks.” Earlier that same day, at 2:48 PM, Betsy had written, “Hi Aaron – please see attached. Let me know if you approve to file.” The previous day, January 12, 2022 at 7:21 PM, Betsy had responded, “No problem. I’ll get it done tomorrow. Thanks!” On January 11, 2022 at 10:03 PM, Aaron had quipped, “I am not lazy but care to draft? You can bill that. ????,” to which Betsy had replied earlier that day, “That is fine with me.” Earlier still, at 4:23 PM on January 11, 2022, Renee Day had forwarded to counsel the attached Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel Only that had been filed with the court that afternoon, inviting any questions or concerns. Renee Day signed as Legal Assistant to Jillian House, Betsy Catron, Catie Coldiron Joseph, and Kaylee Collins, at the Vine Center, with the firm’s standard disclaimer at the bottom of the message.\n\nIn the sequence of these communications, Betsy later confirmed, “No problem. I’ll get it done tomorrow. Thanks!” and the correspondence continued toward filing an item described as a “Proposed Agreed Order” and a “Motion to adopt.” Aaron had suggested drafting such an Agreed Order, with grounds stating that the plaintiff had only recently been released from active treatment and that extending deadlines by another six months would allow counsel to complete record retrieval, consult experts, and mediate the case. The exchange noted that the court would not permit extending the deadline via an agreed order, and they discussed filing the Proposed Agreed Order along with the Motion to adopt.\n\nThe sequence also includes a formal attachment in Renee Day’s January 11, 2022 email, which is the Notice of Withdrawal of Motion to Compel Only, filed with the court in the above-referenced case. The thread closes with the standard firm email signatures and confidentiality notices. The final details show Aaron Whaley at Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, with his contact information provided for further correspondence.",

Based upon our previous discussions, it appears your client's last treatment was December 16, 2021. Please advise if she does continue any fall-related treatment.\n\nNext, as you had previously advised that your client was making a claim for impairment of her ability to earn money in the future, we will need her tax returns as requested in discovery. We are missing returns for the years 2016, 2018, and 2020. Please provide those to me as soon as possible.\n\nLastly, once you have had an opportunity to review the new deadlines, give me a call to let me know what your thoughts are with regard to setting the case for mediation.\n\nThank you,\n\nBetsy R.

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank – Knox Circuit II – Mediation Scheduling. Client: Amy Mills.

The dates and key points are as follows.\n\nOn February 23, 2022, Sarena M. Tuttle sent an email to Betsy Catron requesting mediation in the above-referenced cases and asking if the parties were agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator, along with available dates. If Hon. Knopf was not agreeable, she requested a selection of other mediators. The message noted that the 2018 tax documents were attached, and that their client stated she did not file a tax return in 2020 because she did not work due to the accident, with trouble locating 2016 tax documents. The email stated that if the 2016 documents were located, they would be forwarded upon receipt, and asked Betsy Catron to advise whether Hon. Thomas Knopf was acceptable and what dates were available. The message concluded with a note of willingness to work toward an amicable resolution for all parties involved and provided contact details for Sarena: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: (502) 365-9435; O: (502) 583-4022; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; with a parenthetical note: PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS. The email chain also included external email caution banners: “External Email: Please use caution when opening attachments and links from external senders.”\n\nOn March 4, 2022, Sarena Tuttle again wrote Betsy Catron. She stated that 2018 tax documents were attached and explained that their client did not file a 2020 tax return due to not working because of the accident, and that locating 2016 tax documents was proving difficult; if the 2016 documents could be located, they would be forwarded upon receipt. In the meantime, Sarena asked Betsy to advise whether they were agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator and to share available dates; if Hon. Knopf was not agreeable, to provide a selection of other mediators. The email closed with a forward-looking note about reaching an amicable resolution and an invitation to contact for further discussion. Sarena’s signature again included The Whaley Law Firm details and a reminder of the new email address (PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS).\n\nEarlier still, on March 10, 2022 at 1:39 PM, Betsy Catron replied. She apologized for the delayed response and stated that WHT Law was agreeable to Judge Knopf as the mediator. She asked Sarena whether they could attempt a July mediation and thanked her.\n\nLater that same day, March 10, 2022 at 2:40 PM, Sarena Tuttle responded. She acknowledged the tax document issue and said she would review the file again. In the meantime, she agreed that July sounded great for mediation, noting that their firm was pretty open that month and believed Judge Knopf was as well. She asked if Betsy had any preferred dates.\n\nFinally, on March 11, 2022 at 3:33 PM UTC, Betsy Catron replied: “We are pretty open right now. Anytime after July 11 should be fine, except for July 19.” Her message closed with her standard signature block, including the Vine Center address at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, phone number 859.422.6000, fax 859.422.6001, and the website www.whtlaw.com.\n\nNotes of the participants’ signatures show the following details.

Thomas Knopf (Hon. Thomas Knopf/Judge Knopf) identified as the preferred mediator, and a scheduling window that becomes available after July 11, with the exception of July 19. The discussions included references to tax documents (2018 attached, 2020 non-filing due to not working from the accident, difficulty locating 2016) and a plan to forward missing documents if located.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, Knox Circuit II, Mediation Scheduling. Client: Amy Mills. The matter centers on arranging mediation for the above-referenced case, with the discussions spanning February and March 2022 between Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm and Betsy R. Catron of WHT Law, regarding a mediator, dates, and logistical details.\n\nThe scheduling dialogue began with an email from Sarena Tuttle dated February 23, 2022. In that message, she thanked Mrs. Catron for the opportunity to schedule mediation and asked whether the office would be agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator, and what dates were available. If Knopf were not agreeable, she requested a selection of alternative mediators. She noted that the client’s 2018 tax documents were attached and indicated that Amy Mills did not file a tax return in 2020 because she was not working due to the accident, and she was having trouble locating 2016 tax documents; if 2016 documents could be located, they would be forwarded upon receipt. She concluded by expressing a desire to work toward an amicable resolution and invited further questions. The email included contact details for Sarena M. Tuttle and carried a note about the new email address.\n\nA follow-up email from Sarena Tuttle on March 4, 2022 reiterated the request to schedule mediation and confirmed the attachment of the 2018 Tax Documents. She again explained that Amy Mills did not file in 2020 due to not working after the accident and was having trouble locating 2016 documents, with a commitment to forward 2016 documents if located. Sarena asked whether the office was agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as mediator and requested available dates; if Knopf was not agreeable, she asked for a selection of other mediators. She closed with a positive note about working toward an amicable resolution and encouraged direct contact for questions. This March 4 email was CC’d to Aaron Whaley and included the case file email address AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Betsy Catron replied that WHT Law was agreeable to Judge Knopf and asked whether July mediation could be attempted. Separately that same day, Sarena Tuttle acknowledged receipt of the tax documents, apologized for any confusion, and stated that she would review the file again. She indicated that July sounded great for mediation, that they were pretty open that month, and that she believed Judge Knopf was as well. She asked if there were any specific dates preferred.\n\nLater that day, Betsy responded that they were pretty open, with availability anytime after July 11, and that July 19 should be avoided. On March 11, 2022, Sarena proposed July 14, 2022 as a great day and asked whether a full-day or half-day would be necessary, noting a preference for the afternoon if a half-day was acceptable.\n\nFinally, on March 11, 2022 at 16:52:45, Betsy confirmed that July 14, 2022 could work and indicated that a half-day would be sufficient, with the afternoon also being acceptable. The correspondence closed with Betsy’s standard contact information and the firm’s branding.\n\nIn summary, the parties pursued mediation scheduling for Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank before Hon. Thomas Knopf, with July 14, 2022 identified as the preferred date and a preference for a half-day session in the afternoon, while remaining flexible about the exact duration. The exchange also documented the client’s tax document status (2018 provided; 2020 not filed due to lack of work; 2016 to be located if possible) and included the attachment of the 2018 tax documents in the March 4 communications.",

      "natural_language": "In the case of Amy Mills v Forcht Bank, Knox Circuit II, mediation was being scheduled in 2022. The client is Amy Mills. The Whaley Law Firm, represented by Sarena M. Tuttle, coordinated the mediation scheduling with Betsy R. Catron, Associate Attorney at Vine Center. The communication trail began with requests to confirm a mediator and to gather available dates, with Hon. Thomas J. Knopf proposed as the mediator and other mediators to be offered if Knopf was not agreeable. The parties discussed July as a potential mediation month, with a preference for afternoons and half-day sessions if possible. The email chain shows input from multiple participants and includes a note that the Notice of Mediation would be attached when finalized, and that the mediation would be conducted via Zoom, with Zoom login details to be provided by the National Arbitration and Dispute Association (NADA) closer to the date. The correspondence also included copies to NADA so that they could be cc’d on any mediation-related communications.\n\nChronologically, on February 23, 2022, Sarena Tuttle sent a message to Betsy Catron asking whether the office was agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator and requesting available dates, with a suggestion to provide alternatives if Knopf was not agreeable. The message, which cautioned recipients about external emails, also indicated the correspondence would be forwarded to a wider audience, including Aaron Whaley and the Amy Mills filevine address, and noted that NADA would be cc’d on mediation communications. On March 4, 2022, Sarena followed up with attached 2018 Tax Documents; she explained that Amy Mills did not file a 2020 tax return because she did not work due to the accident and that she was having trouble locating 2016 tax documents; if the 2016 documents were located, they would be forwarded. She asked Betsy to indicate whether Hon. Thomas Knopf was agreeable as mediator and which dates were available, and if Knopf was not agreeable, to propose other mediators. This message also included the Whaley Firm’s contact details and stated that they looked forward to an amicable resolution.\n\nOn March 10, 2022, Betsy replied that she was agreeable to Judge Knopf and asked whether July mediation would work, noting they were pretty open and suggesting a half-day in the afternoon if possible. Later that same day, Sarena responded that July sounded great and asked Betsy to confirm whether a full day or half day would be needed, reiterating a preference for an afternoon half-day. By March 11, 2022, Betsy stated that they were good with July 14, 2022 and that a half-day would be fine, with the afternoon also acceptable. Sarena then confirmed that she would get the mediation scheduled and noticed.\n\nSubsequently, on March 11, 2022 at 12:43 PM, Sarena sent a final, formal notice confirming the mediation details: Hon. Thomas J. Knopf would serve as mediator for Amy Mills v Forcht Bank, with the mediation set for July 14, 2022 at 1:30 PM via Zoom. The Notice of Mediation would be provided by the NADA, which would supply Zoom information closer to the mediation date. The Whaley Law Firm reported that the NADA had been provided Amy Mills’ contact information to cc them on any mediation correspondence.

      "natural_language": "The case at hand is Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, Knox Cir II, with mediation scheduling discussions spanning February and March 2022 between The Whaley Law Firm and the Vine Center, on behalf of Amy Mills. The participants in the emails were Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm and Betsy R. Catron, Associate Attorney at Vine Center, with the matter noted as Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019 and client Amy Mills. Sarena’s signature repeatedly notes the Whaley Firm’s Louisville office and includes a new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with direct-dial and main phone numbers.\n\nOn February 23, 2022, Sarena opened the mediation scheduling discussion with Betsy Catron, asking whether the parties were agreeable to Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator and requesting available dates. She also asked Betsy to provide a selection of alternative mediators if Knopf was not agreeable. Sarena’s email included guidance about external emails and attached her firm’s contact information.\n\nIn a March 4, 2022 email, Sarena advised that she had attached the 2018 tax documents requested. She explained that Amy Mills did not file a tax return in 2020 because she did not work due to the accident and that Mills was having trouble locating 2016 tax documents; if Mills located the 2016 documents, they would be forwarded. She reiterated the request for consent to Judge Knopf as mediator and asked what dates were available, inviting Betsy to provide a selection of other mediators if Knopf was not agreeable. The message closed with the standard offer to discuss any questions further and repeated the contact details for Sarena and her new email address.\n\nBy March 10, 2022, Betsy replied that they were agreeable to Judge Knopf and asked whether a July mediation could be scheduled. The exchange continued with Sarena acknowledging the need to review the tax documents and confirming that July appeared to be a suitable month for mediation, noting that her office was fairly flexible that month and that they believed Judge Knopf was as well. She also asked whether Betsy had any specific dates in mind.\n\nLater that same day, March 10, Sarena responded again, stating that July sounded great for mediation and that her team was open to scheduling within that month and believed Judge Knopf was as well. She asked Betsy to share any specific date preferences.\n\nOn March 11, Betsy replied that they were pretty open after July 11, with the exception of July 19. She asked for confirmation of availability and continued the dialogue about July mediation.\n\nThat same day, March 11, at 11:03 a.m., Sarena proposed July 14, 2022, as a target date, asking whether a half-day would be sufficient or if they would prefer a full day. She indicated a preference for the afternoon if a half-day schedule was acceptable.\n\nAt 11:52 a.m. on March 11, Betsy confirmed that they were good with July 14 and that a half-day would be fine, with the afternoon also acceptable.\n\nFinally, at 12:04 p.m. on March 11, Sarena expressed appreciation and stated that she would get the mediation scheduled and noticed. She signed off with her contact information once again, reinforcing that the arrangement would be set and communicated to the parties involved.\n\nIn sum, the parties converged on Hon. Thomas Knopf as the mediator, settled on July 14, 2022 for a mediation session, and negotiated a preferred half-day timeframe in the afternoon, with both sides indicating flexibility around exact timing and confirming the plan to schedule and notice the mediation accordingly.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn the matter of a NeuroSurgery Appointment, correspondence between Amy Mills and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm occurred in April and May of 2022 regarding updated neurosurgical imaging as recommended by Dr. Gregory Nazar. On April 26, 2022, Sarena sent Amy an email instructing her to contact her neurosurgery provider to request updated imaging per Dr. Nazar’s addendum (which Sarena attached for the provider’s review). The message also included Sarena’s contact information and a note to reference her new email address, with the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky location and phone numbers.\n\nLater on April 26, 2022, Amy replied that May 3rd at 5:30 p.m. would be her first available appointment, and she would send a follow-up email attached to let Sarena know when the MRI appointment set up by her neuro team would occur. She expressed thanks. Sarena responded to that update later that day with, “Sounds good, thank you,” and signed off with her firm’s details, including address, direct and office phone numbers, and her new email address.\n\nOn May 6, 2022, at 8:46 a.m., Amy wrote again, stating that she had attended her appointment with Teresa on Tuesday, and Teresa had ordered the necessary scans, but they had not yet been able to schedule her in; she noted that they were cutting the appointment with the neurosurgery doctor close and asked whether they should reschedule that appointment for not this coming week but the next, or something else.\n\nLater that same day, at 9:14 a.m., Amy provided an update that she had just scheduled the MRI-related appointment for May 26, 2022, at 1:30 p.m. She explained that the imaging center is very backed up and that she would need three procedures conducted together, which would take longer; that timing reflects the earliest availability she could secure at the diagnostic center to obtain the MRI.",

      "natural_language": "This note covers communications between Amy Mills and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding Amy’s neuroSurgery appointment and related imaging. The thread begins with an email from Sarena on April 26, 2022, in which she advised Amy to contact her neurosurgery provider and request updated imaging as recommended by Dr. Gregory Nazar, attaching a copy of Dr. Nazar’s addendum for the physician’s review. In reply, later that same day, Amy indicated that May 3 would be “a week from today” and that May 3 at 5:30 p.m. was her first available slot; she planned to send a follow-up email confirming when her MRI appointment would be set. Sarena acknowledged with “Sounds good, thank you!”\n\nEarlier that same day, Amy had written that the May 3 appointment was the first available, and she intended to send an email attaching the MRI appointment details once they were set. In response, Sarena again confirmed and Amy reiterated her plan to notify once the MRI appointment was scheduled.\n\nSubsequently, on May 6, 2022, Amy reported that she had attended an appointment with Teresa, who ordered the scans but, as of that time, they had not been able to schedule her in yet; Amy asked whether they should reschedule the neurosurgery appointment that week or the following week. Later on May 6, Sarena requested the location information for the scheduled imaging, providing her firm’s Louisville contact details (The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-365-9435; O: 502-583-4022; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com; note the new email address).\n\nAmy answered, informing that the imaging was scheduled for May 26, 2022 at 1:30 p.m. She explained that the imaging center was very backed up and that she would require three scans to be completed together, which would take longer, but that May 26 was the soonest available slot at the diagnostic center to obtain the MRI.\n\nOn May 7, 2022, Amy clarified to Sarena that the imaging center is Corbin Imaging and Diagnostic Center, which is part of Corbin Hospital.\n\nFinally, on May 9, 2022 at 10:20:28 a.m. Eastern Time, Amy reported that the Louisville neuroSurgery appointment had been rescheduled for July 25 at 11:00 a.m. She noted that the clinic had called her back after she had left a message the previous week regarding her MRI appointments and their scheduling. The thread as a whole shows ongoing coordination about updated imaging per Dr. Nazar’s addendum, scheduling updates for MRI imaging (including three scans to be done together at Corbin Imaging and Diagnostic Center on May 26 at 1:30 p.m.), and the rescheduling of the Louisville neuroSurgery appointment to July 25 at 11:00 a.m.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise file dated 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: FCE Appointment Reminder for July 25, 2022 at 11:00 a.m.\n\nBetween July 5 and July 17, 2022, an email thread circulated between Amy Mills and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding an upcoming Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) and related documents. The subject indicated a reminder for an FCE appointment scheduled for July 25, 2022 at 11:00 a.m., to be held at BioKinetics, located at 9900 Corporate Campus Drive, Suite 2400, Louisville, KY 40223. The thread also references HIPAA authorization and requests for updated medical records, as well as a health insurance issue.\n\nOn July 5, 2022, Sarena Tuttle sent Amy Mills appointment details and noted that Amy should execute the HIPAA authorization sent via DocuSign so the firm could obtain updated medical records. Sarena stated she would update Amy as soon as more information became available about the health insurance issue. In her signature, Sarena provided her contact information for The Whaley Law Firm—712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222—with direct and office phone numbers and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, and she reminded that this was a new email address.\n\nOn July 7, 2022 at 2:06 p.m., Amy Mills replied that she believed the information was correct and that she would review it, adding that she would confirm and provide details as she thought she had done so.\n\nLater that same day, at 2:57 p.m., Sarena responded that she appreciated Amy’s note and that the HIPAA document would have come from DocuSign; she offered to resend it in case it had gone to spam.\n\nOn July 11, 2022, at 12:50 p.m., Amy Mills wrote that she believed the DocuSign item had been sent, and that she thought she had signed it, but she would verify and let the firm know if all needed items were in order.\n\nAt 1:00 p.m. that day, Sarena replied that she had received the HIPAA item back and thanked Amy. She then requested confirmation of whether Amy had applied for a PPP loan and, if so, what the outcome was.\n\nOn July 15, 2022, at 11:16 p.m., Amy Mills responded that she thought she had completed what was required but was not completely sure and would check, asking to be informed for certainty and any needed details.\n\nFinally, on July 17, 2022, at 6:41 p.m., Sarena signed off asking Amy to confirm the outcome once more.\n\nSignature blocks in the exchanges repeatedly identified Sarena M. Tuttle as The Whaley Law Firm representative, with the firm’s Louisville address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and contact numbers (D: 502-365-9435; O: 502-583-4022) and Sarena’s email (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com). The thread also shows Amy Mills’ primary contact as bellabeautyinstitute@gmail.com. The messages reference a new email address for Sarena, noted in her signature as part of the firm’s contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, at 10:10 a.m., Amy Mills wrote to Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, asking for an update on progress. In her message, she stated she was glad the PPP loan information had been obtained, noting that since she is no longer in business she would have to file bankruptcy because the loans were based on the 2019 tax year. She also mentioned that she had been able to obtain more PPP funds but was unsure whether she would be medically able to be healed in time to continue. She expressed the view that this information should not be entered into her case, and she complained that she had not been given an updated report for the FCE or its findings. She alleged that the defense was grasping for anything they could to minimize the amount they would have to pay. She referenced an MRI report stating a current acute tear in her arm, but said doctors were not on the same page to obtain treatment. She further asserted that the defendants should be held responsible for medical malpractice due to a misdiagnosis at the initial ER treatment, which she claimed prolonged her treatment, pain, and suffering, and she argued that such consequences would not have happened if the misdiagnosis had not occurred in the first place. She stated that this has been ongoing for almost four years, during which she has had days when she cannot get out of bed and experiences migraines so severe that she feels she is dying. She concluded that she primarily receives medication and continued symptoms but no remedy to the problem. Her signature included the line: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” — Benjamin Franklin.\n\nAt 10:15 a.m. the same day, Sarena responded to Amy, explaining that they had received the FCE Report and that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for their review. She also noted that documents from Hometown Bank regarding Amy’s PPP loans had been received and were under review. She acknowledged that Aaron had been in correspondence with the defense, but she did not have the details of those conversations and would reach out to him for a more detailed update. Her message included the firm’s contact information and a note to their client, including the firm’s Louisville address and phone numbers, and the reminder to note a new email address: sarena@whaleylawfirm.com.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 10:10 a.m., Amy had sent another brief message to Sarena asking for an update on progress, signing as Amy Mills and reiterating the quoted Franklin line in her signature.\n\nLater, at 11:08 a.m., Amy continued to correspond, reiterating her concerns and elaborating on the lack of an updated FCE report and the ongoing dispute over the handling of the PPP loan information, the possibility of bankruptcy based on the 2019 tax year, and the medical issues including the MRI-documented arm tear, the need for coordinated medical treatment, and the alleged medical malpractice stemming from an ER misdiagnosis that she claimed has continued to cause pain and suffering for nearly four years. She reiterated that her condition includes days when she cannot get out of bed and severe migraines, and that she has primarily received medication without a lasting remedy.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, in a communication from Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Amy Mills, the firm acknowledged Amy’s concerns and explained the defense’s rights in this matter. Sarena stated that the defense is entitled to know whether Amy recovered lost wages during her recovery and, if so, from whom. Because Amy had obtained a Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan to cover lost wages, Sarena understood that the defense would not be responsible for those “lost wages,” since they were funded by the loan. The defense would likely have to subrogate, reimbursing Hometown Bank for the funds provided. Sarena also indicated she would forward Amy’s email to Aaron for a more detailed address. She attached a copy of the FCE Report received on August 16, 2022 and apologized for not sending it sooner. The message included the Whaley Law Firm’s contact information and note of Sarena’s new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier that day, at 10:10 AM, Amy Mills had sent a message containing a link: https://www.google.com/maps/search/712get an update on where we r with the progress. She wrote that she was glad the PPP loan information had been obtained, noting that because she was no longer in business, she would have to file bankruptcy since they used 2019 tax year data, and she had also been able to obtain more PPP funds but was not sure whether she would medically be healed in time to continue. Amy asserted that this information should not be brought to the defense or entered into her case. She complained that she had not received an updated FCE report or its findings, and she expressed concern that the defense was “reaching” to find anything at all to reduce payment. She referenced an MRI report indicating a current acute tear in her arm and described difficulty getting doctors aligned to provide treatment. She also claimed potential medical malpractice due to misdiagnosis at her initial ER treatment, which she believed prolonged her pain and suffering, arguing that this would not have happened if the accident had not occurred. She described her situation as ongoing for almost four years, with days when she could not get out of bed and migraines so severe she felt like she was dying, and she lamented that she was receiving only medications and persistent symptoms without a remedy.\n\nAt 10:15 AM, in reply to Amy’s earlier message, Sarena acknowledged receipt of the FCE Report and advised that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for their review. She confirmed that documents from Hometown Bank regarding Amy’s PPP loans had also been received and were under review. Sarena noted that Aaron had been in correspondence with the defense, but she did not have the details of those conversations at that time; she stated she would reach out to him for a more detailed update. The message included Sarena’s signature block with the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222) and direct lines, and again reminded that the new email address should be used.\n\nLater, at 11:08 AM, Amy replied again, reiterating her position that it was beneficial to have the PPP loan information but highlighting personal circumstances. She explained that since she was no longer in business, she would need to consider bankruptcy because of the 2019 tax year, and she noted she had obtained additional PPP funds but remained uncertain about her medical prognosis. She insisted that this information should not affect her case, expressed dissatisfaction with not receiving an updated FCE report or findings, and criticized the defense for trying to locate anything to minimize their liability. She reiterated the MRI findings of a current acute tear in her arm and the lack of consensus among doctors regarding treatment. She pressed for accountability regarding alleged medical malpractice from an initial ER misdiagnosis, asserting that the misdiagnosis had prolonged her pain and suffering. She emphasized the ongoing nature of the ordeal—nearly four years—with days when she cannot get out of bed and debilitating migraines, and she complained that she continues to receive only medication and symptoms without a proper remedy.\n\nThe thread also included the exchange’s closing quotation from Amy Mills, quoting Benjamin Franklin: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” The communication chain reflects the ongoing efforts to update Amy on FCE-related findings, PPP loan documentation, and potential liability considerations, while also documenting Amy’s concerns about medical treatment, alleged medical malpractice, and the impact of these issues on her case. The case file preserves all names, dates, documents, and contact details, including the instructive note about Sarena’s new email address and the various ways to reach the involved parties.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, Amy Mills emailed her attorney, Sarena M. Tuttle, regarding an update in the case. In her message (sent at 1:49:25 PM), Amy explained that she will have to pay bankruptcy because she was unable to keep the business open, and she noted that a bank representative also said the electric bill that had been paid would count toward the balance to be forgiven on the PPP.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 11:36 AM, Sarena replied to Amy. She explained that the defense is entitled to know whether Amy recovered lost wages during her recovery and, if so, from whom. Since Amy had received a PPP loan to cover lost wages, the defense would not be responsible for those lost wages because they were not truly lost. The defense would most likely have to subrogate, meaning reimburse Hometown Bank for the funds provided. Sarena also said she would forward Amy’s email to Aaron for further address, and she attached a copy of the FCE Report received on 08/16/2022, apologizing for the delay in sending it.\n\nEarlier still, at 11:08 AM, Amy had written expressing some frustration. She noted that it was good the PPP loan information had been obtained, but since she is no longer in business she would have to file bankruptcy because the bank’s determination used the 2019 tax year. She also indicated she had been able to obtain more PPP funds but was not sure if she would medically be able to be healed in time to continue. She stated she did not believe the PPP information should be entered into her case or presented to the defense. She complained that she had not received an updated report for the FCE or its findings, and she asserted that the defense appeared to be grasping for any possible means to avoid paying as much as possible. She referenced an MRI report indicating a current acute tear in her arm, but said doctors were not aligned to agree on treatment. She claimed medical malpractice due to an initial misdiagnosis in the ER, which she believed prolonged treatment, pain, and suffering. She wrote that this situation had been ongoing for almost four years, with days when she could not get out of bed and migraines so severe she felt as if she were dying, and that she mostly received medication with continued symptoms and no real remedy.\n\nAt 10:15 AM, Sarena sent another update to Amy. She stated that the FCE Report had been received and forwarded to the defense for their review. She noted that documents from Hometown Bank regarding Amy’s PPP loans were also under review. She acknowledged that Aaron had been in correspondence with the defense and that she would obtain a more detailed update from him.\n\nEarlier, at 10:10 AM, Amy had messaged asking for an update on progress, signing off with her name and a Franklin quotation: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” The exchange also included further repeated signature lines from Amy Mills with the same Benjamin Franklin quotation.\n\nThis sequence of communications reflects the ongoing handling of reported lost wages, PPP loan implications, potential subrogation to a bank, and concerns about medical issues, misdiagnosis, and malpractice in the context of the case.",

We requested records and bills from Ms. Mills' Norton providers as it was our understanding that she underwent an MRI at the end of May. None of those providers have any records for recent treatment for her. We are still waiting on her records and bills from Baptist Health Corbin. We will provide copies of those to you upon receipt. Please advise if there is any other recent medical treatment of Ms. Mills.\nFurther, you had previously advised of a FCE occurring in late July. Did this occur as planned? What are your thoughts on when you will be able to get us a demand?\nWe have also requested your client's tax returns for 2016, 2018 and 2020 several times. The lack of this information significantly limits our ability to evaluate her future earning impairment claim. We also need to know the last day that Bella Beauty was in business.\nIf you have any questions or would like to discuss the above in further detail, please do not hesitate to contact me.\nThank you,\nBetsy R.

The subject of the correspondence was the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank matter.\n\nIn Betsy Catron’s 10:10 a.m. email on August 22, 2022, she noted that she had requested records and bills from Ms. Mills’ Norton providers and understood that Ms. Mills underwent an MRI at the end of May; however, none of those Norton providers had any records of recent treatment. She stated they were still waiting on records and bills from Baptist Health Corbin and would provide copies upon receipt. She asked Aaron to advise if there was any other recent medical treatment of Ms. Mills. Betsy further inquired about the delayed late-July Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) and when they would be able to obtain a demand. She also mentioned that they had requested Ms. Mills’ tax returns for 2016, 2018 and 2020 several times, and that the lack of this information significantly limited their ability to evaluate her future earning impairment claim. Additionally, she asked for the last day Bella Beauty was in business and closed by inviting any questions or discussion, providing her contact details including her title as Attorney, the Vine Center address (333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507), telephone number (859.422.6000), fax number (859.422.6001), and the website (www.whtlaw.com).\n\nIn the later 12:29 p.m. email that same day, Aaron Whaley responded to Betsy, saying he would forward any records they might be missing. He confirmed that Amy had completed the FCE and that he had attached a copy. He added that he was in the process of conducting an economic analysis and thanked her.

Sedentary work is basically low level physical work that involves\nmostly sitting, some walking/standing on occasions and nothing that\nrequires lifting over 10lbs. The report acknowledges that while you are\nlimited in the work you do, you are able to perform jobs that are not\nphysical in nature, examples would be a desk job or running your business\n(handline paperwork) while employees actually perform the services.\n Aaron has set up an evaluation with an economist to help determine the\nfinancial impact these restrictions will have. Once we hear from the\neconomist, we will update you in further detail.\n However, we are still awaiting your tax documents from 2016 & 2017 as\nwell as the official date that Bella Beauty closed its doors. We understand\nthat your equipment and products are still in your location and you still\nhave possession of the location, however, we need the date of the last\nservices performed. We also understand your concern with providing all this\nfinancial information but as we explained it is required in order to\ndetermine the proper amount of compensation you should receive.\n If you do not have the tax documents in your possession, please reach\nout to the IRS and/or your tax preparer and obtain copies as soon as\npossible.

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Update communications were sent and exchanged in August 2022 between Amy Mills and attorney Sara(ena) M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding a work-capacity assessment and financial documentation, with the most recent update dated August 24, 2022.\n\nOn August 24, 2022 at 12:20 p.m. Eastern Time, Sara(ena) M. Tuttle wrote to Amy Mills with an update. In the body of the message, she explained that the FCE (functional capacity evaluation) report indicates Amy is able to perform sedentary work. She defined sedentary work as low-level physical work performed mostly while seated, with occasional walking or standing, and with no lifting over 10 pounds. The report also notes that, despite restrictions on the types of work Amy can perform, she is able to undertake jobs that are not physically demanding—examples given were desk-based employment or running her business (handling paperwork) while employees actually provide the required services. An economist has been arranged by Aaron to evaluate the financial impact of Amy’s restrictions, and a further update will be provided once the economist’s assessment is available.\n\nThe update also states that the firm is awaiting certain documents: Amy’s tax returns for 2016 and 2017, as well as the official date on which Bella Beauty ceased operations. The note acknowledges that Amy’s equipment and products remain at her location and she retains possession of the premises, but it requires the date of the last services performed. The message reiterates that while Amy may have concerns about providing financial information, the requested information is necessary to determine the proper amount of compensation she should receive. The firm advised that if Amy does not currently possess the tax documents, she should contact the IRS and/or her tax preparer to obtain copies as soon as possible. The message closes by inviting Amy to contact them with any questions. The email signature provides Sara(ena) M. Tuttle’s contact details and notes a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, along with the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext. 104.\n\nThe message thread shows an email sequence surrounding the same topic. Earlier on August 24, 2022 at 10:11 a.m., Amy Mills replied with a query: “What exactly does that report mean?” seeking clarification about the contents and implications of the FCE report.\n\nIn the same thread, on August 19, 2022 at 1:49 p.m., Amy Mills wrote that she understood she might have to file bankruptcy because she could not remain in business, and she mentioned that a bank representative indicated the paid electric bill could count toward a balance forgiven under the PPP. She remarked that she was unable to stay open and questioned the relevance of these items to her case.\n\nEarlier on August 19, 2022 at 11:36 a.m., Sarena Tuttle responded to Amy. She explained that the defense is entitled to know whether Amy recovered lost wages during her recovery and, since a PPP loan was received to cover lost wages, the defense would not be responsible for those “lost wages” if they were not actually lost (i.e., they were offset by the PPP funds). She indicated the defense would likely subrogate, meaning reimburse Hometown Bank for those funds. She said she would forward Amy’s email to Aaron for further addresses and attached a copy of the FCE Report received on August 16, 2022, apologizing for not sending it sooner.\n\nLater on August 19, 2022 at 11:08 a.m., Amy Mills replied with several concerns. She stated she was glad the PPP loan information had been obtained but that, since she was no longer in business, bankruptcy would be necessary because the bank’s calculations were based on the 2019 tax year; she noted that she had been able to obtain additional PPP funds but was unsure whether she would medically be able to continue. She stressed that the PPP information should not have been entered into her case. She also complained that she had not received an updated FCE report or its findings. Amy expressed frustration that the defense might be attempting to minimize payments and referenced an MRI report indicating a current acute tear in her arm, but that doctors were not aligned on treatment. She described ongoing medical issues, including four years of symptoms with days she cannot get out of bed and migraines, and she criticized the medical care she received as a result of misdiagnosis, arguing that this prolonged pain was caused by earlier errors. She claimed to be receiving only medication and continued symptoms without a satisfactory remedy.\n\nOn August 19, 2022 at 10:15 a.m., Sarena Tuttle replied that they had received the FCE Report and that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for review. She also stated that documents from Hometown Bank regarding Amy’s PPP loans were under review and that she would contact Aaron for a more detailed update.\n\nFinally, on August 19, 2022 at 10:10 a.m., Amy Mills asked for an update on the progress of the matter.\n\nThroughout these communications, the parties discussed the functional capacity assessment, the status and handling of PPP loan information, potential bankruptcy considerations, the need for tax documents from 2016 and 2017, the date Bella Beauty closed, and the ongoing medical issues, with requests for last services data and copies of tax documents to determine appropriate compensation. The correspondence included the Whaley Law Firm’s contact information, and the new email address for Saraena Tuttle.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. This update concerns communications between Amy Mills and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding the status of the case and associated documents.\n\nOn August 24, 2022, Amy Mills emailed Sarena Tuttle with the subject “Re: Update,” asking, “What exactly does that report mean?” This appeared to be a follow-up to the ongoing discussion about recent documents and their implications for the case.\n\nEarlier that week, the day before, on Friday, August 19, 2022 at 1:49 PM, Amy Mills wrote that she would have to file bankruptcy because she was unable to keep the business open. She also indicated that the bank determined the electric bill that had been paid would count toward the balance to be forgiven under the PPP. In her words, she noted: “Okay bc I will have to pay bk bc I was unable to stay open but the guy at the bank also said that the electric bill that was paid would also count toward that balance to be forgiven on the ppp.”\n\nAlso on August 19, 2022, at 11:36 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded. She explained that the defense is entitled to know whether Amy recovered lost wages during her recovery and, if so, from whom. Since Amy had received a PPP loan to cover lost wages, the defense would likely not be responsible for those “lost wages,” as they were not truly lost in light of the PPP funds. Sarena suggested that the defense may have to subrogate and reimburse Hometown Bank for the funds provided. She also stated that she would forward Amy’s email to Aaron for further address and appended a copy of the Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) Report received on August 16, 2022, noting an apology for the delayed sending.\n\nThat same day, at 11:08 AM, Amy Mills sent another message expressing concern: she was glad the PPP loan information had been obtained, but since she was no longer in business she would have to file bankruptcy based on the 2019 tax year. She indicated she had been able to obtain more PPP funds but was unsure whether she would medically be able to heal in time to continue. She asserted that none of this should impact the defense or be entered into her case. She also complained that she had not been given an updated FCE report or findings. She further described ongoing medical issues, including an MRI report showing a current acute tear in her arm, difficulties getting doctors aligned on treatment, and a belief that medical malpractice occurred due to misdiagnosis at the initial ER visit. She claimed the situation had persisted for almost four years, with ongoing days in bed, migraines, and only medication without a remedy, despite continued symptoms.\n\nEarlier on August 19, 2022, at 10:15 AM, Sarena replied that the firm had received the FCE Report and that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for their review. She also noted receipt of documents from Hometown Bank regarding Amy’s PPP loans, which were under review. She said Aaron had been in correspondence with the defense, but she did not have the details of those conversations and would contact him for a more detailed update.\n\nAt 10:10 AM on the same day, Amy had sent a brief message to Sarena asking for an update on progress: “Hey Sarena I was just wanting to get an update on where we r with the progress. Thank You, Amy Mills.” Her signature included a set of Benjamin Franklin quotations, culminating in the line: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” This quotation appears multiple times, reflecting her habitual closing, including variants and repetitions of the Franklin quotes.\n\nIn summary, the communications document ongoing efforts to interpret the FCE report, locate and review PPP loan documentation with Hometown Bank, and address broader concerns about bankruptcy, medical issues, alleged misdiagnosis and medical malpractice, and the potential impact of these items on the defense and the case. The team discussed potential subrogation to Hometown Bank, and Amy sought clarification on the meaning and implications of recent reports and updates, while also reaffirming her positions regarding the relevance of certain financial and medical documentation to the case.",

      "natural_language": "This case note, titled Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019 and pertaining to client Amy Mills, records a sequence of email exchanges in August 2022 between Amy Mills and Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding updates to a functional capacity evaluation (FCE), related financial issues, and the status of Amy’s business and potential claims. On August 25, 2022 at 14:29:36 Eastern Time, Amy wrote to Sarena to contest elements of a prior report. She stated that she had been bedridden for two days after that appointment and had messaged Aaron; she noted that the doctor had identified the dominant hand incorrectly, insisting she is left-hand dominant, not right-handed. She reported that the pain level at the time she left the appointment was an eight, and she did not see that reflected in the report. She said she could hardly stand or sit before leaving, and that nothing in the report accounted for her chronic migraines. She described being barely able to leave her home, unable to run her business, which she described as a teaching institute for which there was no one qualified to do the work other than herself, and she claimed the business is bankrupt. She expressed concern about how she could work when she could barely write her name and noted memory and head-injury-related issues, including getting things mixed up. She recalled having someone drive her to the appointment and characterized her life as one she had built with significant effort, including a master’s degree, as having been effectively taken from her. She criticized the suggestion of a desk job as disregarding her acute, debilitating migraines and suggested that others did not care because it was not their life to live.\n\nEarlier, on August 24, 2022 at 12:20 PM, Sarena replied to Amy with a summary of the FCE findings. She explained that the report concluded Amy is able to perform sedentary work—defined as low-level physical work requiring mostly sitting, with occasional walking or standing and no lifting over 10 pounds. The message stated that although Amy has work limitations, she can perform non-physical jobs such as a desk job or continuing to run her business (with others handling the services while she handles paperwork). Sarena noted that Aaron had arranged an evaluation with an economist to determine the financial impact of these restrictions, and that they would update Amy once the economist’s input was available. She added that they were awaiting tax documents from 2016 and 2017, as well as the official date Bella Beauty closed its doors. She acknowledged that Amy’s equipment and products remained at the location and that Amy still had possession of the site, but they needed the date of the last services performed. Sarena emphasized that financial information was required to determine the appropriate amount of compensation and urged Amy to contact the IRS or her tax preparer to obtain copies if she did not have the documents in her possession. The message concluded with Sarena’s signature and contact information for The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com with a note about the email address change).\n\nEarlier still, also on August 24, 2022, at 10:11 AM, Amy asked, “What exactly does that report mean?”\n\nOn August 19, 2022 at 1:49 PM, Amy stated that she would have to repay a debt because she was unable to stay open, and she referenced a bank representative who indicated that an electric bill paid would count toward PPP loan forgiveness. She suggested that she might file bankruptcy due to the financial situation, noting that the bank’s calculations used the 2019 tax year and that she had secured additional PPP funds, though she doubted whether she would be medically able to heal in time to continue operating.\n\nAt 11:36 AM on August 19, 2022, Sarena replied that the defense is entitled to know whether Amy recovered lost wages during her recovery, and if so, from whom. Since Amy had received a PPP loan to cover lost wages, Sarena understood that the defense would not be responsible for those lost wages and that subrogation—reimbursement of the funds provided by Hometown Bank—was likely. She said she would forward Amy’s email to Aaron for further address, and she attached a copy of the FCE Report received on August 16, 2022, apologizing for its tardy delivery.\n\nAt 11:08 AM on August 19, 2022, Amy expressed frustration, agreeing that the PPP loan information had been obtained but noting that she was no longer in business and would need to file bankruptcy, with the bank’s use of the 2019 tax year complicating matters. She mentioned obtaining additional PPP funds but doubted whether she could be medically healed in time to continue. She argued that the information should not have been entered into her case and that she still possessed an MRI report showing a current acute tear in her arm, though doctors were not aligned to provide treatment. She asserted that misdiagnosis at the initial ER treatment had prolonged pain and suffering and claimed medical malpractice. She described nearly four years of ongoing symptoms, days in bed, migraines so severe that she felt as though she were dying, and a lack of effective remedies beyond medication.\n\nAt 10:15 AM on August 19, 2022, Sarena advised that the FCE Report had been received and had been forwarded to the defense for review. She noted that the bank’s PPP loans were under review and that she would reach out to Aaron for a more detailed update.\n\nFinally, at 10:10 AM on August 19, 2022, Amy sent a request for an update on the progress.\n\nThroughout the thread, Amy’s signature blocks include repeated quotations of a Benjamin Franklin line—“The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart”—appearing multiple times in her messages.\n\nIn sum, the communications document ongoing concerns about the FCE’s interpretation of her ability to work, the implications for potential compensation, the status and financing of her past business (Bella Beauty), and the interplay between medical conditions (including chronic migraines and an acute arm tear) and potential legal or malpractice considerations, alongside PPP loan matters and tax documentation requirements. The firm’s communications also reference an economist evaluation, the possibility of subrogation for loan funds, and the need for updated medical and financial records to determine appropriate compensation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nIn a sequence of communications during August 2022, Amy Mills and The Whaley Law Firm, led by Sarena M. Tuttle, exchanged updates about her case. The thread begins with several messages from Amy Mills in mid-August and continues through August 25, with discussions centered on tax documents, the status of her business, medical issues, and the recent Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) and PPP loan matter.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, Amy Mills sent a message noting concerns about bankruptcy related to her inability to keep her business open, and she referenced information from a bank indicating that the electric bill paid would count toward PPP forgiveness. She also indicated she had obtained additional PPP funding but was unsure whether she would medically be able to continue. She expressed that she did not believe this information should be entered into her case, and she stated that she had not received an updated FCE or findings. She mentioned an MRI report indicating a current acute tear in her arm and difficulties in getting doctors to agree on treatment. She asserted ongoing issues for nearly four years, including days when she cannot get out of bed and migraines, with only medications and no remedy. She claimed to have a lingering impact from a head injury, memory difficulties, and the inability to obtain appropriate medical treatment; she criticized the lack of alignment among doctors and described the situation as ongoing pain and suffering.\n\nEarlier on August 19, 2022, at 10:15 AM, Sarena Tuttle had replied that the firm had received the FCE Report and that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for review. She also stated that documents from Hometown Bank regarding Mills’s PPP loans were under review and that she would obtain more detail from Aaron. She added that Mills’s case team would update her as more information became available and provided contact details for herself and the firm.\n\nAlso on August 19, 2022, at 11:08 AM, Mills responded with frustration about the PPP information and the status of her business. She reiterated that she was no longer in business and that the PPP loans were based on the 2019 tax year; she had been able to obtain additional PPP funds but was uncertain whether she would recover sufficiently to continue operating. Mills contended that the PPP information should not be entered into her case, and she criticized the lack of an updated FCE or findings. She emphasized that an MRI report showed a current acute tear in her arm and urged that medical malpractice be considered due to alleged misdiagnosis in the emergency department, which she believed prolonged pain and suffering. She argued that the ongoing situation had persisted for nearly four years, with days when she could not get out of bed and migraines, and stated that she was receiving only medications without effective treatment.\n\nOn August 19, 2022, at 10:15 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded that the firm had received the FCE Report and that Aaron had forwarded it to the defense for their review. She noted that they had also received documents from Hometown Bank concerning Mills’s PPP loans, which were under review, and that she would seek further details from Aaron. She indicated that she would provide a more detailed update once available.\n\nBy August 24, 2022, at 10:11 AM, Amy Mills asked directly, “What exactly does that report mean?” about the FCE. She was seeking clarification on the implications of the report’s findings.\n\nLater that same day, at 12:20 PM, Sarena Tuttle explained to Mills that the FCE report indicated she was able to perform sedentary work—defined as low-level physical work involving mostly sitting, with occasional walking or standing and no lifting over 10 pounds. The message clarified that, while Mills had work limitations, she could perform non-physical duties, such as a desk job or managing her business with employees performing services. The note also stated that Aaron had arranged an evaluation with an economist to determine the financial impact of these restrictions, and that once the economist’s input was received, they would provide a detailed update. It was also noted that the team was still awaiting Mills’s tax documents from 2016 and 2017, as well as the official date Bella Beauty closed its doors. The firm understood that Mills still possessed the equipment and products at her location and that the date of the last services performed was needed to complete the file. Tuttle emphasized that the financial information was required to determine the appropriate amount of compensation Mills should receive and urged Mills to obtain copies of any missing tax documents from the IRS or her tax preparer if they were not in her possession. The firm provided contact information for Sarena M. Tuttle, including the new email address, and the firm’s Louisville, Kentucky address and phone numbers.\n\nAlso on August 24, 2022, at 12:20 PM, Mills replied seeking further clarification about the report’s meaning, indicating a need for understanding of its implications for her case.\n\nOn August 25, 2022, at 2:29 PM, Mills sent a further update in which she reiterated that she had given all tax documents to the law office and speculated that they might have been lost in the basement, given prior case manager remarks about the previous manager not being thorough and her own willingness to locate the documents. She reaffirmed that the last date of relevant events was 2019, but she refused to provide a precise date and time because she could not be certain, stating she would not misrepresent or lie. She explained that she had been hurt and pursued the process hoping to recover, but she could not physically work, noting that she had built a business through hard work and would have continued if she could. She asserted that she had given her best effort on the associated test and that she had told the truth to the best of her memory. She claimed to depend on others for everything and argued that those others should be scrutinized for failing to act on their responsibilities, linking this to the way she was treated by her bank after the injury.\n\nAlso on August 25, 2022, the thread references a prior message from Mills in which she described the physical consequences and inaccuracies she perceived in medical reporting. She indicated that she had been bedridden for two days after a certain appointment, that the doctor had misidentified her dominant hand (she is left-hand dominant, not right-handed), and that her pain at the time of leaving the appointment was an 8 out of 10, a detail she did not see reflected in the report. She stated she could hardly stand or sit before leaving and that chronic migraines had not been accounted for. She described being barely able to leave her home, unable to run her business (which she characterized as a teaching institute with no one else qualified to operate it), and claimed the business was bankrupt. She questioned how she could work when she could barely write her name and mentioned memory problems, distortions from a head injury, and the need for someone to drive her to appointments. She emphasized her educational achievements, including a master's degree, and her longstanding effort to build a life that had been taken from her, noting that others asked her to perform a desk job without considering her migraines and general impact on life.\n\nThe communications also include the firm’s standard contact details for Sarena M. Tuttle at The Whaley Law Firm, including a Louisville, KY address, direct line, office line, and a new email address, to facilitate ongoing updates and inquiries. The thread also references Bella Beauty, Mills’s business, and the need to establish the date when its doors officially closed, as well as the status of Mills’s tax documents from 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn summary, the August 2022 correspondence focused on the implications of the FCE report (which indicated the ability to perform sedentary work), the status and availability of tax documents (2016 and 2017) and the date Bella Beauty closed, the handling and review of PPP loan information, and Mills’s ongoing medical concerns, including migraines, arm injury, head injury, and related treatment challenges. Throughout, Mills conveyed concern about accuracy in medical documentation, the impact of her injuries on her ability to work, and the financial and legal ramifications of the case.",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes an internal case communication about Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank. The file is labeled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019, and the client is Amy Mills. The correspondence involves Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville and Betsy R. Catron of WHT Law in Lexington, with Saraena Tuttle and a file-link email for Amy Mills cc’d, and the subject line references the Amy Mills matter against Forcht Bank.\n\nThe August 22, 2022 exchange lays out a detailed set of discovery and damages-related tasks. Betsy Catron wrote to Aaron Whaley in the morning, explaining that they had requested records and bills from Mills’s Norton providers because she reportedly underwent an MRI at the end of May. She reported that none of those Norton providers had any records for recent treatment and that they were awaiting records from Baptist Health Corbin, promising to provide copies upon receipt. Betsy also asked Aaron to advise if there was any other recent medical treatment of Mills. She inquired about a late July Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) and inquired about when they would be able to obtain a demand, noting their goal of having a demand at least two months before mediation and suggesting a possible December mediation if a demand could be produced by October 7. Betsy also requested Mills’s tax returns for 2016, 2018, and 2020, explaining that the lack of this information significantly limits their ability to evaluate Mills’s future earning impairment claim. Additionally, she asked for the last day Bella Beauty was in business. The email concluded with Betsy’s signature block, listing her title as Attorney and providing the Vine Center address at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, along with phone and fax numbers and the website.\n\nAaron’s reply that same day, August 22, 2022 at 12:30 PM, stated that he would forward any records they might be missing. He noted that Mills had completed the FCE and that he had attached a copy of it. He added that he was in the process of an economic analysis. The message was copied to Sarena Tuttle and included a file-link email address associated with Amy Mills Premise, and Aaron’s own signature block followed, including his Louisville address and contact details, as well as a caution line about external email attachments. A final line in Aaron’s signature appears garbled, reading “-- Aaron Whttps://www.google.com/maps/search/333uisville, KY 40222” along with the standard external-email caution.\n\nA month later, on September 21, 2022, Betsy sent another inquiry to Aaron: she asked when he would be able to provide a demand, noting that she would like it at least two months out from mediation and proposing that if a demand could be ready by October 7, they could set a December mediation, asking for his thoughts.\n\nAaron replied later that same day, September 21, 2022 at 10:03:40 AM, stating, “I am only waiting on economic report. Fingers crossed.” This indicated that the economic report was the outstanding item delaying a formal demand. The email chain shows the ongoing planning for mediation and the prerequisites (records, FCE, tax documents, and the economic analysis) being coordinated between the two firms, with the implicit goal of moving toward mediation in December pending the completion of the economic report and other documents.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank (Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019). Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn the matter of Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, communications between counsel progressed through late summer and fall of 2022. On August 22, 2022, Betsy Catron of WHT Law emailed Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm with several requests and updates. She reported that they had requested records and bills from Ms. Mills’s Norton providers, noting that Ms. Mills was understood to have undergone an MRI at the end of May; however, none of those Norton providers had records of recent treatment. They were still waiting on Ms. Mills’s records and bills from Baptist Health Corbin and would provide copies once received. Betsy asked for guidance on any other recent medical treatment Mrs. Mills might have had. She also inquired about a previously advised Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) that was to occur in late July and asked when a demand might be provided. Betsy further noted that they had requested tax returns for 2016, 2018, and 2020 several times, explaining that the absence of these documents significantly limited their ability to evaluate Ms. Mills’s potential earning impairment claim. She also asked for the last day Bella Beauty was in business and requested any information about additional recent medical treatment. Betsy concluded by inviting Aaron to contact her if there were questions or if she wished to discuss the matters further. The message was sent from Betsy to Aaron, and it did not include the lengthy signature block she later added in other messages.\n\nLater that same day, August 22, 2022 at 12:30 PM, Aaron Whaley responded, stating that he would forward any records they might be missing. He noted that Amy Mills had completed the FCE and attached a copy of it to his reply. He also said he was in the process of conducting an economic analysis.\n\nA little over a month later, on September 21, 2022, Betsy followed up again. In a message dated 9:19 AM, she asked when a demand could be expected, explaining their preference for the demand to be issued at least two months before mediation. She proposed that if a demand could be provided by October 7, they could schedule a December mediation, and she asked for Aaron’s thoughts on this timeline.\n\nAaron replied later that same day, September 21, 2022, at 10:04 AM, indicating that he was “only waiting on economic report” and that he was hopeful about the timeline (“Fingers crossed”).\n\nOn October 11, 2022, Betsy sent another follow-up, asking if Aaron knew when they could expect to receive a demand, expressing thanks in advance. That same day, Aaron responded at 11:55:59 AM, stating that he was waiting on the final report from the economist and that once that was complete, he would be able to prepare the demand, adding that it should be soon.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the correspondence circulated among Betsy Catron (Attorney at WHT Law), Aaron Whaley (Whaley Law Firm), and copies were distributed to the Amy Mills file (AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com) and Sarena Tuttle. The sequence reflects ongoing coordination around the timing of the demand and the status of medical and economic analyses in the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills — Premise, 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn January 2023, communications regarding Amy Mills continued between her and her attorney, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm. On January 13, 2023, Whaley forwarded an appointment-update email to Amy Mills Premise. The forwarded message included Amy’s reply, in which she reported that she had attended an orthopedic appointment the day before. The orthopedic specialist is scheduling six weeks of physical therapy, and if there is no improvement after that, another surgery may be required. Amy stated that she is in “terrible constant pain” and that she is in tears. She noted a scar tissue buildup, which she attributed to prolonged treatment, and she explained that the scar tissue results from both the severity of injuries to her head and neck and from the initial ER visit, where the ER report listed a muscle “strain,” but the tests performed that day showed injuries. She added a brief update on her current situation.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on January 10, 2023, Amy wrote to Aaron describing her condition in more detail. She said she had been down for about 15 days in the last month and a week due to migraines, requiring JP to help her almost all the time. She commented on issues tied to her marital status and being a single mother. She stated that her medical records document migraines described as “suicide migraines” resulting from a traumatic brain injury (TBI); with the head injury, the migraines are worse. She mentioned discussing her situation off the record with someone who handles disability cases and who indicated she would qualify for disability, asserting that the doctor and economist’ assessments were not given full consideration. She noted concerns about a nurse’s report from a visit, pointing out that the nurse is not a doctor, and that if necessary they could pursue a nurse’s report rather than a physician’s. She referenced that the nurse from the ER visit had told her she was fine, while her own report described she was vomiting and unable to have a conversation, resulting in a loss of days she could not account for. She contended that there had been malpractice in prolonging treatment because the ER report said she was fine, yet scans and radiology results showed injuries that should have informed the diagnosis. Her primary physician has stated multiple times that the ER visit contributed to prolonged treatment and complications, and Amy stated that she is “stuck with this for the rest of my life” and that it “should have never happened.” She claimed to have video showing a situation where it was raining and something was done again, noting there were no rugs or signs. She described the situation as clearly negligent “100 percent,” and mentioned “Bobby,” described as a lady from a band, who had told her that she and multiple others had fallen there and that those involved knew it was an issue. Amy stated that the incident could have been avoided and concluded with the assertion that it was criminal.\n\nOn January 9, 2023, Aaron Whaley replied: “Ok, thanks for letting me know. I will add that to your file. Let me know how it goes. Have you put any more thought into the demand?” Earlier that same day, at 3:14 PM, Amy Mills replied that she had an orthopedic appointment scheduled for Thursday in Lexington and signed off with a quote from Benjamin Franklin: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.”\n\nThe thread closes with Amy Mills’ contact details and her sign-off, which repeats the Franklin quote in her signature. The overall record documents ongoing medical concerns following head and neck injuries, ongoing pain and migraines, disability considerations, and disputes over medical treatment, ER reporting, and potential negligence.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn January 13, 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed Amy Mills with a Re: Appt update. He asked, “What Ortho did you see? I have sent your records to a medical reviewer to see what the best case from a medical standpoint we can make to say your migraines are the result of the fall. I should have that review back in the next two weeks.”\n\nAmy Mills replied later that day, describing the orthopedic appointment she had attended the previous day. She said she went to the orthopedic specialist and had been in severe pain all day, to the point of tears. The doctor reportedly scheduled six weeks of physical therapy, and if there was no change, another surgery would be required. She described terrible, constant pain that was not getting better and noted that the doctor said she had scar tissue buildup from prolonged treatment. She attributed the scar tissue to two factors: the severity of injuries to her head and neck, and her initial ER visit, where the report labeled the injury as a muscle “strain” even though the ER tests performed that day showed injuries.\n\nEarlier messages from Amy Mills provide additional context. On January 10, 2023 at 11:17 AM, she wrote at length about her condition. She had experienced approximately 15 days of migraines in the previous month and a week, during which she was largely unable to do anything. She mentioned that JP had to help her almost all the time. She described disputes about marital status affecting support, noting difficulties related to being a single mom as well. She referred to migraines she labeled as “suicide migraines” that stemmed from a traumatic brain injury (TBI); with the head injury, the migraines were especially disruptive, preventing her from working or engaging in other activities, as her head injury exerted control over every aspect of her life. She stated she had discussed her situation with someone off the record who evaluates disability cases and who had expressed that she would actually qualify for disability. She claimed that the assessments by a doctor and an economist had not been taken into account in her favor. She criticized the nurse report discussed in their talks, arguing that the nurse was not a doctor and suggesting they could rely on a nurse’s findings if necessary. She asserted that the nurse from that ER visit was the same ER nurse who had reported she was fine, while her own report described different symptoms. She described vomiting and an inability to have a conversation, noting that she had lost a lot of time—days—that she did not remember. She described medical malpractice for prolonging treatment because the ER report had said she was fine, while the scans and radiology reports on which a diagnosis should have been based showed injuries. Her primary physician allegedly stated multiple times that the ER visit had caused prolonged treatment and complications, and she warned that she was “stuck with this for the rest of [her] life.” She contended that the event should never have happened, and she claimed to have video showing it had occurred again during rain, with no rugs or signs. She stated that this was clearly negligent, “100 percent.” She added that “Bobby the lady from the band” stated that she, she and multiple people had fallen there; they knew it was an issue and that it could have been completely avoided. She concluded with the assertion that this was criminal.\n\nAlso on January 9, 2023, at 3:42 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to Amy, saying, “Ok, thanks for letting me know. I will add that to your file. Let me know how it goes. Have you put any more thought into the demand?”\n\nEarlier that same day, at 3:14 PM, Amy Mills wrote that she had an orthopedic appointment scheduled for Thursday in Lexington. She included the line, “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” attributed to Benjamin Franklin, followed by contact details for Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe correspondence concludes with the signatures of Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and Amy Mills, including the Franklin quote.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn February 2023, an appointment-update thread related to Amy Mills Premise was communications between Amy Mills and attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm. On February 10, 2023, Whaley forwarded the “Fwd: Appt update” message to Amy Mills Premise, attaching prior correspondence that began earlier in January 2023.\n\nIn Amy Mills’s message dated January 13, 2023 at 4:10 PM, she told Aaron Whaley that she had indicated in paperwork that he would have access to her medical records. She explained that she had gathered the paperwork for the appointment and reviewed the records from her March appointment. The blood work from that appointment showed a high white blood cell count, which usually signals an infection. She asked her doctor, JP, about this, and he recalled that it was a bad sinus infection and that she tends to get them every spring. She added that she does not remember a great deal, and she questioned the sequence of events surrounding a fall. She asserted that it seems impossible to have been knocked out cold—she described a knot in the left side of her head that remains sensitive, along with bruising she associates with blunt force trauma—that she could have bladder incontinence, vomiting, loss of space and time for days without memory, waking up unable to move, and wearing clothes that were wet from water on the floor, all without blunt head trauma. She noted that the foyer where the incident occurred is a small space with a bench. She said she spoke with JP about the ER visit and that the only thing in question was whether she hit her head on the floor or on the bench, and if she hit her head on the bench, whether she also hit her neck on the bench. She emphasized that she is not sure about these details “1,000 percent” because, as she said, it knocked her out or rendered her unconscious.\n\nEarlier, on January 13, 2023 at 3:49 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, asking what orthopedist Amy had seen. He also stated that he had sent her records to a medical reviewer to determine the best case from a medical standpoint to argue that her migraines are the result of the fall, and he expected to have that review back within about two weeks.\n\nIn another thread from January 13, 2023 at 3:41 PM, Amy Mills recounted that she had gone to an orthopedic appointment the previous day and was in significant pain, to the point of tears. The orthopedic doctor was scheduling six weeks of physical therapy and warned that if there were no improvement, another surgery might be required. She described ongoing severe pain and noted that the doctor said scar tissue had built up as a result of prolonged treatment. She attributed the scar tissue to the severity of head and neck injuries and to the initial ER visit, during which the report characterized the injuries as a muscle “strain,” even though the ER tests indicated injuries.\n\nOn January 10, 2023 at 11:17 AM, Amy Mills wrote again, describing that she had been down for about 15 days with migraines, to the point of being unable to do anything, with JP’s help almost constantly. She expressed frustration that she felt treated as though she were not a married person despite being a single mom. She stated that her medical records document what is labeled as “suicide migraines” linked to the traumatic brain injury (TBI), and that with the head injury the migraines are even worse. She had discussed with someone off the record about disability cases; that person had approved and denied disability cases and believed she would actually qualify as disabled, though the doctor and economist assessments had not been fully considered with respect to her head injury. She discussed concerns about a nurse’s report from a visit that suggested relying on a nurse instead of a physician, and noted that the nurse’s report came from the ER visit where she was told she was fine, which conflicted with her own report. She described vomiting, an inability to have a conversation, and significant memory gaps (“lost a lot of space and time”). She criticized what she called the malpractice of prolonged treatment, claiming the physician’s report said she was fine while the scans and radiology did indicate injuries that should have informed a diagnosis. She stated that her primary physician had repeatedly said that delaying treatment had caused prolonged treatment and complications, leaving her with lifelong issues. She asserted that this should never have happened and that she had video evidence of rain during the incident, no rugs, no signs, making the situation clearly negligent—“100 percent.” She mentioned that a woman named Bobby from a band had testified that many people had fallen there and that those involved knew there was an issue and that this could have been avoided, calling it criminal.\n\nOn January 9, 2023 at 3:42 PM, Aaron Whaley replied that he would add Amy’s information to her file and asked how the demand was progressing. He invited her to share any further thoughts about the demand.\n\nEarlier on January 9, 2023 at 3:14 PM, Amy Mills wrote that she had an orthopedic appointment scheduled for Thursday in Lexington.\n\nThe exchange closed with signatures that repeated the familiar phrases: “The heart of a fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of a wise man is in his heart.” — Benjamin Franklin. The thread also included standard contact information for Aaron Whaley and the Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-583-4022. The closing lines also reprinted Amy Mills’s name and the Franklin quote in a loop.",

The thread begins with an exchange between Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm. On February 13, 2023, Aaron replied to Sarena with a brief confirmation: “Looks good.” This reply followed Sarena’s message sent earlier that morning, in which she asked Aaron to review a package of materials she had attached and to let her know if anything was missed. In Sarena’s note, she stated that she had attached the Commonwealth IME and both addendums, the FCE report, and the Voc/Eco Report and Supplement Letter, and she requested a thorough review.\n\nThe history of the drafting process began on February 3, 2023, when Sarena sent what she described as the rough draft of Mills Expert Disclosures. She noted that the Nazar section was complete and the phy section had already been templated, while the Voc/Eco section had a generic rough outline provided but still needed Aaron’s “silver language” added.\n\nPrior to that, on February 10, 2023, Aaron sent a directive regarding how disclosures should address Linda Jones. His instruction was to list all documents sent to Linda Jones under the B section, ensure that both experts’ reports were included, provide a generic entry for “all medical providers,” and specifically name Dr. Cyna Khalily.\n\nThe emails include standard correspondence formatting and signatures from both attorneys. Sarena’s signature lists The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line and office numbers, and a note indicating a new email address. Aaron’s correspondence is shown with his contact details at The Whaley Law Firm. The initial message announcing the high-priority disclosures was sent in the subject line: Re: High Priority Mills Expert Disclosures - Due 02/11/2023, and the message chain included a cc to Amy Mills Premise via a Louisvillle accident law firm filevine app address.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nRe: Your Personal Injury Claim - New Request for Information\n\nThe record begins with an email thread concerning Amy Mills’s personal injury claim and a new request for information. On April 28, 2023, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with contact numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104 and email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new address), sent Amy Mills a message following receipt of a request from the Defense Attorney for Forcht Bank. The message asked Amy to review the attached document and provide information related to her applications for employment or participation in a practicum or internship program as a counselor or Counselor Associate, and invited her to contact them with any questions.\n\nOn April 29, 2023, Amy Mills replied. She stated that the request concerns her transcripts, which show coursework and grades, and a copy of the diploma received as a result of completing these requirements. She asked whether this documentation was substantial enough for the defense’s needs.\n\nThe following day, April 30? or April 29? The timeline shows April 29 as the day of Amy’s message; on May 1, 2023, Sarena responded again. In her May 1 message, Sarena explained that Amy’s response referenced classes, grades, and diplomas, but the defense’s request is for employment verification information—specifically, places where Amy has applied, worked, or volunteered using the new skills referenced in the request.\n\nFinally, on May 3, 2023, Amy Mills sent a reply clarifying her understanding and next steps. She wrote that she is unsure what “new skills” refers to. She indicated she would gather what she can for the request as soon as possible, but noted that her belongings are in storage and she would need help due to physical limitations. She acknowledged that the course-required internship curriculum, as part of the requirements to obtain the diplomas, is among the requested items. She also asked for clarification on the time frame for the requested documents (e.g., 5, 10, or 15 years) and signed her name, “Amy Mills.”",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nBetween April 28 and May 3, 2023, a series of emails concerning a new request for information in Amy Mills’s personal injury claim were exchanged. The correspondence was initiated by Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, acting as a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, and circulated to Amy Mills and several recipients related to the case.\n\nOn April 28, 2023, at 10:41 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent an email to Amy Mills and others noting that the defense attorney for Forcht Bank had attached a request. She asked Amy to review that document and provide any information related to Amy’s applications for employment or participation in a practicum or internship program as a counselor or Counselor Associate. If Amy could not provide documentation, Sarena asked for a list of any places where Amy had provided services, with dates and any compensation received.\n\nThe following day, April 29, 2023, at approximately 1:30 PM, Amy Mills replied. She stated that the defense has her transcripts showing the coursework and grades completed at college, along with a copy of the diploma received upon completing those requirements. She asked whether this documentation might be substantial enough to satisfy the request.\n\nOn May 1, 2023, at 9:30 AM, Sarena Tuttle responded to Amy’s message. She clarified that the request was for employment verification information—specifically, places where Amy had applied, worked, or volunteered using the newly acquired skills. She emphasized that the request was not limited to classes, grades, or diplomas.\n\nAmy Mills sent another reply on May 3, 2023, at about 9:17 AM. She expressed uncertainty about the meaning of the term “new skills.” She said she would assemble what she could, but noted that items were in storage and that her physical capabilities would make gathering materials difficult. She reiterated that the requested items included the course-required curriculum for internship per the course requirements needed to obtain the diploma, and she asked about the time frame for the requested documents (whether it covered 5, 10, or 15 years).\n\nLater on May 3, 2023, at 10:20 AM, Sarena Tuttle sent a final clarification. She stated that there is no time frame. She asked Amy to provide any and all documents related to any and all employment (including internships and volunteer work) under the fields of substance abuse, behavioral health, or mental health counseling. She advised that, even if documentation is not available, Amy should provide a list of every place where she provided services, with dates and the amount of any compensation, if applicable. The email included Sarena’s contact information and noted a new email address for correspondence.\n\nSignature details for Sarena M. Tuttle appeared at the end of the May 3, 2023 message, identifying her roles as Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager with The Whaley Law Firm, along with the firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), direct line (502-357-9971), office line (502-583-4022 ext 104), and the email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, accompanied by a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise 04-26-2019. This narrative records the communications concerning Amy Mills’ personal injury claim and a new information request issued in May 2023 by The Whaley Law Firm, specifically by Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, to Amy Mills. The message thread begins with an email dated May 3, 2023 at 11:50 a.m. from Sarena Tuttle to Amy Mills (and to the broader distribution list including Celia’s former contacts). In that note, Sarena explains she is confused because Amy had said she would attach information, but the only attachments were two screenshots of emails with Celia. Sarena notes that Celia is no longer with the firm and she is not privy to any conversations Amy had with Celia, so she will only accept documents as they are needed and cannot find where the information was saved in Amy’s file. Sarena points out that in Amy’s deposition, Amy stated she had training and education in substance abuse, behavioral, and/or mental health counseling, which is what the “new skills” reference means — that the new skills are counselor work rather than beautician/cosmetologist work. Sarena asks Amy to send the requested information as soon as possible, acknowledging it may take a day or two to gather everything. She instructs Amy to begin with a list or resume of any counseling-related work she has done, including dates and the method and amount of compensation. She clarifies that educational materials are not needed; what is required is information about who Amy has worked for, volunteered for, or completed internships with. The message ends with Sarena’s contact details and a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nThe email thread continues with a reply from Amy Mills dated May 3, 2023 at 11:29 a.m. in which she expresses remaining confusion about what “new skills” refers to. She explains difficulties in assembling documents because items have been requested multiple times and some materials have been lost or misplaced during changes in who is handling the file. Amy states she found an email she intends to attach that contains daily notes of her work at the Trillium Center, an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults, including details about her supervisor, the supervisor’s CV/resume, copies of licensure, scheduled sessions, and activities, among other information related to the requests and prior merit discussions. She notes that whenever she finds documents that may or may not be needed, she has forwarded them to the law office because of memory issues related to a traumatic brain injury/nerve damage from injuries in this case. She emphasizes that she is reviewing saved and sent emails to gather the required information and acknowledges that this material corresponds to one month of what had been required for two years of her master’s curriculum. She indicates she will forward this exact email separately as an attachment and closes with thanks and her name, Amy Mills.\n\nEarlier on the same day, at 10:20 a.m., Sarena Tuttle had written to Amy with a more directive request: there is no defined time frame, and Amy should provide any and all documents related to any and all employment (including internships and volunteering) under the category of substance abuse, behavioral, or mental health counseling. If documentation does not exist, Amy should provide a list of all places where she provided services, with dates and any compensation details. Sarena provides her standard contact information and reiterates the lack of a time frame.\n\nEarlier still, at 9:17 a.m. on May 3, 2023, Amy Mills replied that she did not understand what “new skills” meant. She said she would assemble what she could as soon as possible, though items are in storage and gathering them is hindered by physical limitations. She noted that the course’s required internship curriculum to obtain the diploma was among the items requested and asked about the time frame (e.g., 5, 10, 15 years) for the documents.\n\nOn May 1, 2023 at 9:30 a.m., Sarena responded that there is no time frame and reiterated that the request is for employment verification information. She asked Amy to identify places where she has applied, worked, or volunteered using the new skills, and to provide details even if documentation is not available.\n\nThe thread also includes prior correspondence from April 28 and April 29, 2023. On April 28, Sarena informed Amy that the office had received a request from the Defense Attorney for Forcht Bank and asked Amy to review the document and provide information related to her applications for employment or participation in a practicum or internship program as a counselor or Counselor Associate, inviting any questions. On April 29, 2023 at 1:30 p.m., Amy stated that the transcripts already show the course work and grades, and a copy of the diploma, and asked whether that documentation is insufficient.\n\nAmy had previously written on April 29, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. that the transcripts from college prove she completed the coursework with grades and that a diploma was received as a result of completing these requirements, and she questioned whether this material was substantial enough.\n\nThe correspondence overall centers on obtaining documentation of Amy Mills’ counseling-related employment or practice experiences, including internships and volunteer work, tied to her related skills claimed in the deposition, in support of her personal injury claim. The communications reflect the firm’s need to obtain employment verification or equivalent documentation—past, present, and, if applicable, within the past several years—about where Amy worked, volunteered, or interned in substance abuse, behavioral, or mental health counseling, the absence or presence of compensation, and dates of service. The dialogue also reveals Amy’s difficulties with document retrieval and storage, her use of prior emails as sources of information due to memory concerns arising from a traumatic brain injury, and her ongoing effort to forward relevant materials to the law office.\n\nSignature blocks in the messages identify Sarena M. Tuttle as the sender of the Whaley Law Firm communications, with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104; and email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The correspondence also notes a “Please note new email address” reference in Sarena’s signature. The email chain includes references to Celia (a former firm member) and indicates that Celia’s conversations are not accessible to Sarena. The May 3, 2023 date line is shown in the header of the initial note (11:50 a.m.) as well as subsequent replies within the same day, and earlier messages span from April 28 to April 29, 2023.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. This narrative summarizes the email thread regarding a new request for information tied to Amy Mills’s personal injury claim, with communications between Amy Mills and Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm dated April 28, 2023 through May 3, 2023.\n\nOn April 28, 2023 at 10:41 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, wrote to Amy Mills. She noted that the defense attorney for Forcht Bank had attached a new request and asked Amy to review the document and provide information related to her applications for employment or participation in a practicum or internship program as a counselor or Counselor Associate. She also requested that, if documentation was unavailable, Amy provide a list of places where she provided services, with dates and any compensation, if applicable. Sarena’s signature included the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct and office phone numbers and her new email address.\n\nThe following day, April 29, 2023 at 1:30 PM, Amy Mills responded. She stated that the documents include transcripts showing course work and grades, and mentioned having a copy of something accessible via a link that appears to reference completing the requirements (the text includes a garbled portion: “copy of thttps://www.google.com/maps/search/712pleating these requirements”). She asked whether this material was substantial enough to satisfy the request.\n\nOn May 1, 2023 at 9:30 AM, Sarena replied again, explaining that the request is for employment verification information—specifically, places where Amy has applied, worked, or volunteered using the new skills. She instructed Amy to provide information about employment or practicum/internship involvement in counseling, including any places where such work occurred, and to include dates and any compensation.\n\nOn May 3, 2023 at 9:17 AM, Amy sent another message. She indicated she did not understand what “new skills” referred to and that she would assemble what she could as soon as possible, noting that items are in storage and she would need assistance due to physical limitations. She added that the requested items include the course-required internship curriculum in order to obtain diplomas and asked what time frame was required for the documents (e.g., 5, 10, or 15 years).\n\nLater on May 3, 2023 at 10:20 AM, Sarena replied that there was no specified time frame. She reiterated the need for any and all documents related to employment, internships, or volunteer work under the realms of substance abuse, behavioral, or mental health counseling. She requested that, even in the absence of documentation, Amy provide a list of all places where she provided services, with dates and any compensation.\n\nThat same day, May 3, 2023 at 11:28 AM, Amy responded with thanks and further context. She stated she was still unclear about what “new skills” referred to. She described going through emails to gather documentation and noted a separate issue: documentation requested multiple times had been lost or misplaced during transfers. She reported finding an email documenting daily notes of work at the Trillium Center, described as an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults. She noted the presence of her supervisor, her supervisor’s CV/Resume, copies of licensure, scheduled sessions and activities, and other information related to this request and past discussions of merit. Amy explained that whenever she encountered documents that may be relevant, she forwarded them to the law office, due to memory difficulties stemming from a traumatic brain injury and nerve damage, depending on the doctor’s assessment. She emphasized that she is attempting to assemble saved and sent emails to gather the requested information and pointed out that one month of the work documented in this material also related to two years of her master’s curriculum, tying back to her initial email indicating the content had already been sent previously. She said she would forward this exact email separately as an attachment and closed with thanks. Her message included the line “(See attachment).”\n\nIn sum, the thread shows a back-and-forth in which the firm requested comprehensive employment-related documentation tied to counseling and related services, while Amy sought to clarify the scope and time frame, explained challenges with access to stored documents and memory, and attempted to gather and forward relevant materials, including materials from her experience at the Trillium Center and items related to her master’s curriculum. The emails include multiple signatures, with Sarena M. Tuttle’s contact details at The Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; E: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as the new email address).",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes a May 3, 2023 email exchange in the personal injury matter for Amy Mills, client of the case labeled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019.\n\nThe thread began with an email from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, dated Wednesday, May 3, 2023 at 1:06 PM EDT. The message was sent from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com to Amy Mills at bellabeautyinstitute@gmail.com, with copies to agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com (Aaron Whaley) and to Amy Mills Premise file address AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, as well as to Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019. In the body of the email, Sarena apologized for the frustration and stated that all she needed at that time was a list of Amy’s jobs that fall under the counseling/social worker umbrella, whether internships or paid employment. She noted that she had reviewed the file and Aaron had reviewed the emails to Celia, and she requested simply a list of any and all jobs in that umbrella.\n\nLater that day, at 12:44 PM (times indicated as approximate in the thread), Amy Mills replied with considerable frustration. She said she had sent everything she had multiple times and that emails she had sent were forwarded to the firm’s current case manager, but she questioned whether the documentation had been forwarded at all due to multiple changes in case managers. She asked for clarification on whether the information would be accepted and filed in her file for present or possible future use. Amy suggested that the confusion likely originated from the mixing of roles—cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist—along with training and education, or all of the above. She asserted that the email screenshots she had sent served as proof of time/date stamps, even before any deposit, and that she was attempting to locate saved emails to re-forward the information. She explained she had no control over how her information was stored or transferred within the law firm but emphasized her transparency and willingness to provide any and all information. She also referenced prior discussions with Aaron about discovery/disclosure and stated that she sent everything because she did not know what might be important or pertinent to the case, arguing that without sending everything, Aaron could not be fully aware of what to request. Amy gave an example of a confusing point in the prior correspondence: a statement that “we do not need educational material,” which, in her view, contradicted the internship material she believed to be relevant. She speculated about what practical and clinical applications were required in her educational studies to obtain degrees and certifications on file and acknowledged that gathering the requested information would take time. She closed by hoping the message clarified things.\n\nA follow-up reply from Sarena was sent on the same day at 11:51 AM. She expressed that she was a bit confused and noted that Amy had said she was attaching information, but the only attachments were two screenshots of emails with Celia. Sarena explained that Celia was no longer with the firm and that she was not privy to the contents or context of any conversations Amy had with Celia. She stated she would only accept requested documents as they were needed and did not see where the information had been saved in Amy’s file. Sarena reminded Amy that in Amy’s deposition she had stated receiving training, education, etc., in substance abuse, behavioral and/or mental health counseling, and that “new skills” referred to Amy’s skills as a counselor rather than as a beautician/cosmetologist. She requested that Amy send the requested information as soon as possible and suggested starting with a list/resume of any counseling-related work, including dates and the method or amount of compensation. Sarena emphasized that educational material was not needed and reiterated the need to know who Amy had worked for, volunteered for, or completed internships with. The message carried Sarena’s signature with contact details for The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nAt 11:29 AM on May 3, Amy Mills replied again. She indicated she was not sure what “new skills” meant and described the process of combing through emails to save electronic documentation, noting that documentation was being requested multiple times and had been lost or misplaced during staff transitions. She mentioned a specific email containing daily notes of work at the Trillium Center, an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults, which included her supervisor, the supervisor’s CV/resume, copies of licensure, scheduled sessions and activities, and other information relevant to the requests and discussions of merit. Amy stated that whenever she found documents that might be needed—even if they might not be—they had been forwarded to the law office due to her difficulty recalling details caused by a traumatic brain injury and nerve damage related to injuries in the case. She explained that the materials she found represented one month of a two-year master’s curriculum and again stated her intention to forward the exact email in attachments. She closed by thanking the recipient.\n\nEarlier in the day, at 10:20 AM, Sarena replied again to Amy, reiterating that there was no defined time frame and instructing Amy to provide any and all documents related to employment (internships, volunteering, etc.) under the domains of substance abuse, behavioral or mental health counseling. She also advised that even if Amy did not have documentation, she should provide a list of all places where services were provided, with dates and any compensation, if applicable, and again reminded Amy to use the format of a list rather than educational material.\n\nAt 9:17 AM, Amy Mills had replied to the chain asking for clarification about what “new skills” referred to. She stated she would gather the necessary information as soon as possible, noting that the requested materials were in storage and that she would need assistance due to physical limitations. She explained that the requested items included the course-required curriculum of internships necessary to obtain diplomas and asked about the time frame for the documents (for example, whether 5, 10, or 15 years' worth of materials were being sought). The thread ends with a truncated line from a May 1, 2023 message, reading “On Mon, May 1, 2023 at 9:,” indicating an earlier correspondence before the May 3 exchanges.\n\nThroughout this exchange, the communications repeatedly reference the underlying case management context at The Whaley Law Firm, the evolving list of case managers (including changes in who handles Amy’s file), and the ongoing effort to obtain a precise, comprehensive timeline of Amy Mills’s related counseling and related work experience—whether paid, volunteer, or internship—under the broad umbrella of counseling and mental health services, while navigating questions about what constitutes “educational material” versus practical work experience. The thread also highlights Amy’s perception of administrative fragmentation (switching case managers and incomplete forwarding of documents) and her efforts to supply documentation tied to her training, licensure, and practical work at relevant facilities, including the Trillium Center, in the face of health-related limitations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: Your Personal Injury Claim - New Request for Information. From: Amy Mills to Sarena Tuttle. Date: May 3, 2023, 12:44:32 PM Eastern Time.\n\nChronology of the email exchange:\n\nOn April 29, 2023 at 1:30 PM, Amy Mills emailed to address the new information request related to her personal injury claim. She stated that the law firm already has her transcripts showing coursework and the diploma, and she referenced the materials tied to the request, noting that her transcripts and course work are on file with the college. She indicated that the requested items include documentation from a two-year master’s curriculum and the related diploma, and she suggested that the documentation had already been provided but that it was now being requested again.\n\nOn May 1, 2023 at 9:30 AM, Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, replied that there is no “time frame” for the request and that the firm is seeking employment verification information related to the “new skills” referenced in Amy’s deposition. She explained that the firm needs information about places where Amy has applied, worked, or volunteered using those new skills, rather than educational materials, and she asked Amy to provide a list or resume of any counseling-related work with dates and compensation details, if any. She reiterated the firm’s contact details and noted that Celia, who previously handled the matter, is no longer with the firm and that Sarena was not privy to any prior conversations with Celia.\n\nOn May 3, 2023 at 9:17 AM, Amy Mills replied that she was still unclear about what “new skills” referred to. She said she would gather what she could, acknowledging that items are in storage and that her physical capabilities create a need for assistance. She indicated that the requested items include the course-required internship curriculum necessary to obtain her diplomas and asked what time frame was requested for these documents.\n\nOn May 3, 2023 at 10:20 AM, Sarena responded, clarifying again that there is no fixed time frame and restating the scope of the request: Amy should provide any and all documents related to employment (including internships, volunteering) under the areas of substance abuse, behavioral health, or mental health counseling. If documentation is not available, Amy should provide a list of places where she provided services, with dates and any compensation.\n\nOn May 3, 2023 at 11:29 AM, Amy Mills replied with further details. She thanked Sarena for the reply and admitted continued confusion about the meaning of “new skills.” Amy explained that while she searches through accessible emails to gather documents, she found an email containing daily notes from her work at the Trillium Center (an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults), including her supervisor, her supervisor’s CV/resume, copies of licensure, scheduled sessions and activities, and other information relevant to prior discussions of merit. She stated that she has forwarded any documents she could locate because she cannot always recall everything, especially given a traumatic brain injury and nerve damage resulting from the injuries in her case. Amy noted that this effort reflects only one month of what the master’s program required over two years and that she would forward this exact email as an attachment separately. She emphasized her intention to continue gathering and forwarding pertinent documents as requested.\n\nOn May 3, 2023 at 11:51 AM, Sarena responded with some confusion and clarification: Amy had stated she was attaching information, but the only attachments were two screenshots of emails with Celia. Sarena reminded that Celia is no longer with the firm and she is not privy to those conversations. She reiterated that she would only accept requested documents as needed and did not see any of this information saved to Amy’s file. Sarena then referenced Amy’s deposition, noting that Amy had testified to receiving training, education, etc., in substance abuse, behavioral and/or mental health counseling, which is what “new skills” referred to. Sarena clarified that Amy’s counseling work, not beautician/cosmetologist work, is the focus. She urged Amy to send the requested information as soon as possible, starting with a list or resume of any counseling-related work she had performed, including dates and the method or amount of compensation. Sarena again stated that educational materials were not required, and she repeated that they needed to know who Amy had worked for, volunteered for, and with whom she completed internships. She closed with the law firm’s contact information and noted the new email address for Sarena.\n\nFinally, on May 3, 2023 at 12:44 PM, Amy Mills sent a closing communication continuing her frustration and detailing several procedural concerns. She stated that she had sent everything multiple times and that the emails she sent were forwarded to the firm’s case manager at (@wlf) because the case had changed case managers several times, yet the documentation had not been forwarded. She asked for confirmation of whether her understanding was correct. Amy described the situation as extremely difficult given the amount of time that has passed and the circumstances directly related to the case. She argued that emails requesting documentation should be filed in her file for present or future use and suggested that the confusion around the mix of roles—cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist—along with training and education, likely contributed to the misfiling. Amy referenced the email screen shots as proof that she had sent the information repeatedly, noting time/date stamps already captured in those screen shots even before the deposit occurred. She indicated she was attempting to locate any saved documents to re-forward and reiterated that she has little control over how her information is stored or transferred within the law firm. She stated continued transparency about all information. Amy noted that she had previously discussed discovery/disclosure with Aaron, explaining that she sends everything because she does not know what might be important or requested; failing to do so would leave him unaware of what to request. She provided an example: a perceived contradiction in a prior email claiming “we do not need educational material,” while internship material appeared to be exactly that. She speculated on possible reasons for the confusion—what practical and clinical applications were required in her education to obtain degrees and certifications—admitting it would take time to gather the necessary items. She concluded by hoping her clarification helps.\n\nThese exchanges collectively document Amy Mills’s attempt to provide information for her personal injury claim, the firm’s attempts to constrain the scope of the requested information to counseling-related employment (as opposed to general educational materials), and Amy’s ongoing effort to reconcile different interpretations of what constitutes “new skills” and what documents are required, along with ongoing concerns about record-keeping, case-management changes, and the accessibility of her materials.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills, Premise - 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: Your Personal Injury Claim – New Request for Information.\n\nOn May 3, 2023, The Whaley Law Firm sent a new information request to Amy Mills regarding her personal injury claim. The message came from Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222. Her direct lines were D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and her email was Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, noted as a new address. The email also copied Aaron Whaley and a case-specific email alias for Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, and stated the recipient addresses included bellabeautyinstitute@gmail.com and Amy Mills.\n\nThe content began with an acknowledgment of thanks and an apology for prior frustration and confusion. The firm signaled that the request was a continuation of their efforts to obtain information pertinent to Amy Mills’ personal injury claim.\n\nEarlier in the day, Amy Mills replied that she would compile a list of items and then allow Sarena to review them, indicating she would determine if anything needed modification or addition before proceeding.\n\nPrior to that, at 10:20 a.m., Sarena had written that there was no fixed time frame and explicitly requested documentation relating to any and all employment under the counseling, behavioral health, or mental health counseling umbrella—whether internships or paid positions. She advised Amy to provide documentation for any and all places where she provided services, with dates and compensation details if any, and to supply a list if documentation was not available.\n\nAt 11:29 a.m., Amy asked for clarification about the term “new skills,” expressing uncertainty about what that phrase referred to in the context of the request.\n\nShortly afterward, at 11:51 a.m., Sarena responded with some confusion of her own, noting that Amy had said she would attach information, but only two screenshots of emails with someone named Celia had been received. Sarena explained that Celia was no longer with the firm and that the team would only accept documents as needed; she referenced Amy’s deposition, which indicated training and education in substance abuse, behavioral, and/or mental health counseling, clarifying that “new skills” referred to Amy’s counseling work rather than cosmetology. Sarena urged Amy to send the requested information promptly, starting with a resume or list of counseling-related work, including dates and compensation, and stated that they did not need educational material but did need information on employers, volunteer work, and internships.\n\nAt 12:44 p.m., Amy again expressed frustration, stating she had sent everything multiple times and that her documentation had been forwarded to a different part of the firm due to multiple changes in case managers, but the documentation had not followed along. She described ongoing difficulty with the case filing and what seemed to be a mix-up among roles (cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist) and training/education. Amy asserted she was attempting to locate saved emails with documents to re-forward and noted she had limited control over how her information was stored or transferred within the firm. She emphasized that she had been transparent and forthcoming and referenced discussions about discovery and disclosure, explaining that she was sending everything because she did not know what would be deemed important or pertinent to the case. Amy suggested the “new skills” issue might relate to the practical and clinical applications required in her educational programs, and she indicated gathering time would be needed to compile relevant material, including internship material, which could be time-consuming.\n\nAt 1:06 p.m., Sarena reaffirmed the request, explaining that there was no stated time frame and reiterating the need for any and all documents related to employment in counseling/behavioral or mental health counseling, including internships and positions. She advised that if documentation was unavailable, Amy should still provide a list of places where she provided services, with dates and compensation details if applicable.\n\nAround 2:35 p.m., Amy responded that she would compile a list and send something for review, and that Sarena could indicate whether any items needed to be changed or added, with the understanding that they could proceed from there.\n\nFinally, at 3:11 p.m., Sarena closed the thread with a courteous note: “Awesome, thank you so much. Again, I apologize for the frustration and confusion.” The message included Sarena’s full signature, reiterating her role and contact information, and noting the new email address.\n\nThroughout the thread, Amy’s inbox referenced a note about daily logs from her time at the Trillium Center (an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults), including a supervisor, supervisor’s CV/resume, licensure copies, scheduled sessions, and related activities—items she described as pertaining to past discussions of merit. Amy attributed her difficulty in gathering and forwarding documents to the TBI/nerve damage resulting from injuries in her case and to the firm’s changing personnel, which she felt had led to lost or misfiled documentation. She also highlighted a broader issue that the information she sent before had been directed to the wrong place or person within the firm’s file system, leading to several misunderstandings about what material was being requested and what was considered “new skills.”\n\nThis exchange illustrates an ongoing process to collect employment-related documentation tied to Amy Mills’ counseling and mental health-related work for purposes related to her personal injury claim, including internships and volunteer work, with an emphasis on concrete details (employers, supervisors, dates, and compensation) rather than solely on educational materials. The firm remained focused on obtaining a comprehensive list and supporting documentation, while Amy continued to navigate internal firm changes and the effects of a traumatic brain injury on her ability to recall and assemble the requested records.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise Incident Case Note dated 04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nOn May 3, 2023, Amy Mills, the client in a personal injury claim, initiated contact with Sarena M. Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding a new information request. In her first note, sent in the afternoon, Amy said she would compile a list of items, send them for review, and then ask whether anything needed to be changed or added before proceeding.\n\nEarlier that same day, at about 1:06 p.m., Sarena responded with a focused request. She asked Amy to provide a comprehensive list of all jobs that fall under the counseling or social worker umbrella, including internships and paid positions. Sarena explained that both she and Aaron had reviewed the file and related emails, and she asked that Amy simply send a complete list of all counseling/social work roles she had held, regardless of whether they were volunteer, internship, or paid work. Sarena provided her contact details for The Whaley Law Firm and noted Amy’s new email address.\n\nEarlier still, at roughly 12:44 p.m., Amy replied with visible frustration. She explained that she had already sent the requested information multiple times and that emails had been forwarded to the firm’s current case manager (the case had been reassigned several times within the firm). Amy expressed confusion over what would be accepted as responsive documentation and asserted that there had been mixups between descriptors such as cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist, including training and education. She claimed to have sent information before the deposit and to have screenshots documenting time and dates as proof. She also noted she was trying to locate other saved emails with documents to re-forward, and she described her lack of control over how information was stored or transferred within the firm. Amy emphasized her transparency and her practice of sending everything to ensure that the team could identify what might be important for discovery or disclosure, including concerns about what material might matter for the case.\n\nEarlier in the day, at about 11:29 a.m., Amy had written to say she would send what she could, noting the ongoing confusion about what constitutes “new skills” and asking to gather documentation from storage. She mentioned an email containing daily notes from work at the Trillium Center, an inpatient and outpatient facility for adolescents and adults, including her supervisor, her supervisor’s CV/Resume, copies of licensure, scheduled sessions, and activities relevant to the request. She described having forwarded any potentially relevant documents to the law office in case they were needed later, citing her traumatic brain injury (TBI) and nerve damage as factors affecting her memory and recall. She indicated she would forward the exact email separately with attachments and thanked the recipient.\n\nAt about 11:51 a.m., Sarena replied with some confusion of her own. She noted that the only attachments present were two screenshots of Amy’s emails with a person named Celia. Sarena stated that Celia was no longer with the firm and that she was not privy to the contents or context of conversations with Celia. She explained that she would only accept documents as they were needed and reiterated that the firm might not have those materials saved in Amy’s file. Sarena referenced Amy’s deposition, stating that Amy had testified to receiving training and education in substance abuse, behavioral and/or mental health counseling, and clarified that “new skills” referred to these counseling-related capabilities rather than cosmetology. She urged Amy to send the requested information promptly and suggested starting with a list or resume of any counseling-related work, including dates and compensation, noting that educational material was not required, only information about employers, volunteering, and internships.\n\nEarlier still, at around 10:20 a.m., Amy had written to say there was no defined time frame for the requested information. She asked for any and all documents related to employment—internships, volunteering, etc.—in the area of substance abuse, behavioral or mental health counseling. If documentation was lacking, she asked for a list of every place she had provided services, with dates and any compensation, if applicable.\n\nFinally, at about 9:17 a.m., Amy had sent a morning note indicating that she did not fully understand what “new skills” referred to and that she would assemble what she could as soon as possible, noting that her materials were in storage.\n\nIn sum, the day’s exchanges tracing May 3, 2023, show Amy Mills attempting to respond to a formal information request concerning her counseling-related work history, education, internships, and related qualifications, while contending with repeated case-management changes, document-control issues within the firm, and ongoing uncertainties about exactly which materials would be deemed responsive or necessary for discovery and disclosure in her personal injury claim. The Whaley Law Firm’s responses emphasized the need for a clear list of counseling-related employment (including internships and volunteer work) with dates and any compensation, and they clarified that educational materials were not required. The communications also noted administrative changes within the firm (including the departure of a person named Celia) and attempted to align Amy’s documentation with the firm’s information-gathering process. Contact details referenced include The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the firm’s phone and email channels for Sarena M. Tuttle, the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager.",

      "natural_language": "Initial client contact in this matter occurred on May 4, 2023, when Amy Mills sent an email to Sarena M. Tuttle regarding her personal injury claim (case reference: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019). In the message, sent from Amy Mills’s bellabeautyinstitute@gmail.com, she described a daily reality she feels is often overlooked: the attachment she included had taken her hours to complete because of concentration difficulties, trouble with sit/stand rotation, difficulty typing, and the ability to see and read without the words becoming blurry and separating on the page. She explained that after finishing the attachment, her child needed help with a school excuse for being out sick and a permission slip to sign, and she could not do it. Because she is left-handed and could not hold a pen due to complete numbness, sharp electric zaps, and muscle spasms, she had to enlist someone else to write and sign her name. She stressed that this one task took hours and that the frustration stems from these unspoken struggles that should not be happening, all tied to the accident four years prior. She emphasized that at a casual glance she might appear fine, but unless someone is with her every moment, others cannot understand, and she often tries to hide it because she is tired of being asked if she is okay. She also expressed frustration with medical reports: multiple doctors reviewing the same scans and tests without her input, producing different and sometimes conflicting diagnoses, making it difficult to obtain the correct treatment. She characterized the past four years as a continuous cycle of cause and effect, stating it is “beyond frustrating” and “INSANE” in her reality as she works through these issues daily. She thanked Sarena for viewing the note and described it as a form of clarification and insight into something that should not be difficult to perform, yet is for her due to the condition from the accident. She indicated that she would send the completed document as soon as possible, with help from someone who would assist her in putting it together. The message concluded with her thanks and her name, Amy Mills.\n\nIn the same thread, the overarching email correspondence shows that Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm acknowledged the message the next day, May 3, 2023, commenting, “Awesome, thank you so much. Again, I apologize for the frustration and confusion.” Sarena’s signature identified her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and listed direct and office lines, along with her new email address, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier on May 3, 2023, there was a sequence of back-and-forth communications. At approximately 11:29 AM, Amy Mills indicated that she planned to list items and send them for review, asking for feedback on any needed changes and noting that the case had changed case managers multiple times within the firm, but documentation had not been forwarded. She referenced that the documentation was initially sent to the firm and suggested there had been confusion over where information was stored within the firm, and she mentioned forwardings to the firm’s current team as the case evolved. She also described confusion arising from the mix of roles—cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist (training and education), and that these lists might be relevant to her case.\n\nSarena responded at 11:51 AM, expressing some confusion and clarifying that Celia—the person with whom Amy had previously corresponded—was no longer with the firm, and that she would only accept the requested documents as needed. She asked for a straightforward list of any and all counseling/social-work-related work Amy had engaged in, whether as an internship or paid employment, and she reiterated contact information for the firm.\n\nAt 12:44 PM, Amy wrote again to express frustration, noting that she had already sent everything multiple times and that emails had been forwarded within the Whaley firm due to changes in case personnel. She explained that there appeared to be a mix-up between cosmetologist/beautician and social worker or certified counselor/therapist roles, as well as training and education records. She provided context about having shared screenshots as proof of time/date stamps before a deposit, and said she would search saved emails to re-forward the information. Amy also mentioned that she did not control how her information was stored or transferred within the firm, but she had remained transparent and forthcoming about all materials. She referenced discussions with Aaron about discovery and disclosure and explained that she sent everything because she did not know what would be important or pertinent to the case, and she believed that not sharing could prevent others from knowing what to request. She gave an example of a point of confusion: the firm had stated that educational material was not needed, yet internship materials appeared to be exactly that. She reiterated that gathering the information would take time and that she would continue to work on it, adding that the circumstances during the intervening period had been challenging.\n\nLater on May 3, 2023, Sarena replied at 1:06 PM with a clearer directive: she again apologized for the frustration and stated that what was needed at that moment was a list of Amy’s counseling/social-work-related jobs, including internships and paid positions, with dates and details on any compensation. She reminded Amy that she and Aaron had reviewed the file and emails to Celia, and again stressed that the requested documentation was what was needed, not educational material. She included the firm’s contact details in her signature.\n\nAmy’s response at 2:35 PM confirmed her intention to compile the list and send it for review, indicating she would allow Sarena to review the draft and request changes if necessary, and she expressed appreciation for proceeding from there.\n\nFinally, at 3:11 PM on May 3, Sarena wrote a concluding note to Amy, acknowledging that while Amy had said she would attach information, the only items attached were two screenshots of Amy’s emails with Celia. Sarena reiterated that Celia was no longer with the firm and that she was not privy to those conversations. She emphasized that the firm would only accept requested documents as needed and questioned where such information was stored in Amy’s file. She reminded Amy that in her deposition she had described training and education in substance abuse, behavioral and/or mental health counseling, which was the basis for the “new skills” reference. Sarena clarified that Amy’s counseling skills, not her cosmetology background, were relevant to the case. She urged Amy to provide the requested information promptly, noting that it might take a day or two to gather everything, and she asked Amy to start with a resume or list of counseling-related work, including the employers, volunteers, internships, dates, and compensation details, explicitly stating that educational material was not required. The message concluded with Sarena’s signature and updated contact information.\n\nIn summary, the case involves Amy Mills seeking information and clarification related to her personal injury claim arising from the 2019 incident, a request for documentation about her counseling- and social-work–related employment, internships, and training, and an ongoing exchange with The Whaley Law Firm to resolve inconsistencies in file handling, roles, and the specific materials required for discovery. Amy’s May 4 email adds a personal account of the daily functional impairments she experiences due to the accident, the impact on her ability to perform ordinary tasks, and her intent to provide a more complete document with assistance as soon as possible.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents the communications surrounding Amy Mills’ personal injury claim and a new Information Request from The Whaley Law Firm, dated early May 2023, with the case reference Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019.\n\nOn May 4, 2023 at 10:53 a.m. (the email from Sarena Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm’s Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager, sent to Amy Mills and to the firm’s additional recipients), Sarena opened with a cordial greeting to Amy and noted that nothing was attached to the prior message. She acknowledged that not all conditions are visible on the outside and expressed empathy for what Amy was enduring—physically and mentally, emotionally, financially, and spiritually—describing the incident as a life-changing event with lasting impact. Sarena stated they were not trying to create additional difficulty; if there were another way to obtain the information they would pursue it. She explained that while they understand tasks may present challenges and that they would grant as much time as the court allows, they needed to obtain information to resolve the matter. Specifically, the Defense was requesting Amy’s employment history, and the team could not move forward without it, though they understood it might take a couple of days for Amy to gather the information. Sarena proposed breaking down the request: begin with a simple list of places where Amy provided counseling or social work services, and then, later, gather more detailed information the Defense was seeking. She reiterated their willingness to help and support Amy through the process. The message closed with Sarena’s contact details and a note that this was her new email address.\n\nEarlier, Amy Mills had sent a reply on May 4, 2023 at 9:07 a.m. describing the daily challenges she faces, which she said are often overlooked. She explained that the attachment she had prepared took hours to complete due to concentration problems, difficulty with sitting and standing, issues with typing, and blurred or separating words when reading. She shared that her child needed a school excuse and a permission slip signed, and she could not even hold a pen because of numbness, sharp electric “zapps,” and muscle spasms—extending to the extent of needing someone else to write and sign for her. She described these struggles as an ordeal that affected not only herself but also her family, noting that the fatigue and pain were a direct result of the accident. Amy stated that at first glance people might not notice anything, but if someone was with her every second, they would understand. She expressed frustration with inconsistent reports from doctors who reviewed the same scans without her accompanying notes, leading to conflicting diagnoses and questioning how to obtain the correct treatment. She reflected on four years of ongoing issues and their impact on every dimension of her life, wishing the accident had never happened. She thanked Sarena for taking the time to view what she had attached as a way to provide insight into her daily reality. Amy indicated she would send the completed document and would have someone assist her in putting it together as soon as possible. She closed with thanks and her name, Amy Mills.\n\nThe thread then moves to earlier correspondence on May 3, 2023. At 3:11 p.m., Sarena replied to Amy, thanking her and apologizing for any frustration and confusion. She signed as before, including her role and contact information.\n\nAt 2:35 p.m. on May 3, Amy Mills responded, agreeing to list the requested items and to send something for Sarena to review. She said she would await Sarena’s guidance on whether to change, add, or modify the information, and expressed appreciation to proceed from that point.\n\nAt 1:06 p.m. on May 3, Sarena had written that Amy should provide a list of all jobs that fell under the counseling/social worker umbrella, whether internship or paid employment. She indicated that she had reviewed the file and that Aaron Whaley had reviewed emails to Cecilia, and she again requested a simple list of all such positions.\n\nAt 12:44 p.m. on May 3, Amy Mills wrote in frustration that she had sent everything multiple times and that emails had been forwarded to Whaley Law Firm staff as her case had seen multiple case managers, but documentation had not been forwarded. She questioned whether she was understanding correctly. She stated that it was a very difficult task after the time that had passed and the circumstances related to the case. Amy discussed what would be accepted versus rejected and suggested this contributed to confusion about how her information—cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, certified counselor/therapist, training and education, or a combination of these—was being categorized. She mentioned sending screenshots as proof of time/date stamps for the information even before a deposit took place and noted that she was attempting to locate saved emails with documents to re-forward. She asserted she had no control over how her information was stored, transferred, or otherwise handled within the law firm, yet reiterated her transparency and willingness to provide any information requested. She recalled having discussed discovery and disclosure with Aaron and emphasized that she sent everything because she did not know what might be important or pertinent to her case, and she questioned how Aaron could be fully aware of what he needed to request if she did not provide all materials. She cited a confusing point from the prior email: the statement that “we do not need educational material,” but the sentence cuts off with “the inte,” indicating that the message ended mid-thought.\n\nNote: The May 3, 2023, 12:44 p.m. email ends abruptly with the words “the inte,” and the remainder of that thought is not included in the record. The record, as provided, preserves all other content and timing from the thread.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills — Premise 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn the email thread titled “Re: Your Personal Injury Claim - New Request for Information,” the communications relate to Amy Mills’s personal injury claim and a new request for information from the defense. On June 1, 2023, at 4:56 p.m. Eastern Time, Amy Mills sent a message to Sarena Tuttle. In that note, she explained that she had been dealing with numerous issues, including difficulty locating her materials in storage. She also stated that she had just undergone an unexpected root canal procedure. She said she would send whatever documentation she could within the next 24 hours and expressed a hope that nothing had been left out, emphasizing that she did not want to do anything wrong. She closed with a quick update and thanks, signing as Amy Mills.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on May 4, 2023, at 10:54 a.m., Sarena Tuttle replied to Amy. Sarena explained that nothing was attached to the prior communication. She acknowledged that the circumstances were difficult and that the impact of the incident extended beyond the physical injury to include mental, emotional, financial, and spiritual effects. She emphasized that the goal was not to make things more difficult, and that if information could be obtained by other means they would pursue those options. She noted that the defense was currently requesting Amy’s employment history and that the matter could not move forward until that information was received, while recognizing that gathering it might take a few days. Sarena proposed breaking down the request to start with a list of places where Amy had provided counseling or social work services, with the intention of gradually gathering the more detailed information the defense sought. She reassured Amy that the firm was there to help and that they were willing to do whatever was needed to assist her. The message included Sarena’s contact details: Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext. 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, with a note to “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.”\n\nIn that same day’s correspondence, at 9:07 a.m., Amy Mills wrote describing the daily challenges she faced. She detailed that she had spent hours on a document due to concentration difficulties, the need to manage sit/stand rotation, trouble typing, and visual disturbances that caused words to blur and separate on the page. She mentioned having to write a school excuse for her child and being unable to hold a pen because of numbness, sharp electric \"zaps,\" and muscle spasms, all related to the accident. She described the frustration of encountering unspoken struggles that were not visible at a casual glance and the ongoing difficulty of obtaining consistent medical diagnoses from different doctors who often relied only on scans and test results without her input. She stated that she would send the completed document and that someone would help her put it together as soon as possible, noting that this had become a daily reality she continued to manage. She signed off with thanks and again stated her intention to send the completed document soon.\n\nEarlier on May 3, 2023, at 3:11 p.m., Sarena replied to Amy with appreciation, saying, “Awesome, thank you so much,” and adding, “Again, I apologize for the frustration and confusion.” The signature block identified Sarena M. Tuttle as Litigation Paralegal and Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the same Louisville address and contact details as above.\n\nMoments later, at 2:35 p.m. on May 3, Amy Mills said she would list the items and send them for review, inviting Sarena to advise if anything should be added or changed before proceeding.\n\nAt 1:06 p.m. on May 3, Sarena sent a direct request to Amy: she needed a list of Amy’s jobs that fell under the counseling/social worker umbrella, including any internships or paid employment. She confirmed that both she and another colleague, Aaron, had reviewed the file and communications to Cecilia, and asked Amy simply to provide a list of all roles under that umbrella.\n\nEarlier still, at 12:44 p.m. on May 3, Amy Mills vented frustration about having sent all requested information multiple times. She explained that emails related to her case had been forwarded to The Whaley Law Firm (WLF) because her case had changed case managers several times, but the documentation had not been forwarded consistently. She questioned whether she was understood correctly. She expressed that compiling and submitting documentation was an extremely difficult task given the time that had passed and the circumstances affecting the case. She discussed potential confusion surrounding whether items would be accepted and suggested that emails containing documentation should be filed for present or future use. She speculated about mixups involving titles such as cosmetologist/beautician, social worker, and certified counselor/therapist, along with training and education, and indicated that she had attempted to provide screen shots as proof of time/date stamps, even before a deposit, to support the information. She stated she was seeking saved emails to re-forward the documentation and remarked that she had little control over how her information was stored or transferred within her case.\n\nThe chain ends with Amy’s partially complete note, cut off mid-sentence: “I have no control over how my information in stored, transferred, or otherwise for my case within.” \n\nIn summary, the record shows Amy Mills communicating on June 1, 2023, to provide an update and promise to send available materials within 24 hours, following an earlier exchange in early May where the defense’s information requests prompted detailed, repeated attempts by Amy to supply employment and counseling/social work history, a substantial explanation of the personal and health-related difficulties she was experiencing, and ongoing coordination with Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm regarding how best to gather and organize the information.",

      "natural_language": "In the Amy Mills Premise case (case file: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019), the client is Amy Mills. The record reflects a sequence of late winter to summer 2023 communications between counsel concerning discovery, a discovery demand, and mediation scheduling.\n\nBeginning in February 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm indicated he did not object to Betsy Catron’s motion and expressed an interest in moving mediation forward, stating he would like to set mediation in April or May. On March 13, 2023, Betsy asked whether Aaron’s side could provide a demand by the end of the month; Aaron replied on March 14, 2023, that he “hop[e] so.”\n\nOn May 12, 2023, Betsy again inquired, asking, “When can I expect a demand from your client?” and she appears to have awaited a response. By June 16, 2023, Aaron responded, providing the demand and noting that he had added it to a Dropbox folder, with the message: “Betsy, here you go. Thank you for your patience. I have added the demand to a dropbox folder.” The link provided was https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0imoh5irinhb1bb/AACZwtaR1soOYXeuy9ox1F4ta?dl=0.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Betsy wrote again, requesting responses to the discovery served on April 28, 2023, and asked whether the 30-day response period could be satisfied by responding at mediation. She also indicated she was coordinating a mediation with Judge Knopf and sought Aaron’s availability for late August or early September. Aaron replied on the same day, June 27, 2023, at 10:24:41 a.m. (-0400): “I will get the discovery to you asap. Yes I am agreeable to your response at mediation. My schedule is good late August early September.”",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nThis note is a forwarded email thread regarding the Amy Mills matter. The forward, labeled “__Fwd: Amy Mills__,” was sent on June 27, 2023 at 10:25:11 a.m. by Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to the addresses Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, Bryce Koon, and Sarena Tuttle. The subject line was simply “RE: Amy Mills.” The message begins with, “We need to respond to these requests,” and then includes a chain of prior communications tied to the case.\n\nThe forwarded portion contains a message from Betsy Catron dated June 27, 2023 at 10:21 a.m. Betsy, identified as an attorney with Vine Center in Lexington, KY, wrote to Aaron Whaley and Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019. She thanked Aaron and asked that responses be provided to the discovery served on April 28, 2023, noting that she had attached those discovery requests. She also observed that the demand in the file carries a 30-day response period and asked if the responding party could address the demand at mediation. Betsy stated she was having her assistant check for mediation dates with Judge Knopf and inquired about Aaron’s availability for late August or early September.\n\nThe email thread includes earlier correspondence. On June 16, 2023, Aaron replied to Betsy and to Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, saying, “Betsy, here you go. Thank you for your patience. I have added the demand to a dropbox folder,” and provided the link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0imoh5irinhb1bb/AACZwtaR1soOYXeuy9ox1F4ta?dl=0.\n\nPrior to that, Betsy had written on May 12, 2023, asking, “When can I expect a demand from your client?” Aaron’s response at that time is not quoted in full, but the thread includes Betsy’s signature with her contact information for Vine Center—333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, phone 859.422.6000, fax 859.422.6001, and the website www.whtlaw.com.\n\nEarlier still, on March 14, 2023, Aaron replied to Betsy with the message, “I hope so.” Betsy had asked on March 13, 2023, whether Aaron could obtain a demand by the end of the month. The portion of the thread beginning February 13, 2023 shows Aaron writing, “I don’t object to your motion. I would like to get mediation set in April or May—,” followed by Aaron’s full signature block for Whaley Law Firm, including the office address at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, and phone numbers. The emails repeatedly include standard external-email cautions in the signatures.\n\nIn summary, the file documents a back-and-forth from February through June 2023 regarding mediation timing and the production of a demand and discovery responses. By June 27, 2023, Betsy was requesting responses to discovery served on April 28, 2023, and to know whether the parties could handle the 30-day demand response at mediation, with plans to pursue mediation dates with Judge Knopf in late August or early September. The June 16, 2023 email confirms that the demand had been uploaded to a Dropbox folder for access.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, W. Bryce Koon, Esq., of The Whaley Law Firm (located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-365-5043; fax 502-237-3207) sent an email titled “RE: Amy Mills” to the distribution list for Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, including Aaron Whaley and Sarena Tuttle. The message, which carried the date Tue, Jun 27, 2023 at 10:27:36 AM (Eastern time zone offset -0400), stated, “I will work on them now.” The email also contained a standard confidentiality and privilege notice indicating that the electronic message is intended only for the named recipient and outlining steps to take if received in error, including contacting The Whaley Law Firm and not using or forwarding the information.\n\nEarlier that same day, Aaron Whaley forwarded a message titled “Fwd: Amy Mills” to Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, Bryce Koon, and Sarena Tuttle with the note, “We need to respond to these requests.” This forwarded message included a prior thread beginning with Betsy Catron’s reply.\n\nIn Betsy Catron’s June 27, 2023 email (dated 10:21 AM), she acknowledged Aaron’s message and requested responses to the discovery served on 4/28/23, noting that the discovery was attached. She also asked whether a 30-day response could be accommodated by providing responses at mediation, and she inquired about dates for mediation with Judge Knopf, asking for availability in late August or early September. Betsy signed with her attorney information for Vine Center at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, providing the firm’s phone number (859.422.6000) and fax (859.422.6001) and listing the website www.whtlaw.com. A standard caution about external emails was included in the thread.\n\nThe thread also showed prior communications from Aaron Whaley. On June 16, 2023, at 3:26 PM, Aaron informed Betsy that he had added the demand to a Dropbox folder and provided a link to the folder: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0imoh5irinhb1bb/AACZwtaR1soOYXeuy9ox1F4ta?dl=0. This message followed Betsy’s earlier inquiries about the timing of the demand, including Betsy’s May 12, 2023 email asking, “When can I expect a demand from your client?” and Aaron’s March 14, 2023 reply, “I hope so,” in response to Betsy’s March 13, 2023 question: “Do you think you can get me a demand by the end of the month?” The preceding February 13, 2023 message from Aaron to Betsy indicated, “I don’t object to your motion. I would like to get mediation set in April or May,” followed by the signature blocks that included his contact information and a note about external email cautions.\n\nIn sum, the record documents ongoing discovery-related communications in the Amy Mills Premise case, including: a discovery response timeline being discussed (with a 30-day expectation), the plan to address those responses at mediation, the scheduling considerations with Judge Knopf for late summer or early fall, and the involvement of both Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 and counsel from The Whaley Law Firm in coordinating these efforts. The exchange includes multiple attachments and references to a Dropbox link for the demand, and the thread repeatedly notes the cautionary boilerplate about external emails.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise 04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nIn the Amy Mills matter, communications relating to discovery and mediation unfolded over several months in 2023. On July 21, 2023, Bryce Koon of Whaley Law Firm reported via email that he had sent Amy Mills the discovery questions but had been unable to reach her. He stated that he had called, texted, and emailed without receiving a response.\n\nThat same July 21 email included a forwarded message thread. Aaron Whaley’s initial entry in the thread, sent Friday, July 21, 2023 at 10:03 AM, was directed to Bryce Koon and Sarena Tuttle under the subject Fwd: Amy Mills, and it contained Betsy Catron’s inquiry about discovery responses. Betsy had previously sent on July 21, 2023 at 9:54 AM a message to Aaron Whaley asking, “Aaron, when can we expect responses to our discovery?” and noted that Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 had a corresponding file alias at AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nThe thread shows earlier exchanges between Betsy Catron and Aaron Whaley. In a June 27, 2023 email, Aaron replied at 10:25 AM that he would get the discovery to Betsy asap and that he was agreeable to receiving a response at mediation, with his schedule open for late August to early September. Betsy had previously asked, in a June 27, 2023 email at 10:21 AM, for the discovery responses served on 4/28/23, attaching those documents. She also asked whether the 30-day response requirement could be satisfied by responding at mediation and inquired about availability for a mediation with Judge Knopf in late August or early September.\n\nThe correspondence also includes a June 16, 2023 email from Aaron to Betsy Catron and Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, in which Aaron said he had added the demand to a Dropbox folder and provided the link: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0imoh5irinhb1bb/AACZwtaR1soOYXeuy9ox1F4ta?dl=0.\n\nEarlier still, Betsy Catron had written on May 12, 2023, asking when a demand could be expected from Aaron’s client. Aaron’s response in this thread was not until June 16, 2023, when he provided the Dropbox link containing the demand.\n\nThe record also includes communications from February 13, 2023, with Aaron stating that he did not object to Betsy’s motion and that he would like to get mediation set in April or May, followed by repeated signatures for Aaron Whaley, whose firm is Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone number 502-583-4022 (the signature blocks also include the firm’s standard contact details). The chain shows a March 13, 2023 exchange in which Betsy asked if a demand could be provided by the end of the month; Aaron replied on March 14, 2023, “I hope so.” Betsy had previously asked on March 13, 2023 (2:59 PM) “Do you think you can get me a demand by the end of the month?”\n\nThe emails include standard external email caution footers indicating caution when opening attachments and links from external senders. The material also shows repeated signature blocks for Betsy Catron, Attorney at Vine Center, with the address 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, and contact details (P 859.422.6000; F 859.422.6001; www.whtlaw.com), and for Aaron Whaley at Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the same phone number.\n\nIn summary, the file records a sequence of discovery-related discussions and mediation planning spanning February through July 2023, culminating in July 21, 2023, when a Whaley Law Firm representative reported difficulty contacting Amy Mills and shared the prior discovery and discovery-related communications with the involved parties. The underlying file maintained the case reference Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 and the alias AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com for the materials connected to the matter.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn the matter titled Amy Mills, counsel communications show ongoing discovery and demand negotiations between Betsy R. Catron of Vine Center and Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, with activity spanning from February through July 2023. The record begins with an exchange on February 13, 2023, when Aaron Whaley wrote to Betsy Catron that he did not object to her motion and that he would like to have mediation set in April or May.\n\nOn March 13, 2023, Betsy asked Aaron whether he thought he could get a demand by the end of the month. Aaron replied on March 14, 2023 with the brief, “I hope so.” The thread continued as Betsy followed up on May 12, 2023, asking, “When can I expect a demand from your client?” and stating that she had attached related materials.\n\nSubsequently, on June 16, 2023, Aaron responded that he had added the demand to a Dropbox folder, providing a link to the folder for Betsy to access: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0imoh5irinhb1bb/AACZwtaR1soOYXeuy9ox1F4ta?dl=0. The next day, June 27, 2023, at 10:21 AM Betsy wrote back, thanking Aaron and requesting (a) the discovery responses served on 4/28/23, noting that she had attached them, (b) clarification about the 30-day response period for the demand and whether the parties could allow a response at mediation, and (c) Aaron’s availability for mediation in late August or early September, as she was arranging a mediation with Judge Knopf.\n\nAaron replied at 10:25 AM on June 27, 2023, agreeing to provide the discovery responses promptly, confirming that he was agreeable to a mediation-based response, and reiterating that his schedule was suitable for late August to early September.\n\nOn July 21, 2023, Betsy again asked Aaron when the discovery responses would be provided. Aaron’s reply, dated July 21, 2023 at 11:44 AM, stated that they were working on it. He explained that Amy had sent the answers to Sarena while Sarena was out on bereavement leave, and those responses had become lost in the shuffle; Aaron noted that they had found the responses and were in the process of drafting answers.\n\nThe thread shows that the matter involves the delivery of a discovery response for Amy Mills Premise and a demand related to the case, with mediation contemplated for late summer to early fall and ongoing coordination between the two law firms. The communications include direct references to specific dates, the Dropbox link containing the demand, and the noted issue of lost responses during a bereavement-related absence. The contact details in the correspondence identify Betsy Catron as the attorney for Vine Center in Lexington, KY, and Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, with associated email addresses and firm information reflected in the exchanges.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise file identified as Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. The subject of the exchange is a forwarded message titled “FW: Amy Mills.” On August 9, 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm spoke with Amy Mills by phone to gather additional information. Amy stated she does not have any documents related to the jobs at issue, with the most recent position occurring eight years ago. Aaron added the information Amy could remember, and in the accompanying note Bryce Koon instructed to finish up and add something noting that Amy cannot recall specific details like phone numbers, with a plan to supplement if those memories change. The note also states that, aside from what Amy recalled, this is good for filing. Amy has not applied for any jobs in the relevant area since her last job, and there is nothing responsive to the first Request for Production (RPD).\n\nThe surrounding email thread provides the progression of discovery communications. Earlier in the thread, on February 13, 2023, Betsy Catron asked whether discovery could be set or a demand could be provided by the end of the month; Aaron Whaley replied that he did not object to the motion and would like to set mediation in April or May. On March 14, 2023, Betsy asked if a demand could be provided by month’s end, and Aaron responded, “I hope so.” By May 12, 2023, Betsy was again asking when a demand could be expected. On June 16, 2023, Aaron sent a message to Betsy and Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, announcing that the demand had been added to a Dropbox folder, and provided a link to that folder.\n\nOn June 27, 2023, Aaron told Betsy that he would get the discovery to her as soon as possible and that he was agreeable to the opposing party’s response at mediation; he also noted that his schedule was favorable for mediation in late August or early September. Betsy replied that she had attached the discovery served on April 28, 2023 and inquired whether the parties were agreeable to a mediation timeline and dates with Judge Knopf; Aaron confirmed he would be available and reiterated willingness to proceed. Betsy later indicated that the firm was working on the responses, explaining that Amy had previously sent answers to Sarena while on bereavement leave and those responses had been mislaid; they had been found and were being drafted.\n\nIn late July 2023, Betsy asked when discovery responses could be expected. Aaron replied that the team was working on them and that the answers Amy had previously provided were located and would be drafted into the current set of responses. Betsy’s communications through July include the note that the discovery responses were anticipated and that a mediation timeline was being considered.\n\nIn August 2023, the thread shows further activity. On August 8, 2023, Aaron directed Bryce Koon to draft the discovery responses with blanks for any missing information. Bryce responded that he had in fact attempted contact with Amy—texting, emailing, and calling—with no response. Later that day and into August 9, 2023, the thread documents the ongoing process: Aaron’s August 9 email reiterates the phone conversation with Amy, confirms the lack of documents, records the eight-year gap since the most recent job, and notes the plan to supplement if new information becomes available. The August 9 note also includes the directive to finalize the filing and to add the caveat about Amy’s memory for certain details, such as phone numbers.\n\nThroughout this period, the communications reflect the parties’ attempts to obtain complete discovery responses and to coordinate mediation timing. The thread references the assistant contacts, the disposition of discovery responses, the status of Amy’s information, and the use of a Dropbox folder to house the demand. The matter remains set toward resolution via mediation, with mediation discussions anticipated for late August to early September, and the overall objective of finalizing discovery responses despite the gaps in available information. Aaron Whaley’s and Betsy Catron’s signatures and contact details appear in the thread, along with the contact information for Betsy’s firm, Vine Center, located at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with a private phone number listed as 859.422.6000 and a fax number of 859.422.6001.\n\nIn summary, the case notes reflect ongoing discovery efforts regarding Amy Mills’ work history, the absence of documentation for the relevant jobs (the most recent being eight years prior), and a sequence of communications dating from February through August 2023 aimed at drafting discovery responses, securing missing information (including supervisor names and wage amounts), coordinating mediation, and organizing documents via a Dropbox link, all while acknowledging Amy’s limited memory for certain details and the plan to supplement as information becomes available.",

The header shows the message came from Sarena to Aaron Whaley and was cc’d to Bryce Koon, to a file labeled Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, and to Jessica Bottorff, with the subject line “Re: Amy Mills Medical Records.”\n\nThe body of the thread begins with Sarena replying “Absolutely.” The thread then outlines a sequence of messages exchanged on August 9, 2023. Earlier in the day, at about 11:42 AM, Aaron Whaley asked whether the team could update and clean up the records, ensuring certified records for every provider as well as the associated bills, with all information easily accessible in Amy Mills’s file. He noted that Amy Mills was still receiving treatment from Bluegrass Orthopaedics, specifically Dr. Huff, even though the team had marked treatment as complete, and he requested updated records from Bluegrass because Mills had seen Dr. Huff about a month earlier and had been referred to an orthopedic clinic in Nashville for her back.\n\nAround 11:53 AM, Sarena replied, “I’m on it,” and she signed her message with her full title and contact details. At about 12:09 PM, Sarena wrote that she had reviewed Mills Cert MRs and found they were in the Litigation Folder, properly labeled by Date Recvd and Provider, and that she would send all new requests that day to ensure everything was up to date. She again signed with her title and contact information, including the notice to please note her new email address.\n\nLater, at roughly 1:51 PM, Aaron responded again, thanking Sarena and asking whether she or someone else could also save the medical records to the medical tab, including the bills and the billed amount for each provider. The thread shows the ongoing efforts to organize Amy Mills’s medical records, certify the providers, and ensure that billing information is complete and easily accessible in her file.\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications were directed within The Whaley Law Firm and included the relevant participants in Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019’s matter, with Sarena M. Tuttle consistently handling the organization and verification of Mills’s medical records, and Aaron Whaley directing the need for up-to-date, comprehensive documentation. The record also notes that the correspondence comes from and goes to The Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville, Kentucky offices, with Sarena’s signature listing her phone numbers and her new email address.",

In the forwarded message, Aaron stated that, in preparation for mediation that week, he wanted to review Amy Mills’s Facebook history, specifically the period before her fall, in order to contrast the before-and-after. He asked to receive Amy’s best pre-fall and post-fall pictures, emphasizing normal, social pictures, and directed that the information be downloaded as part of the process.\n\nThe forwarded content included a prior message from Sarena M. Tuttle dated September 14, 2023, at 9:44 a.m., with the subject “Re: Download Facebook,” sent to Bryce Koon and cc’d to Aaron Whaley. Sarena noted that if Amy were using a desktop—which she recommended—it would be a little different and provided the following steps: click the upper right profile picture, click Settings & Privacy, click Your Facebook Information, and click Download.

      "natural_language": "In October 2023, in the matter of Amy Mills (Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019), communications were exchanged between Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm and Anna Mercer, the clinical assistant to Dr. Wallace Huff at Bluegrass Orthopaedics, regarding arranging a telephone conference for Amy Mills. The parties discussed the structure and timing of the session, with Bluegrass noting that a telephone conference costs $1,000 per 30 minutes and that these conferences are typically held on Tuesday afternoons. On October 6, 2023, at 9:36 AM, Anna Mercer stated that they could arrange a phone call with Dr. Huff and that the conference would be scheduled on a Tuesday afternoon. Aaron Whaley responded later that day, at 12:45 PM, saying he was free that Tuesday if it worked.\n\nDr. Huff’s availability was then proposed for two possible dates: on October 6, 2023, at 8:29 AM, Anna Mercer suggested 10/24/2023 at 3:45 PM or 10/31/2023 at 3:30 PM and asked which date would work, promising to send the invoice once chosen. On October 16, 2023, at 10:13 AM, Aaron Whaley replied that 10/24/2023 works for him. At 10:40 AM that same day, Anna confirmed she had scheduled the telephone conference for 10/24/2023 at 3:45 PM and asked for a fax number to send the invoice, noting that payment would need to be received 48 business hours before the conference to avoid cancellation or postponement. At 10:44 AM, Aaron provided a contact number, 502-357-9939, in response.\n\nThe invoice was subsequently faxed. On October 17, 2023, at 11:07 AM, Anna Mercer wrote, “Thank you! I faxed the invoice yesterday.” Later that day, at 12:43:51 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, “I received it, and the check has gone out.” The thread shows that the payment was being handled via a mailed check following the invoicing process.\n\nThroughout the correspondence, standard confidentiality notices were included in each message, reflecting the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (18 U.S.C. sections 2510-2521). The emails also contained the contact information for the parties: Anna Mercer as the Clinical Assistant to Dr. Wallace Huff of Bluegrass Orthopaedics, located at 3401 Yorkshire Medical Park, Lexington, KY 40509, with the office phone number (859) 263-5140, Ext. 226; and Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-583-4022. The signatures also listed websites and social media handles for Bluegrass Orthopaedics and related details.\n\nIn sum, the parties arranged a 10/24/2023 telephone conference with Dr. Huff at 3:45 PM, agreed on a fee structure of $1,000 per 30 minutes, and completed invoicing and payment steps with the invoice faxed on or around October 16, 2023 and the check issued after the receipt of the faxed invoice, with confidentiality notices appended to every message.",

He stated that he had just met with Dr. Huff and that he attached the note Dr. Huff prepared after the meeting. Dr. Huff has referred Amy to another doctor at the same clinic, Dr. Hunt, for an evaluation of her neck. Dr. Huff wants Amy to obtain a new cervical MRI first, and he instructed her to call and follow up about that MRI. He also recommended that Amy see a provider for pain management for her headaches. Whaley closed the message by asking Amy to let him know if she has any questions and to confirm that she received the message.\n\nFor reference, the message was sent from Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022, agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn late October 2023, the Whaley Law Firm began coordinating medical steps for Amy Mills following a Dr. Huff meeting. On October 24, 2023 at 4:11 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Amy Mills (and to others) after his meeting with Dr. Huff. He said he had met with Dr. Huff and attached the note Dr. Huff wrote after the meeting. Dr. Huff had referred Amy to Dr. Hunt at the same clinic for an evaluation of her neck, and he wanted Amy to obtain a new cervical MRI first, so she would need to call and follow up about that. Dr. Huff also recommended that Amy see someone for pain management to address her headaches. Whaley invited Amy to ask any questions and to confirm that she received the note.\n\nThat same day, October 24, 2023, at 8:42 PM, Amy Mills replied that she had received the note, would print it, and would make an appointment with her primary physician to discuss it as well as to take further steps forward. She thanked Whaley for the information.\n\nOn November 10, 2023, at 12:57 PM, Whaley sent a follow-up message to Amy Mills, checking in to see whether she had made that appointment yet.\n\nThen, on November 28, 2023, at about 3:45 PM, Amy Mills wrote that they had attempted to proceed but encountered a problem: the MRI machine was down, and after it was repaired she received another call to reschedule. She was told the MRI would be scheduled sometime in December due to the backlog of MRI orders. Amy also stated that she had been down and in bed for over a week with a terrible, debilitating migraine, which explained the delayed reply.\n\nFinally, on December 5, 2023 at 2:22 PM (14:22:54 -0500), Aaron Whaley responded: “I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know when you get rescheduled.” The email exchange demonstrates the plan Dr. Huff laid out—referral to Dr. Hunt for neck evaluation, the need for a new cervical MRI, and consideration of pain management for headaches—along with ongoing efforts to coordinate appointments despite MRI machine downtime and Amy’s migraine-related illness. The communications include the sender and recipient details, with Whaley’s Whaley Law Firm sign-off at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the firm’s phone number, 502-583-4022.",

In the message, he wrote to Amy Mills and included the Bellabeautyinstitute email address in the To field, with a CC to amymillspremisez995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, and dated 14:44:43 -0500. The opening line asked, “Amy, hope you had a good Christmas. Has the MRI been rescheduled?”\n\nThis email thread traces back through several prior messages. On December 8, 2023 at approximately 8:03 AM, Amy Mills replied, “Ok, I will let you know.” Earlier, on December 5, 2023 at 2:23 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, “I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know when you get rescheduled.”\n\nBefore that, on November 28, 2023 at about 3:45 PM, Amy Mills explained that they had attempted scheduling but the MRI machine was down. She noted it would be fixed and then rescheduled, with an expectation that the appointment would occur sometime in December given the backlog of MRI orders. She also stated that she had been “down and in bed for over a week with a terrible debilitating migraine,” which accounted for the delay in replying.\n\nEarlier still, on November 10, 2023 at 12:57 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Amy Mills, seeking to confirm whether she had made the appointment yet.\n\nOn October 24, 2023 at 8:42 PM, Amy Mills responded that she had received the message, would print it, and would make an appointment with her primary physician to discuss further steps. She concluded with, “Thank You, Amy Mills.”\n\nEarlier that same day, at 4:11 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Amy Mills: he had just met with Dr. Huff and attached the note Dr. Huff made after the meeting. Dr. Huff had referred Amy to Dr. Hunt, another doctor at the clinic, for a neck evaluation. Dr. Huff wanted Amy to obtain a new cervical MRI first, so she would need to call and follow up regarding that MRI. He also recommended that Amy see a specialist for pain management for her headaches. Whaley invited Amy to reach out with any questions and to confirm that she received the message.\n\nThe thread then included multiple reiterations of Aaron Whaley’s and Amy Mills’s communications, followed by the standard firm signature blocks for Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm, including his full contact information at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, phone number 502-583-4022.",

      "natural_language": "In the case file titled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019, involving client Amy Mills, the notes describe communications surrounding a Dr. Huff meeting and subsequent medical-legal actions. On January 3, 2024, the attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Amy Mills and the Bella Beauty Institute, with Amy copied, asking whether the MRI had been rescheduled. He stated that the MRI needed to be completed so that he could send the results to an expert to determine if revision surgery might be necessary and to assess whether a neck issue could be causing Amy’s headaches. If the neck could be ruled out as the source of the headaches, they could move on to treatment for the headaches, and experts could offer an opinion. He noted that obtaining this information was necessary in order to reach the financial figures sought in the case. He also warned that the longer they waited, the worse things could be if the case went to trial, and he needed the information to push the defense toward trial and improve the outcome.\n\nThe email trail shows a back-and-forth regarding the MRI rescheduling. On Friday, December 29, 2023, at 2:44 PM, Aaron wrote: “Amy, hope you had a good Christmas. Has the MRI been rescheduled?” Prior to that, on Friday, December 8, 2023 at 8:03 AM, Amy Mills replied, “Ok, I will let you know.” Earlier, on Tuesday, December 5, 2023 at 2:23 PM, Aaron had written, “I’m sorry to hear that. Let me know when you get rescheduled.” And on Tuesday, November 28, 2023 at 3:45 PM, Amy Mills replied: “We did but then the machine was down for the MRI. It was to be fixed and then I got another call for it to be rescheduled. I was told it would be for sometime in December with the backlog of MRI orders. I have been down and in bed for over a week with a terrible debilitating migraine. This is the reason for the long awaited reply.”\n\nThe timeline also shows prior outreach: on Friday, November 10, 2023 at 12:57 PM, Aaron asked Amy if she had made the appointment yet. On Tuesday, October 24, 2023 at 8:42 PM, Amy Mills wrote that she had received the note and planned to print it and make an appointment with her primary physician to discuss next steps; she thanked Aaron. Earlier that same day, at 4:11 PM, Aaron informed Amy that he had just met with Dr. Huff and attached the note from that meeting. Dr. Huff had referred Amy to another clinician at the same clinic, Dr. Hunt, for an evaluation of her neck. He instructed that Amy should obtain a new cervical MRI first and follow up with that appointment, and he also recommended that she see someone for pain management for her headaches. He asked Amy to let him know if she had any questions and to confirm receipt of the message.\n\nIn summary, the communications chronicle the plan to obtain a new cervical MRI, to evaluate the neck’s potential role in Amy’s headaches through a referral to Dr. Hunt, and to pursue pain management for the headaches, all in the context of advancing the case with the necessary expert opinions and trial readiness. The MRI’s scheduling, the machine’s downtime, and Amy’s health episodes (including a prolonged debilitating migraine) contributed to delays in obtaining the needed information for the case’s valuation and potential trial strategy.",

      "natural_language": "This is a narrative summary of the Amy Mills case (Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019), focusing on the correspondence between Amy Mills and attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm regarding medical imaging, neck evaluation, head- and neck-related symptoms, and settlement dynamics following a personal injury.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, Aaron Whaley emailed the recipient(s) about whether Amy had been able to obtain an MRI on January 6. In the preceding exchanges, Amy Mills had written on January 4, 2024 that the MRI had been scheduled for Saturday, January 6, 2024. She expressed strong personal urgency and frustration, noting that she had been dealing with severe agony from the injury and could not rush the process. She stated there had been no Christmas for her kids due to her condition. She also described a botched root canal—specifically that the filling had failed and the tooth was exposed—and that extraction could not be performed because of her neck injury and related issues, necessitating surgical removal. \n\nAmy also commented on the financial aspects of the case. She described the compensation offer as insulting and noted that the four months of 2019 before she was hurt were twice as much, plus more than the annual income estimate; she asserted the tax returns showed this, but the overall impact was a loss from not working for the rest of the year. She claimed that Jason had already made an offer, and that he earns as an owner/operator truck driver for the four-plus years the case had been ongoing. She asserted that a quick search suggested his specialized hazard-pay salary in Kentucky was $84,000, but, in reality, he performed only one contract per month, which she implied equated to the same figure.\n\nAmy identified several medical- malpractice concerns, including a failure to diagnose and prolonged treatment from the initial ER visit, a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a possible failed spinal fusion. During their ongoing negotiations, she noted that the defense’s lawyer would not even consider returning with a higher offer, suggesting that such behavior could be frowned upon by licensing and insurance boards.\n\nAs a side note regarding the scheduled Saturday appointment, Amy warned that if the forecasted snow materialized, she would not attend the appointment due to safety concerns. She attributed this caution to PTSD or anxiety, emphasizing she could not risk potential future harm, and she pledged to keep Whaley posted.\n\nIn a January 3, 2024 message, Aaron asked whether the MRI had been rescheduled, explaining that obtaining the MRI was necessary so he could send the results to an expert to determine whether Amy needed a revision surgery and to assess whether the neck might be causing her headaches. He emphasized that ruling out a neck-related cause for the headaches was important to proceed with treatment for the headaches and to obtain expert opinions. He also noted that having this information was essential to determine the financial numbers sought in the case and that delaying the process could worsen the trial position.\n\nEarlier communications included a December 29, 2023 email in which Aaron asked Amy if the MRI had been rescheduled, and a December 8, 2023 reply in which Amy said she would let him know. On December 5, 2023, Aaron expressed sympathy and requested that Amy inform him when she was rescheduled. In a November 28, 2023 message, Amy explained that the MRI had been scheduled but the machine went down, followed by another reschedule request due to backlog; she noted she had been sidelined by a debilitating migraine and bedridden for over a week, which contributed to the delayed reply. On November 10, 2023, Aaron checked in again to see if Amy had scheduled the appointment. On October 24, 2023, Amy acknowledged receipt of the note and said she would print it and discuss it with her primary physician to plan further steps. Earlier that same day, October 24, 2023 at 4:11 PM, Aaron reported that he had met with Dr. Huff; he attached the note Dr. Huff wrote after the meeting, which indicated a referral to Dr. Hunt for a neck evaluation and to obtain a new cervical MRI first, with a recommendation to pursue pain management for headaches. He instructed Amy to call and follow up about the MRI, and to let him know if she had questions and that she received the information.\n\nThe review of the threaded correspondence also includes standard practice details: the Whaley Law Firm’s contact information appears at the end of the exchange, including the firm’s address—712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222—and phone number, 502-583-4022.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premises file dated 04-26-2019. This narrative summarizes the email exchanges and accompanying notes related to Amy Mills, Dr. Huff, Dr. Hunt, MRI scheduling, neck evaluation, pain management, and associated settlement discussions, covering communications from October 2023 through January 2024.\n\nIn the brief notes surrounding Dr. Huff’s meeting, attorney Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm communicated with Amy Mills (and copies to other recipients) to provide updates and coordinate next steps. The exchange began with a note dated October 24, 2023, in which Whaley advised that Dr. Huff had referred Amy to Dr. Hunt for a neck evaluation and that she should obtain a new cervical MRI first. He also recommended that Amy see a pain management professional for her headaches and asked her to confirm receipt of the notice and to raise any questions she had.\n\nAmy responded later on October 24, 2023, saying she would print the note and discuss it with her primary physician, and she thanked Whaley for the information. The thread continued with a follow-up from Whaley on November 10, 2023, asking whether Amy had scheduled that appointment.\n\nOn November 28, 2023, Amy explained that the MRI machine was down, and there was a backlog for rescheduling; she also described being bedridden for over a week due to a severe migraine. In her message, she noted that a December reschedule had been communicated and that she had continued to experience substantial symptoms.\n\nWhaley responded on December 5, 2023, expressing sympathy for what Amy was going through and inviting her to inform him when she was able to reschedule. Amy replied on December 8, 2023, that she would let him know. A follow-up from Whaley on December 29, 2023 asked whether the MRI had been rescheduled, extending hope for movement on scheduling during the holiday period.\n\nAs January 2024 approached, Whaley pressed the matter again. In an exchange dated January 3, 2024, he emphasized the need for the MRI to be completed so he could forward the results to an expert. The goal was to determine whether Amy would require a revision surgery and to assess whether the neck might be contributing to her headaches. He noted that delaying the MRI could hinder obtaining favorable settlement figures by trial, stressing that progress toward trial depended on having this information.\n\nAmy replied on January 4, 2024 with a detailed message concerning the upcoming MRI scheduled for Saturday, January 6, 2024. She stated that she hoped to have the MRI done but was unwilling to rush it, given the ongoing agony from her injury and the impact on her family—specifically mentioning that there had not been a Christmas for her children due to her condition. She also described a botched root canal, where the filling had failed and the tooth was exposed; she explained that extraction was not an option because of her neck injury and related issues, so surgical removal would be necessary. \n\nAdditionally, Amy vented about the financial aspects of the case. She claimed that the four months of 2019 before her injury were worth more than the annual income estimate used for settlement discussions, noting that tax returns showed a loss from not working for the rest of the year. She asserted that Jason, described as an owner/operator truck driver involved in the case for over four years, had offered compensation that she viewed as inadequate. She claimed that Jason’s salary, described as specialized hazard pay for Kentucky, was stated as $84,000, but she contended that in reality he earned that amount by executing one contract per month. Amy then itemized several grounds for medical malpractice: failure to diagnose and prolonged treatment from the ER, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a possible failed spinal fusion. \n\nShe also criticized the negotiation process, noting that the defense’s lawyer would not revisit a higher offer, which she believed would concern licensing and insurance boards. As a side note about the scheduled Saturday appointment, she warned that if forecasted snow occurred, she would not attend due to safety concerns, describing it as PTSD or anxiety and expressing a need to protect her safety and reduce risk of future harm. She concluded by saying she would keep Whaley posted.\n\nFollowing this, Whaley sent subsequent inquiries. On January 11, 2024, he asked Amy whether she had been able to obtain the MRI on January 6. Then, on January 16, 2024, he again checked in, asking if she had managed to get the MRI.\n\nAcross these exchanges, the thread repeatedly highlighted the central issues: Dr. Huff’s meeting and the referral to Dr. Hunt for neck evaluation, the necessity of a new cervical MRI before any further treatment decisions, the consideration of pain management for headaches, the medical and economic arguments underpinning settlement positions, and the practical barriers to obtaining the MRI, including equipment downtime, scheduling backlogs, health concerns, and safety considerations for winter weather. The communications reflect an ongoing effort to obtain the MRI results and to move the case toward a resolution while addressing Amy Mills’s substantial medical and personal burdens.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nThis record comprises a chain of email communications between Amy Mills and Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm concerning medical evaluation after the Dr. Huff meeting, scheduling of an MRI and referral appointments, and related settlement and case issues, spanning from October 24, 2023 through January 18, 2024.\n\nIn late October 2023, Aaron Whaley sent a note following a meeting with Dr. Huff. Dr. Huff’s note stated that Amy Mills should be evaluated by Dr. Hunt for a neck assessment, and that she should obtain a new cervical MRI first. He also recommended that Amy see a pain-management specialist for her headaches. Aaron attached Dr. Huff’s note and asked Amy to confirm receipt and to proceed with the recommended steps. Amy later indicated she understood the plan and the references to the referral and MRI.\n\nOn November 28, 2023, Amy reported a delay in scheduling the MRI due to issues with the MRI machine being down and a backlog that would push December scheduling. She explained she had been dealing with a debilitating migraine and had not yet been able to respond fully, emphasizing the impact of the delays on moving the case forward. Aaron acknowledged the situation and encouraged Amy to let him know when she was rescheduled.\n\nThroughout December 2023, the exchange continued as scheduling remained uncertain. On December 5, 2023, Aaron asked Amy to inform him when the MRI could be rescheduled. On December 8, 2023, Amy replied that she would let him know. Aaron followed up again on December 29, 2023, asking whether the MRI had been rescheduled.\n\nIn early January 2024, the communications focused on whether the MRI had been rescheduled and the strategic importance of obtaining the MRI. On January 3, 2024, Aaron stressed that the MRI needed to be completed so the results could be forwarded to an expert to determine if a revision neck surgery might be necessary and to assess whether neck issues were contributing to Amy’s headaches. He also noted that delaying information would worsen the case if it went to trial and that advancing this information could help secure a better trial outcome.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Amy provided a detailed update reflecting the MRI scheduling status and a number of personal and case-related concerns. She stated the MRI was scheduled for Saturday, January 6, 2024, and expressed strong personal motivation to have the procedure done promptly due to ongoing pain and the desire to resolve the medical issues. She also described additional health challenges: a botched root canal with a filling that had failed, leaving her tooth exposed, with extraction not being an option because of her neck injury and related issues, thus requiring surgical removal. She criticized the insurance settlement offers as insulting, noting that four months of income in 2019 before the injury was at least twice the estimated annual income; tax returns corroborated the higher earnings prior to the injury, while the overall year was a loss due to not working. She contrasted Jason’s claimed salary for hazard-pay roles in Kentucky—citing an online figure of $84,000—with her understanding that he only performed one contract per month. She described medical-legal concerns including alleged medical malfeasance (failure to diagnose and prolonged ER treatment), a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a possible failed spinal fusion. She also criticized the opposing side’s attorney for not revising a higher offer, suggesting that such conduct could draw the attention of licensing and insurance boards. Finally, she noted a safety-related warning: if forecasted snow materialized, she would not attend the Saturday appointment due to safety concerns, labeling it as possibly PTSD or anxiety and stating she could not risk future harm. She pledged to keep Aaron updated.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, Aaron asked Amy whether she was able to obtain the MRI dated for January 6, to enable him to forward the results to an expert and to assess the need for potentially revising the surgery plan and evaluating whether the neck is contributing to headaches. He underscored the urgency given trial timelines.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Aaron again checked in, asking if Amy had been able to obtain the MRI.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Amy replied that she did obtain the MRI, and that the medical report should be in the possession of the involved parties by now. She explained that due to snow and ice, she had not yet scheduled the referral appointment, but she had a direct contact with whom she had been dealing on the matter.\n\nThat same day, Aaron responded, “Great! Let me know when it gets scheduled,” indicating continued coordination on the referral and next steps.\n\nIn summary, this record documents: (1) Dr. Huff’s note recommending a neck evaluation by Dr. Hunt and a new cervical MRI, plus pain-management for headaches; (2) ongoing MRI scheduling delays and weather-related postponements from late 2023 into January 2024; (3) a detailed January 4, 2024 email from Amy describing health issues (botched root canal with exposed tooth requiring possible surgical removal due to neck injury), the controversial settlement offers and income history, alleged medical malfeasance (ER treatment failures, TBI, possible failed spinal fusion), and safety concerns about travel due to weather; (4) multiple efforts by Aaron Whaley to obtain MRI results and push for a timely medical-and-legal evaluation; and (5) the MRI ultimately taking place on January 6, 2024, with the report to follow, though referral scheduling remained pending due to weather.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills (Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019). Client: Amy Mills.\n\nThis narrative summarizes the medical-legal communications between Amy Mills and attorney Aaron Whaley regarding Dr. Huff’s meeting, referrals, and MRI scheduling from October 2023 through January 2024. In late October 2023, after a meeting with Dr. Huff, Whaley informed Mills that Dr. Huff had referred her to Dr. Hunt for a neck evaluation and that she needed a new cervical MRI first. Dr. Huff also recommended that Mills see someone for pain management for her headaches, and Whaley advised her to call and follow up with the referral.\n\nOver the following months, the scheduling of the MRI and related appointments became a recurring topic. On November 10, 2023, Whaley checked in with Mills to see if she had been able to obtain the MRI. By November 28, Mills replied that the MRI machine had been down and there was a backlog; she had also been bedridden for over a week with a terrible debilitating migraine, which contributed to delays in responding. On December 5, 2023, Whaley expressed sympathy for her situation and asked to be informed when she was rescheduled. Mills responded on December 8, 2023, that she would let him know. On December 29, 2023, Whaley followed up again, asking if the MRI had been rescheduled.\n\nIn early January 2024, Whaley pressed for progress, noting that the MRI needed to be completed so he could forward the results to an expert to determine whether a revision surgery might be required and to assess whether the neck could be contributing to her headaches. He stressed that the longer they waited, the worse the situation could be for trial purposes, and that obtaining the information was necessary to reach the numbers Mills desired in the case.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Mills replied that she had been called the previous day to schedule the MRI and that it was scheduled for Saturday, January 6, 2024. She emphasized her strong desire to have the MRI done, noting she has been in great pain from the injury and cannot rush the process without harming herself; she added that there hadn’t been a Christmas for her kids because of these issues. Mills also described a dental issue: a botched root canal in which the filling has completely given way, leaving the tooth exposed, and she stated that extraction is not an option due to her neck injury, so the tooth would need to be surgically removed. She criticized the settlement offer being offered, arguing that the 4 months of 2019 before her injury were twice as much (plus) as the annual income estimate; she cited tax returns showing this, but noted that the year was still a loss because she could not work for the remainder of the year. She also alleged medical malpractice, referencing a failure to diagnose and prolonged ER treatment, a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a possible failed spinal fusion. Regarding the negotiations, she stated that the defense’s lawyer would not go back with a higher offer, which she believed would be disapproved by licensing and insurance boards. She added a side note that if forecasted snow appeared, she might not attend the scheduled appointment due to safety concerns, describing it as PTSD or anxiety and stating she could not risk further harm. Mills concluded by promising to keep Whaley posted.\n\nSubsequent messages show ongoing inquiry about the MRI’s progress. On January 11, 2024, Whaley asked whether the MRI had been completed on January 6. He reiterated the importance of the MRI for moving forward with expert review and trial strategy. On January 16, 2024, he again asked Mills whether she had been able to obtain the MRI. On January 18, 2024, Mills replied that she believed the MRI had occurred and that the MRI report should be available by now, but because of weather (snow and ice), she had not scheduled the referral appointment yet; she also noted that she had a direct contact she had been dealing with regarding the matter. Finally, on January 31, 2024, Whaley followed up with the question: Did your doctor visit get rescheduled?",

      "natural_language": "This narrative consolidates the email communications in the Amy Mills case, focusing on the Dr. Huff meeting, referrals, MRI scheduling, and related medical-legal strategy, from October 24, 2023 through February 5, 2024.\n\nOn October 24, 2023, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm reported that he had just met with Dr. Huff and attached the note from that meeting. Dr. Huff referred Amy to Dr. Hunt, another doctor at the same clinic, for a neck evaluation. He instructed Amy to obtain a new cervical MRI first and to follow up with that appointment. Dr. Huff also recommended that Amy pursue pain management for her headaches.\n\nIn late November 2023, Amy Mills reported delays affecting the MRI process. She explained that the MRI machine was down and would need to be fixed, with additional rescheduling expected due to the backlog of MRI orders. She also noted that she had been in bed with a debilitating migraine. Aaron Whaley acknowledged the situation in early December, expressing sympathy and asking Amy to let him know when she was rescheduled.\n\nThroughout December 2023, and into January 2024, the thread continued with follow-up about MRI scheduling. On December 29, 2023, Aaron asked whether the MRI had been rescheduled. On January 3, 2024, he emphasized the need for the MRI to be done so he could forward the information to an expert to assess whether Amy might need a revision surgery and to determine whether the neck could be contributing to her headaches. He noted that delaying further could worsen the situation at trial and stressed the goal of obtaining information to present a stronger position to the defense. He also indicated that the longer the delay, the harder it would be to reach favorable trial numbers.\n\nOn January 4, 2024, Amy replied that the MRI was scheduled for Saturday, January 6, 2024. She expressed strong desire to have the MRI done and described the ongoing suffering from the injury. She also provided context about other health and financial stresses: a botched root canal, with the filling having deteriorated and the tooth exposed, and the unsuitability of extraction due to her neck injury, implying the tooth would need surgical removal. She commented on the financial aspect of the case, noting that four months of 2019 before the injury were worth more than the annual income estimate, and that tax returns reflected this despite a loss from not working the rest of the year. She mentioned that her husband Jason had already made an offer and, in her view, more than that as a long-standing owner/operator truck driver. She contrasted his claimed Kentucky hazard-pay salary of $84,000 with her perception that his actual work involves approximately one contract per month. She described the medical-legal issues as including medical malpractice for the failure to diagnose and prolonged treatment from the initial ER visit, a traumatic brain injury (TBI), and a possible failed spinal fusion. She also noted that, during back-and-forth negotiations, the defense’s attorney would not come back with a higher offer, which she suspected would concern licensing and insurance boards.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, Aaron Whaley followed up to ask whether Amy was able to obtain the MRI on January 6. He reiterated the importance of having the MRI results for expert review and potential revision surgery considerations, as well as to inform the treatment plan for headaches and the overall case numbers for trial.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Aaron again checked in, asking if Amy had been able to get the MRI.\n\nOn January 18, 2024, Amy responded that she did indeed obtain the MRI. She stated that the medical report should be available by now. However, due to weather conditions involving snow and ice, she had not yet scheduled the referral appointment. She noted that she had a direct contact she was dealing with regarding that referral as well.\n\nOn January 31, 2024, Aaron asked Amy whether her doctor visit had been rescheduled.\n\nFinally, on February 5, 2024, Aaron followed up once more, asking Amy to confirm whether the doctor visit had been rescheduled, indicating that this remains a current issue in the case.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn February 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm emailed Anna Mercer, the clinical assistant to Dr. Wallace Huff at Bluegrass Orthopaedics, and Amy Mills regarding Amy Mills. He noted that Dr. Huff had referred Mrs. Mills to another doctor at Bluegrass Orthopaedics to evaluate her neck and asked Anna if she knew who that doctor was, and whether that doctor had someone as helpful as Anna whom he could contact.\n\nThe email thread from October 2023 shows ongoing coordination about Dr. Huff’s involvement. On October 24, 2023, Anna Mercer indicated she was sending “the note Dr. Huff dictated today.” Earlier in the day, Aaron Whaley had provided a phone number: 502-357-5048. Earlier still, Anna asked which phone number she should have Dr. Huff call.\n\nThe thread also records several scheduling and billing details. On October 16, 2023, Anna stated that Dr. Huff could do a telephone conference on 10/24/2023 at 3:45 PM or 10/31/2023 at 3:30 PM, and she requested a fax number to send the invoice, noting that payment would need to be received 48 business hours before the conference to avoid cancellation or postponement. Aaron confirmed that 10/24/23 worked for him. Earlier that same day, Anna listed the two available dates for the conference (10/24/2023 at 3:45 PM and 10/31/2023 at 3:30 PM) and offered to send the invoice once a date was chosen. Aaron responded affirmatively that 10/24/23 would work.\n\nOn October 16 and 17, 2023 there were continued exchanges about logistics and payment. Aaron provided a contact number of 502-357-9939, and Anna explained the conference arrangements and the 30-minute block rate of $1,000 for a telephone conference with Dr. Huff. There are also notes indicating the invoice was faxed and that a check had been issued, with subsequent confirmations that the check had gone out. Anna’s responses repeatedly referenced the schedule and the invoice process, and Aaron’s replies confirmed acceptance of the proposed arrangements.\n\nThe email chain includes the usual signatures and contact details for the parties. Anna Mercer is identified as the Clinical Assistant to Dr. Wallace Huff at Bluegrass Orthopaedics, located at 3401 Yorkshire Medical Park, Lexington, KY 40509, with a phone number of (859) 263-5140 Ext. 226 and a corresponding website. The signatures also contain standard confidentiality notices consistent with the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and the messages reference typical disclaimers about privileged and confidential information and the proper handling of misdirected messages. The Whaley Law Firm signatures repeatedly appear with their Louisville, Kentucky address and phone number as well.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nOn February 14, 2024, a forward of Amy Mills’ file was sent by Aaron Whaley to Amy Mills’ address. The message includes a note from Anna Mercer stating that Dr. Huff referred Amy Mills to Dr. Hunt for evaluation, but the appointment was canceled because Amy Mills canceled her MRI at Lexington Diagnostics. Anna notes that Dr. Hunt’s assistant is Kristen Cox and that her extension is 364.\n\nIn a separate thread within the same forward, dated February 14, 2024 at 1:11 PM, Aaron Whaley asked Anna Mercer if she could identify which doctor at Bluegrass Orthopaedics had been referred to for a neck evaluation and whether that doctor had an assistant as helpful as Anna, so he could reach out if needed. Anna had previously sent a note on October 24, 2023, indicating “Here is the note Dr. Huff dictated today,” which suggests Dr. Huff’s referral and related details were being circulated to the parties.\n\nThe October 2023 portion of the chain shows additional context about coordinating Dr. Huff’s involvement. Communication on October 24, 2023 included notes of a telephone conference for Dr. Huff and related scheduling details. The thread shows a contact number used in these communications: 502-357-5048. Earlier exchanges on October 16, 2023 included the number 502-357-9939, and discussions about which phone number Dr. Huff should call. There were arrangements for a telephone conference with Dr. Huff, typically conducted on Tuesday afternoons, at a rate of $1,000 per 30 minutes. Dr. Huff offered two possible times for the conference: October 24, 2023 at 3:45 PM or October 31, 2023 at 3:30 PM, with Dr. Huff’s assistant and scheduling details handled through Anna Mercer, Clinical Assistant to Dr. Wallace Huff of Bluegrass Orthopaedics.\n\nThe correspondence also covered logistical and billing aspects. Anna asked for a fax number to send an invoice and stated that payment would need to be received 48 business hours before the conference to prevent cancellation or postponement. Several notes reference the invoicing process, including mentions of sending the invoice and a subsequent payment note that the check had gone out. Specific contact and billing details appear in the thread, including a telephone number for inquiries (502-357-9939) and a fax line (the exact fax number appears in the exchange as part of the invoicing discussion). The chain includes the standard confidentiality notices typical of these professional communications, with signatures for Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022) and for Anna Mercer of Bluegrass Orthopaedics (3401 Yorkshire Medical Park, Lexington, KY 40509, 859-263-5140 Ext. 226).\n\nIn summary, the notes reflect: Dr. Huff referred Amy Mills to Dr. Hunt (Dr. Hunt’s assistant is Kristen Cox, extension 364) for neck evaluation, but the appointment was canceled due to Amy Mills canceling her MRI at Lexington Diagnostics. The broader thread documents prior efforts to identify the referred Bluegrass Orthopaedics physician, coordinate a Dr. Huff teleconference (usually on Tuesdays) at a cost of $1,000 per 30 minutes, and manage the associated invoicing and payment timeline, including specific phone and fax numbers and the parties’ contact details.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn January 2024, the record shows an ongoing correspondence between attorney Betsy Catron of WHT Law and Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm regarding Amy Mills. On January 12, 2024 at 12:00 PM, Betsy Catron wrote to Aaron inquiring about obtaining all of Ms. Mills’ records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros. She asked whether Ms. Mills had presented to the Nashville clinic to which she was referred and requested details about that provider. Betsy noted that the Bluegrass Ortho record referred to Dr. Paul McCombs in Nashville; however, she understood that Dr. McCombs is now retired and that he was previously affiliated with the Howell Allen clinic. Betsy asked for confirmation of provider details and for any additional records.\n\nThat same day, January 12, 2024 at 12:04 PM, Aaron Whaley replied to Betsy. He explained that the doctor Dr. Huff had wanted Amy Mills to see was Dr. Paul McCombs, but Dr. McCombs is retired. Dr. Huff had referred Amy to a spine orthopedic surgeon within Bluegrass Orthopaedics. Aaron added that Amy had undergone an updated MRI on January 6 and that they were waiting for the results.\n\nEarlier, on January 12, 2024, Betsy Catron had already sent the initial inquiry regarding records and the Nashville referral. The thread shows Betsy’s concern about sourcing records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros, and her request for information about the January 6 MRI results.\n\nMoving forward to March 2024, the activity continues. On March 1, 2024 at 7:43 AM, Betsy sent another message reiterating that they were having difficulty obtaining records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros. She asked whether Aaron had any updated records he could provide and whether there was any further information following the January 6 MRI.\n\nLater that same day, at 11:35 AM, Aaron responded to Betsy. He stated that Amy Mills could not attend the previously scheduled appointment due to a severe snowstorm. He noted that Amy is currently scheduled for an appointment on March 11. The exchange confirms that the schedule adjustment was weather-related and that plans were set for a later date.",

Betsy reported that the team was having difficulty obtaining records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros and asked Aaron whether he had any updated records he could share.

He explained that the doctor Dr. Huff wanted Amy Mills to see was Dr. McCombs, but Dr. McCombs is retired. Dr. Huff then referred Amy to a spine orthopedic specialist within Bluegrass Orthopaedics. He also noted that Amy had an updated MRI on January 6 and that the results were still pending.\n\nIn Betsy’s January 12, 2024 reply (time approximately noon), she asked for a status update on the case. She inquired whether Amy Mills had presented to the Nashville clinic to which she was referred and, if so, requested details about the provider. Betsy observed that the Bluegrass Orthopaedics record referenced Dr. Paul McCombs in Nashville; however, she noted that Dr. McCombs is now retired. She added that he had previously been associated with the Howell Allen clinic. Betsy’s message indicated that they were continuing to gather all of Ms. Mills’ records from Bluegrass Orthopaedics and PT Pros and sought information regarding the Nashville referral provider.\n\nThe March 1, 2024 note concludes with Betsy’s signature and the law firm’s standard contact information.

On Friday, March 1, 2024, at 11:35:24 AM, in an email from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) to Betsy R. Catron of Vine Center (betsy.catron@whtlaw.com), with copies to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com) and Amy Mills (amymillspremisez995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), Aaron stated that Amy Mills could not attend the previously scheduled appointment due to one of the bad snowstorms and that she is currently scheduled for March 11.\n\nEarlier that day, at 7:43 AM (time shown as 7:43?AM in the record), Betsy Catron replied, explaining that they were having difficulty obtaining records from Bluegrass Orthopaedics (Ortho) and PT Pros, and asking Aaron for any updated records he could provide, as well as any further information following the January 6 MRI.\n\nLooking back to January, 2024, the thread shows that on Friday, January 12, 2024 at 12:04 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Betsy Catron (cc’d to Sarena Tuttle and Amy Mills) confirming that the doctor Dr. Huff had wanted Amy to see was Dr. McCombs, but Dr. McCombs is retired. Dr. Huff then referred Amy to a spine orthopedic provider within Bluegrass Orthopaedics. Aaron noted that Amy had an updated MRI on January 6 and that they were waiting on the results.\n\nAlso on January 12, 2024, at 12:00 PM (time noted as 12:00?PM in the record), Betsy Catron wrote again, stating that they were still working on obtaining all of Ms. Mills’ records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros. Betsy asked whether Amy had presented to the Nashville clinic referenced by Bluegrass Ortho, and if so, for details of the provider. The Bluegrass Ortho record referred to Dr. Paul McCombs in Nashville, though it appeared that he is now retired; she noted that he had previously been associated with the Howell Allen clinic.\n\nBetsy’s signature block then followed, listing her as Attorney at Vine Center, with the address 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, and contact information: P 859.422.6000, F 859.422.6001, www.whtlaw.com.\n\nThe thread also includes Aaron’s closing signature, showing his information as part of the Whaley Law Firm: 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022, and a standard external email caution notice.\n\nIn summary, the communications between January and March 2024 revolved around locating and obtaining Amy Mills’ medical records from Bluegrass Ortho and PT Pros, confirming which physician Amy was referred to (initially Dr. McCombs, who is retired), noting a January 6 MRI with results still pending, and coordinating scheduling after a snowstorm prevented an earlier appointment, with Amy now scheduled for March 11.",

      "natural_language": "This narrative summarizes the email communications in the Amy Mills case (Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019) regarding MRI and orthopedic follow-up, as documented by The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nOn March 12, 2024, Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email about the MRI and ortho follow-up. The subject was Re: MRI and Ortho Follow up. In the body of the message, she noted that a task had been set to order the MRI that day, and she had called Nicole (HIM) to request that the MRI report be faxed. She also stated that she sent a CRR via fax, and that confirmation had been received, with the matter now being that the practice is awaiting records and bills. The email was directed to Aaron Whaley, with Amy Mills CC’d, and included Sarena’s signature block with her title and contact information, along with a note to please note the new email address. The message included The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY, and listed direct line and main office numbers.\n\nThe record also captures prior correspondence in the chain. On February 14, 2024, at approximately 1:13 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Amy Mills, checking in to see whether she had been able to obtain the MRI results and whether she had recently seen the orthopedic specialist or had a scheduled appointment. He closed with thanks.\n\nLater, on March 9, 2024, at approximately 1:43 PM, Aaron Whaley again wrote, stating simply, “Need this MRI report ASAP.”\n\nAlso on March 9, 2024, in a forwarded message from Amy Mills dated around 1:25 PM, she replied to Aaron Whaley: “Hello, Yes I did, I had sent an email on this a few times actually. I will be going to a specialist on Monday. I will keep you updated. Thanks, AM.” This indicates that Amy had previously sent multiple emails on the MRI/report issue and that she anticipated a specialist appointment on the following Monday, with a commitment to provide updates.\n\nIn summary, the March 12, 2024 note confirms that the team had requested the MRI report be faxed, had arranged for related records (CRR) to be faxed, and were awaiting the associated records and bills, while the February and March exchanges show ongoing client inquiries about MRI results and orthopedic follow-up, and Amy Mills’ confirmation of a pending specialist visit and ongoing updates.",

The message explains that Amy Mills saw a doctor on Monday—Dr. Hunt, who is in the same practice as Dr. Huff. Dr. Huff is described as a shoulder doctor who had previously said that Amy’s problems originated from her neck, which would make Dr. Hunt a neck doctor. However, Dr. Hunt, who had just seen Amy, now says that the issue is not in the neck but in the shoulder. Because of this discrepancy, the note states that they need the record from the most recent visit, and once that record is obtained, they probably need to send something to the assistant they’ve been dealing with over at Bluegrass Orthopedics to figure out which doctor is addressing the shoulder or neck.\n\nThe note concludes with Whaley’s contact information and firm details: Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022.",

      "natural_language": "On March 15, 2024, in a message titled “Re: Amy Mills,” Sarena M. Tuttle, a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, reported continuing efforts to obtain records for Amy Mills. She stated that she had sent CRR on Tuesday and had called the Facility and LVM for the Records Clerk, Nicole. She noted that she called the Facility again that day and LVM again for Nicole. The recording she referenced indicated a 24–48 hour callback window and that RR takes 7–10 days. Based on the recording, she expected to have CMRs by the end of next week. She planned to call Nicole again before leaving that day and again on Monday if the records were not received. The message included her signature block with her contact information: Sarena M.

Dr. Huff is described as a shoulder doctor, and he had stated that Amy’s problems are from her neck. Dr. Hunt, who had just seen her, said the issue is neck-related, and yet Whaley notes that Dr. Hunt says, “no, it’s your shoulder.” As a result, they need the record from Amy’s most recent visit, and once that record is obtained, they will likely send something to the assistant at Bluegrass Orthopedics to determine which clinician handles the shoulder versus the neck.",

      "natural_language": "This note documents a sequence of email communications about a new case for Amy Mills, filed under Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019.\n\nOn March 27, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, Kentucky, reached out to Kate Smith to inquire about having Dr. Orlando review one of his cases. He explained that Dr. Orlando comes highly recommended by his friend Robert Mattingly and described the matter as fairly complicated, asking what steps he needed to take to get the process started. The email was sent to Kate Smith (and included Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 in the cc line, along with Marc Orlando and Amy Mills’ filevine-associated contact) and carried Aaron’s signature detailing the Whaley Law Firm’s address and phone number.\n\nOn the same day, March 27, 2024 at 2:27 PM, Kate replied. She introduced herself as Kate Smith, a nurse and life care planner who works with Dr. Orlando and helps keep his schedule organized and records uploaded. She stated that they often handle catastrophic cases where an independent medical examination (IME) and a life care plan (LCP) are needed, and she noted that they work both jointly and individually. She attached their usual forms, including an introduction letter, CVs, fee schedules, and W-9s, and mentioned that she also had her own information attached. Kate provided her direct line (513) 312-1742 and her email address marcinckate@gmail.com. She also outlined availability for a phone call: March 28 anytime from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM, March 29 at 9:00 AM, April 1 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and April 2 from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. She emphasized that Dr. Orlando and she frequently work together on catastrophic cases and that they can work jointly or separately. The message included a standard notice indicating that the email and attachments may contain sensitive information intended only for the recipient.\n\nLater the same day, Aaron responded with appreciation but asked for further guidance, writing: “Kate, I am inquiring about getting one of my cases reviewed by Dr. Orlando. He comes highly recommended. Robert Mattingly is one of my good friends and he recommended Dr. Orlando. I have a pretty complicated case and want to know what I need to do to get the ball rolling. Thank you so much for your time.” His signature followed, listing his firm’s name and contact information.\n\nShortly after, on March 28, 2024 at 1:03 PM, Kate followed up to Aaron with a brief note: it had been great speaking with him earlier that day and that she had discussed the case with Dr. Orlando, but unfortunately, this is a case they would not be able to assist with. Aaron replied about five minutes later, asking, “Ok. Why?”\n\nThis chain of emails establishes that the matter originated as a new case for Amy Mills (Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019) and that Aaron Whaley sought Dr. Orlando’s review, a request ultimately declined by Kate after consultation with Dr. Orlando. The communications include the initial inquiry, the information about Dr. Orlando’s team and services, the attachments provided, the availability for a call, the standard notice about sensitive information, and the final determination that the case could not be accepted.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. The client involved is Amy Mills.\n\nThe record begins with a new-case inquiry. On March 27, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; phone 502-583-4022; agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com) reached out to Kate Smith (marcinckate@gmail.com) regarding a potential review by Dr. Orlando. He explained that Dr. Orlando comes highly recommended by a mutual contact, Robert Mattingly, and noted that the case is fairly complicated and he wanted to know what he needed to do to get things rolling. He also indicated that this inquiry related to a case involving Amy Mills.\n\nIn response, on March 27, 2024, Kate Smith introduced herself. She explained that she is a nurse and a life care planner who works with Dr. Orlando and helps manage his schedule, records, and related logistics. She stated that she and Dr. Orlando often collaborate on catastrophic cases requiring an IME (independent medical examination) and an LCP (life care plan), though they can work jointly or individually. She attached their standard materials, including an introduction letter, CVs, fee schedules, and W-9s, and noted that she also has her own information on file. She provided her contact details: direct line 513-312-1742 and email marcinckate@gmail.com, and offered to discuss the case further by phone. She listed available times for a call: March 28 anytime from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., March 29 at 9 a.m., April 1 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and April 2 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. She also included a notice stating that the message and attachments may contain sensitive information and are for the intended recipient.\n\nAlso on March 27, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied to Kate, asking for clarification. He stated that he was inquiring about having one of his cases reviewed by Dr. Orlando, noting that Dr. Orlando comes highly recommended and that Robert Mattingly—his good friend—had recommended Dr. Orlando. He described the case as pretty complicated and asked what he needed to do to get the ball rolling.\n\nOn March 27, 2024 at 2:27 p.m., Aaron sent a further message reinforcing his inquiry about Dr. Orlando and thanking Kate for her time.\n\nOn March 28, 2024 at 1:03 p.m., Kate replied that it had been great speaking with Aaron and that she had discussed the case with Dr. Orlando; unfortunately, they would not be able to assist with the case.\n\nAt 1:06 p.m. on March 28, Aaron asked, “Ok. Why?”\n\nThen at 1:16 p.m., Kate responded that, due to their current busy schedule, they have had to be more selective when accepting cases. She suggested that the case may be more appropriate for a neuro-headache specialist who can discern what are new migraine symptoms, specifically distinguishing those symptoms from a fall versus pre-existing conditions.\n\nFinally, at 1:26 p.m. on March 28, Aaron sent a closing reply: “Ok, thank you. You would not happen to have someone to refer in that area?”\n\nThis summarizes the sequence of outreach, responses, and referrals discussed in the correspondence regarding the Amy Mills Premise case.",

      "natural_language": "In the case file for Amy Mills, titled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019, the client is Amy Mills. The communications center on gathering and updating medical records from Bluegrass Orthopedics, PSC, and on tracking appointments related to her care.\n\nOn April 3, 2024, at 11:02:32 a.m. (04:00 offset -0400), Sarena M. Tuttle, the Whaley Law Firm’s litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager, wrote to Betsy R. Catron with the subject FW: Amy Mills. She advised that she was attaching the most recent records received from Bluegrass Orthopedics, PSC and invited Betsy to contact her directly if anything further was needed to discuss the matter in detail. Tuttle noted her new email address and provided her contact information: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line (502) 357-9971; office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier, on April 2, 2024, at 10:31?PM, Aaron Whaley of The Whaley Law Firm forwarded a message. The forwarded content shows Whaley’s firm details (712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222; 502-583-4022) and a note indicating a forwarding of prior correspondence without substantive changes to the case record at that time.\n\nThe forwarded message originated from Betsy Catron, dated April 2, 2024 at 4:11?PM, addressed to Aaron Whaley with the subject FW: Amy Mills. Betsy stated that attached were records from Bluegrass Ortho for Amy Mills and asked whether there was anything from 2024 or an update on Amy’s March appointment.\n\nBefore this, Betsy had emailed on March 1, 2024 at 12:07 PM, sending a reply to Aaron with a brief “RE: Amy Mills” and simply “Ok, thanks.”\n\nPrior to that, Aaron Whaley had replied on March 1, 2024 at 11:35 AM to Betsy. His message explained that Amy could not make the appointment during a snowstorm, and that she was currently rescheduled for March 11.\n\nOn March 1, 2024, at 7:43?AM, Betsy had written to Aaron asking for updates. She noted that there was difficulty obtaining records from Bluegrass Orthopedics and PT Pros and requested any updated records as well as information following the January 6 MRI.\n\nThe chain also contains prior correspondence from January 12, 2024. At 12:04 PM, Aaron Whaley wrote to Betsy (Cc’d to Sarena Tuttle and Amy Mills). He stated that the doctor Dr. Huff wanted Amy to see was Dr. McCombs; however, Dr. McCombs is retired. Dr. Huff referred Amy to a spine orthopedic specialist within Bluegrass Orthopedics. He also noted that Amy had an updated MRI on January 6 and that the results were pending.\n\nEarlier that same day, January 12, 2024 at 12:00 PM, Betsy had written: she was trying to obtain all of Ms. Mills’ records from Bluegrass Orthopedics and PT Pros and asked whether Amy Mills had presented to the Nashville clinic she was referred to; if so, Betsy requested details of the provider. Betsy noted that Bluegrass Orthopedics’ record referred to Dr. Paul McCombs in Nashville, but that he is apparently retired, having previously been associated with Howell Allen clinic.\n\nThe thread includes the signatures and contact details of the participants. Betsy Catron’s signature lists Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with phone and fax numbers (P) 859.422.6000 and (F) 859.422.6001, and the website www.whtlaw.com. Aaron Whaley’s signature lists Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone 502-583-4022 and a standard external email caution. Sarena Tuttle’s signature lists her role at The Whaley Law Firm and provides her contact information, including the note “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS” for Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. The communications reference the new email address for Sarena and include the firm’s Louisville address and phone numbers.\n\nTogether, the exchanges reflect ongoing efforts to obtain 2024 records, confirm the status of Amy Mills’s March appointment, and clarify details regarding the referred Nashville provider and the January 6 MRI results, with the latest update being that the most recent records from Bluegrass Orthopedics were attached to the April 3, 2024 email from Sarena Tuttle.",

I have a case that I need some work on. I\nam thinking I need a narrative of what injuries are related to a fall as\nwell as an IME. Probably need a life plan from there. Client slipped and\nfell on a marble floor at a bank. She was in her late 30's at the time.\nSince the fall in 2019 she has had a cervical fusion, shoulder labral\nrepair, migraine headaches and still has shoulder/neck pain. Current\ntreaters at Bluegrass Ortho have gone back and forth between whether it is\nher shoulder or neck. I have records as well as timelines I have created. I\ncan send records already separated by date or just all together. Whatever\nis easiest for you.

This matter concerns expert services in connection with a fall and related medical evaluations.\n\nIn August 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm reached out regarding a case requiring expert work. In an email sent on August 5, 2024 at 11:02:40 a.m. Eastern Time, addressed to Kathleen Johnson of PMR Life Care Plans, along with Amy Mills Premise and others, Aaron explained that he needed a narrative tying injuries to a fall and an independent medical examination (IME), followed by a life care plan. He described the incident as the client slipping and falling on a marble floor at a bank, noting she was in her late 30s at the time. Since the 2019 fall, she has undergone a cervical fusion and a shoulder labral repair, suffers migraine headaches, and continues to experience shoulder and neck pain. Her current treating physicians at Bluegrass Orthopaedics have vacillated between shoulder- versus neck-related causes. Aaron stated that he has records and timelines prepared and could provide records either organized by date or in total, depending on what is easiest for the recipient.\n\nEarlier, on Friday, July 26, 2024 at approximately 1:20 p.m., Aaron Whaley sent an initial inquiry to pmrlifecareplans@gmail.com. He explained that he had obtained the contact information from Seth Gladstein, who spoke highly of their services, and asked for a list of all the services and doctors available, including good medical reviews, narratives, IME reports, life care plans, and related offerings.\n\nOn Saturday, July 27, 2024 at about 10:03 a.m. (time approximate in the record), Kathleen Johnson replied to Aaron. She opened with a warm greeting, noting that it had been a while since they last connected. She attached PMR Life Care Plans, LLC’s current team overview and fee schedule. She announced that in September they would be adding six pediatric PM&R life care planners from Gillette Children’s and Vanderbilt University, as well as four additional adult PM&R physicians from Vanderbilt and the University of Kentucky (UK). She offered to discuss the arrangement in more detail by phone or coffee, noting availability on Monday and Tuesday of the following week.\n\nJohnson described PMR Life Care Plans, LLC as a national provider offering forensic consultation, expert medical opinions, and life care planning services, supported by a team of renowned, board-certified adult and pediatric physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians, orthopedic surgeons, and neurologists. She stated that this group comprises academic leaders, researchers, and practicing clinicians whose primary mission is advancing medical knowledge and patient care, with their forensic work grounded in academic rigor. She explained that PMR’s mission-driven approach underpins their damages valuation services, including impartial assessments of future medical care, loss of earnings capacity, and loss of household services for individuals affected by chronic or catastrophic injuries. Johnson emphasized the commitment to impartiality and professionalism, asserting that their evaluations are trusted, credible, and unbiased. She claimed that PMR not only sets the standard for medical expert consultation but also embodies a mission-driven service essential to the advancement and just resolution of complex litigation cases.\n\nJohnson signed as Kathleen Gormley Johnson, Owner/Chief Strategist/Chief Operations of PMR Life Care Plans, LLC, located at 37 River Hill Rd, Louisville, KY 40207. Her contact details were listed as KathleenJohnson@pmrlifecareplans.com, with the website www.pmrlifecareplans.com, business phone 502-530-6265, and mobile 859-750-2678. The message included a confidentiality disclaimer noting that it may contain privileged information or work product and advising that unintended recipients should notify the sender and delete the message and any attachments.\n\nThe thread also contains an earlier message from Aaron Whaley, dated Friday, July 26, 2024, to pmrlifecareplans@gmail.com, reiterating his request for information about services and doctors after a referral from Seth Gladstein, and closing with his signature and firm contact details (Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022).",

      "natural_language": "In late July and early August 2024, the Whaley Law Firm began coordinating with PMR Life Care Plans to obtain expert services for a case involving Amy Mills, labeled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. The client, Amy Mills, slipped and fell on a marble bank floor in 2019. In the course of the case, Aaron Whaley sought a narrative linking injuries to the fall, an independent medical examination (IME), and likely a life-care plan to support damages valuation.\n\nThe outreach began with Aaron Whaley’s email dated July 26, 2024. He explained that he had learned of PMR Life Care Plans through Seth Gladstein and was seeking a full suite of expert services, including medical reviews, narratives, IMEs, and life-care planning. He noted that the client’s fall occurred in 2019, and that since then she has undergone a cervical fusion and a shoulder labral repair, experienced migraine headaches, and continued to have shoulder and neck pain. He described the treating physicians at Bluegrass Orthopaedics as alternating between attributing her symptoms to the shoulder or to the neck, with the latest assessment indicating the problem might originate from the neck. He stated that he had records and timelines available and asked whether PMR preferred records organized by date or all at once.\n\nKathleen Johnson of PMR Life Care Plans responded on July 27, 2024. She attached PMR’s current team overview and fee schedule and noted upcoming expansions: in September, PMR planned to add six pediatric PM&R life care planners from Gillette Children’s and Vanderbilt University, and four additional adult PM&R physicians from Vanderbilt and UK. She proposed a meet-and-greet via Zoom with Aaron and a few of the doctors to determine the best fit for the project. Johnson asked for Aaron’s project timeline and inquired whether Mills had been treated at UofL or Frazier, and who the treating physicians were that were debating whether the issue was neck or shoulder, as this information could assist the physicians in determining the best approach.\n\nEarlier that same week, on August 5, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent another email to Kathleen Johnson and Amy Mills, reiterating the request. He explained that the case had been quiet for some time and needed to move forward. He described the client as having fallen on a marble bank floor and, at the time, being in her late 30s. Since the 2019 fall, she had undergone a cervical fusion, a shoulder labral repair, and experienced migraine headaches, with ongoing shoulder and neck pain. He reaffirmed that the current treaters at Bluegrass Orthopaedics had vacillated between shoulder and neck as the source of the pain. He stated that he could provide records already sorted by date or in a single bundle, depending on what was easiest for PMR, and that he could send timelines and materials as needed.\n\nIn response, also on August 5, 2024, Kathleen Johnson proposed potential physicians for the project. She suggested Dr. Hockenbury, Dr. Carrasquer, Dr. Chen, or Dr. Wagers as possible experts and expressed a desire to arrange a meet-and-greet Zoom with Aaron and a couple of them to determine the best person for the project. She asked for the project timeline and again inquired about Mills’ treating facilities (UofL or Frazier) and the identifying of treating physicians who were debating whether the neck or the shoulder was the source of the problems, noting that this information would assist the physicians in determining the best approach.\n\nShortly after, Aaron Whaley sent a follow-up email on August 5, 2024, at approximately 11:03 a.m., addressing Kathleen and Amy Mills. He recalled that the case had been quiet for a while and reiterated the needs: a narrative identifying which injuries were related to the fall, an IME, and likely a life plan. He restated the core facts: Amy Mills slipped and fell on a marble bank floor in 2019 when she was in her late 30s; since the fall she had a cervical fusion, a shoulder labral repair, and migraine headaches, with persistent shoulder and neck pain. He again noted that the treating physicians at Bluegrass Orthopaedics had given differing opinions on whether the symptoms were shoulder- or neck-related and indicated he could provide records either by date or in one complete bundle.\n\nIn the original thread dating from July 26, 2024, Aaron had reached out to PMR Life Care Plans seeking a comprehensive list of services and available doctors, asking for examples of the work they could provide (reviews, narratives, IMEs, life-care plans, etc.). Kathleen’s July 27 follow-up included a detailed overview of PMR’s team and outlined upcoming expansions and the firm’s mission to provide impartial, academically grounded forensic consultation and life-care planning for litigation.\n\nTogether, the exchanges establish a sequence of outreach and coordination intended to secure PMR Life Care Plans’ expert services for Amy Mills’ case. The team would, if engaged, deliver a narrative linking the fall to Mills’ injuries, conduct an IME, and develop a life-care plan, with consideration given to which doctors should be involved and where Mills was treated, and with the aim of moving the case forward as the parties align on the proper medical source of Mills’ current symptoms.",

He stated that he did not yet have those records.\n\nEarlier still, at 11:17 a.m., Betsy Catron had written that written discovery had been served on August 2, 2024, but no responses had been received, and she reiterated the need for a timely update to avoid court intervention. She requested information on her client’s treatment and, if treatment had taken place, asked for the records as soon as possible.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy followed up again, asking whether there were any new records for Amy Mills and for an update on her treatment status.\n\nFinally, on October 21, 2024 at 11:08:38 a.m. (Eastern Time), Aaron Whaley sent a further update. He stated that he did not have new records at that moment, but that Amy Mills had recently undergone a new MRI of her shoulder, which showed a new tear of the labrum located at the suture from her previous surgery. He added that she is currently in physical therapy again. The message was sent to Betsy Catron, with CCs to Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com and stuttle.wlf@gmail.com) and Gregg Thornton (GThornton@whtlaw.com).\n\nThroughout the exchange, the parties’ communications circulated among the Whaley Law Firm and the WHT Law Firm, with the subject line Re: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, and the email header identifying Aaron Whaley as the sender and Betsy Catron as the recipient, along with the CC list. The correspondence includes standard firm signatures and disclaimers typical of external email, noting the offices and contact details for Betsy Catron and the Whaley Law Firm.",

This note documents a chain of communications regarding discovery and treatment records in the Amy Mills v Forcht Bank matter.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, at 12:19:06 GMT-05:00, Betsy Catron of Vine Center in Lexington, KY received an email from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm concerning Amy Mills. In that message, Aaron stated that after speaking with Amy, they could provide Betsy with all the information and responses to her interrogatories and requests for production. This included identifying who Amy is treating with after January 3. January 3 was noted as the date of Amy’s upcoming shoulder surgery, and Amy wished to wait to reveal the doctor’s identity until after the surgery. Aaron explained that the doctor had said he would not take Amy as a patient if she were in litigation, and Amy did not want the surgery canceled.\n\nThis December 12 email followed a prior thread, beginning with Betsy’s question on November 26, 2024 at 2:11? PM asking who Amy’s providers for physical therapy were and who would perform the surgery. In Aaron Whaley’s reply, sent that same day at 8:48 AM, he explained that he did not know those providers. He did, however, confirm that Amy had completed physical therapy and that she was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3.\n\nEarlier in the chain, on November 25, 2024 at 11:06? AM, Betsy had written requesting updated records and asking for the names of Amy’s current treating providers so those records could be requested.\n\nPrior to that, on October 21, 2024 at 11:09 AM, Aaron wrote that he did not know the PT providers but noted that Amy had a new MRI of her shoulder showing a new labral tear at the suture from her previous surgery and that she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy had asked Aaron to check for any new records for Amy and to update her on treatment status.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Betsy inquired about treatment and records, and Aaron responded at 11:18 AM that he was working on it and that Amy had a new MRI on September 11, with the records not yet in hand. Earlier that same day, Betsy had noted that written discovery had been served on August 2, 2024, but no response had been received; she cautioned that the discovery was past due and requested within a week an expectation for responses, along with an update on Amy’s treatment and any available records.\n\nThroughout these communications, the email chain included various recipients and CCs, such as Sarena Tuttle and Gregg Thornton, and a Filevine project email address associated with Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019, as reflected in the CC line of the December 12, 2024 message. The correspondence circulated among counsel concerning the handling of interrogatories, production requests, treatment records, and the forthcoming disclosure of Amy’s treating physician, to be disclosed after her January 3 shoulder surgery, due to litigation considerations.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, file noted as Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019, with Client: Amy Mills.\n\nIn a December 12, 2024 email chain regarding the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank matter, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm asked Gregg Thornton of WHT Law whether Thornton was asserting a right to dictate when Amy Mills can receive medical care ordered by her treating physician. The message opened with the question: “Gregg, are you asserting that you have the right to dictate when my client can receive medical care that has been ordered by her treating physician?”\n\nThornton replied later that day, stating that his firm could not agree to that position. He explained that Amy Mills is in litigation and that they need to evaluate the current films and records so their expert can determine whether anything else is needed before the surgery to address the incident can be opined as related. He added that waiting until after the surgery to hide the fact that she is in litigation from the surgeon is not something they could agree to.\n\nAlso on December 12, 2024, Aaron Whaley sent a separate message to Betsy Catron (with various others copied) indicating a willingness to provide complete responses to interrogatories and production requests. He stated that these would include information about who Amy Mills is treating with at that moment after January 3, which he identified as the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery. He noted that Amy would like to wait until after the surgery to reveal the identity of the treating doctor, explaining that the physician has said he will not take her as a patient if she is in litigation, and Amy does not want her surgery canceled.\n\nThe December 12 exchange followed a prior thread beginning in late November 2024. On November 26, Betsy Catron had asked who Amy Mills’ providers for physical therapy were and who would perform the shoulder surgery. Aaron Whaley responded that he could not provide the names of those providers at that time, but did confirm that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. Earlier in the month, on November 25, Betsy Catron had asked for any updated records and requested the identity of Amy’s current treatment providers so she could request those records. Whaley’s reply on that date did not provide the requested provider names but acknowledged the status of therapy and surgery plans.\n\nThis sequence followed prior communications dating back to October 2024. On October 21, 2024, Aaron Whaley indicated that he did not have new records to provide but knew that Amy had completed a new MRI on September 11 showing a new tear of her labrum located at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again. Betsy Catron had inquired on October 17, 2024 about any new records, and Aaron’s response highlighted the absence of new records at that time, while confirming the September 11 MRI and ongoing physical therapy.\n\nEarlier in September 2024, Betsy Catron had noted in her September 16, 2024 correspondence that the plaintiff’s discovery had been served on August 2, 2024, but the defendants had not yet received responses. Aaron Whaley replied that Amy had a new MRI on September 11, and he did not yet have those records, while Betsy urged prompt provision of updated treatment information and records.\n\nIn summary, the communications reflect ongoing litigation in the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank matter, with the defense insisting on evaluating current medical films and records before surgery to determine relatedness to the incident, and the plaintiff’s counsel seeking to delay disclosing the treating physician’s identity until after the January 3, 2025 shoulder surgery to avoid jeopardizing treatment. The record also documents Amy Mills’ ongoing treatment status: completed physical therapy, a planned shoulder surgery on January 3, 2025, and a September 11 MRI revealing a new labral tear at the suture from her prior surgery. The parties repeatedly discussed production of medical records and identification of treating providers, against the backdrop of litigation considerations and the surgeon’s willingness to treat patients who are in litigation.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v Forcht Bank, Premise file 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. This narrative reflects the email correspondence regarding discovery and medical records in the Amy Mills v Forcht Bank matter, focusing on communications dated December 12, 2024, and the earlier interim updates between September and November 2024.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Gregg Thornton of Vine Center with Betsy Catron, Sarena Tuttle, and the Amy Mills premise email address copied. In his message, Aaron stated that no one was prohibiting the defense from obtaining the records or copies of all of Amy Mills’s MRIs and other scans, and that those records could be reviewed to determine whether the tear is causally related to the incident. He added that whether Amy Mills undergoes shoulder surgery on January 3 would not affect the ability to review those records. He noted that January 3 was three weeks away and that shortly after that date he would provide Thornton with the names of all new providers as well as an executed medical authorization. He closed by saying that there is nothing the court would do that would move faster than that. Aaron’s contact information shared in this message included Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, telephone 502-583-4022, and agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com. The message also referenced that the email was part of the Amy Mills v Forcht Bank case and included the Amy Mills Filevine project email address in the CC line.\n\nLater on December 12, 2024, Gregg Thornton replied (the message timestamp showing 3:37 PM). He asserted that he would never claim the right to restrict records, but emphasized that his client is only responsible for what is causally related. Since Aaron had indicated this was a new tear, Thornton said they needed to look at it. Thornton provided his contact details: Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507; phone 859-422-6000; fax 859-422-6001; email gthornton@whtlaw.com; and site www.whtlaw.com. He also included a standard confidentiality disclosure found in professional emails and noted the message originated from an iPhone.\n\nEarlier on the same day, Aaron had sent a preliminary note (timestamp around 3:19 PM) to Betsy Catron with a warning that the message was external email. In that exchange, Aaron asked whether Gregg was claiming the right to dictate when Amy Mills could receive medical care ordered by her treating physician. The thread then includes Gregg’s reply (2:29 PM) stating that they cannot agree to waiting; they need to evaluate the current films and records because their expert needs to determine whether additional records are required before the surgery to assess whether the treatment is related to the incident; Aaron’s attempt to delay disclosure until after surgery to “hide the fact that she is in litigation from the surgeon” was not acceptable to them.\n\nThe thread then traces earlier communications in late 2024. In Aaron Whaley’s December 12, 2024 email to Betsy Catron, with a copy to Sarena Tuttle, Gregg Thornton, and the Amy Mills Filevine address, Aaron indicated that they could provide Betsy with all responses to interrogatories and requests for production, including information about who Amy Mills was treating with after January 3. He noted that January 3 was the date of her shoulder surgery and that she wished to wait until after the surgery to disclose the doctor’s identity because the doctor had stated he would not treat a patient who is in litigation, and Amy did not want her surgery canceled.\n\nPreviously, Betsy Catron had asked, on November 26, 2024, who Amy Mills’s PT providers were and who would perform the surgery. Aaron responded that he did not have that information at that time but noted that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. On November 25, 2024, Betsy had requested updated records and to know who Amy Mills was currently treating with so those records could be requested. This line of inquiry sits within ongoing discovery in the case.\n\nThe back-and-forth also reveals historical updates from September through October 2024. On September 16, 2024, Betsy Catron wrote asking for an update on Amy Mills’s treatment and records, and Aaron replied that he was working on it and that Amy had a new MRI on September 11, but he did not yet have those records. Betsy followed up on September 16 about the status. On October 17, 2024, Betsy again asked whether there were new records for Amy Mills and about treatment status. Aaron responded on October 21, 2024, stating that he did not have new records but did note that Amy had a new MRI showing a new tear of her labrum, located at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again. A later message on October 21 referenced that Amy Mills had completed physical therapy and was again in PT. On November 26, 2024, Aaron confirmed that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3, while noting that he did not have updated records at that moment.\n\nIn summary, the December 12, 2024 correspondence reflects a dispute over the timing and scope of medical-record disclosures in the Amy Mills v Forcht Bank case. Aaron Whaley indicated that records, including MRIs, could be reviewed to determine causation and that new provider information and an executed medical authorization would be provided after Amy Mills’s scheduled January 3 shoulder surgery. Gregg Thornton disputed any arrangement that would delay evaluation of current films and records and insisted that records must be reviewed to determine whether the tear is related to the incident, arguing against hiding information from the surgeon. The thread also documents a pattern of prior updates from September through November 2024, including MRI findings showing new labral tears near prior surgical sites, ongoing physical therapy, and the evolving intent to disclose physicians’ identities and treatment providers after the January 3 surgery. The CCs and addresses included in the exchanges identify the involved parties and their contact details, including Betsy Catron, Sarena Tuttle, and Amy Mills Premise file email address, along with the law firm and medical-provider contact information.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank (file: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019) involves client Amy Mills. The following notes summarize a sequence of counsel communications in late 2024 regarding medical records and treatment status for Amy Mills. The exchanges were between Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (Louisville, KY) and Betsy R. Catron of Vine Center ( Lexington, KY), with multiple colleagues copied on the emails. The subject line across the thread was Re: Amy Mills v Forcht Bank.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Betsy Catron, attorney at Vine Center, Lexington, KY, emailed Aaron Whaley noting that written discovery had been served on the Plaintiff on August 2, 2024 but no responses had yet been received. She asked for an update on her client’s treatment and requested that records be provided as soon as possible, and she provided her firm’s contact details. In the same exchange, Aaron replied that he did not have updated records at that moment but did report that Amy had a new MRI on September 11 showing a new tear of her labrum at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Betsy had also communicated that the discovery had been served on August 2, 2024 and emphasized the need for responses to avoid court intervention; she requested updates on treatment and any records as soon as possible, attaching the signature block of her firm (Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507; P 859.422.6000; F 859.422.6001; www.whtlaw.com).\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy again checked in, asking whether there were any new records for the client and an update on her treatment status.\n\nOn October 21, 2024, Aaron replied that he did not have new records but noted that Amy had a new MRI on September 11 showing a labral tear at the suture from her prior surgery and that she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, Betsy asked for updated records and specifically requested to be told who Amy Mills is currently treating with so Betsy could request those records directly.\n\nThe following day, November 26, 2024, Aaron responded: unfortunately, he did not have updated records. He did, however, state that Amy has completed physical therapy and is scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3.\n\nFor reference, the emails included the following participants and contact details: Betsy R. Catron, Attorney, Vine Center, Lexington, KY 40507, P 859.422.6000, F 859.422.6001, www.whtlaw.com; Aaron Whaley, Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022; CC’d recipients included Sarena Tuttle (sarena@whaleylawfirm.com; stuttle.wlf@gmail.com) and Gregg Thornton (GThornton@whtlaw.com).",

      "natural_language": "This file covers the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank case, with client Amy Mills, and tracks a sequence of internal emails among the attorneys handling the matter.\n\nIn late November 2024, Betsy R. Catron, an attorney at WHT Law (Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507), sent an email to Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (and copied colleagues Sarena Tuttle and Gregg Thornton) asking for any updated records related to Amy Mills and, specifically, who Amy is currently treating with so Betsy could request those treatment records. The message, dated Monday, November 25, 2024 at 16:03:58 UTC, included the external‑email caution note about attachments and links from external senders.\n\nThis inquiry followed an earlier thread of communications. On October 21, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied that he did not have updated records in hand but did note that Amy Mills had undergone a new MRI of her shoulder, which revealed a new tear of the labrum at the suture from her prior shoulder surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nBefore that, on September 16, 2024, Betsy had written that written discovery had been served on the Plaintiff on August 2, 2024, but no response had been received. She warned that discovery was past due and asked Aaron to indicate within the next week when he could expect the plaintiff’s responses so as to avoid a court compel order. Betsy also requested any update on Amy’s treatment and, if treatment existed, the corresponding records as soon as possible. The email from Betsy on September 16 included an explicit request for updates on treatment and records and again carried the external‑email caution note.\n\nAaron’s reply, also dated September 16, 2024, stated that he was working on obtaining the information and that Amy had a new MRI on September 11, but he did not yet have those records in his possession.\n\nA related message from Betsy, sent around the same day, reaffirmed the request for treatment updates and for records ASAP, and emphasized the need to address the discovery timeline to avoid court intervention.\n\nIn summary, the correspondence shows a focused effort across September through November 2024 to obtain updated medical records for Amy Mills and to ascertain her current treating provider, in light of a new MRI finding on September 11 and subsequent treatment activity, with multiple reminders about discovery responses and ongoing medical treatment.",

      "natural_language": "This is a chronological narrative of the email correspondence in the case captioned Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, involving client Amy Mills. The communications ran from September through November 2024 and were between Betsy R. Catron, an attorney with WHT Law in Lexington, Kentucky, and Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm in Louisville, with Sarena Tuttle and Gregg Thornton copied on several messages.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied to Betsy Catron that he did not have updated records to provide at that moment but noted that Amy Mills had a new MRI on September 11. He stated that he was working on obtaining those records. In Betsy Catron’s reply sent shortly afterward, she reminded Aaron that written discovery had been served on the plaintiff on August 2, 2024 and had not yet produced responses, and she asked for an update on Amy’s treatment and for the records ASAP to avoid court action to compel discovery.\n\nLater on September 16, 2024, Betsy followed up again to request any available updates on Amy’s treatment and to obtain records if treatment existed. Aaron responded that he did not have the records yet but reiterated that Amy had a new MRI on September 11 and was in the process of obtaining them.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy sent another inquiry asking whether there were any new records for the client and what her treatment status was. Aaron’s subsequent message on October 21, 2024, indicated that he did not have updated records but did provide a medical update: Amy had a new MRI on her shoulder showing a new tear of her labrum, located at the suture from her previous surgery, and she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nMoving forward to late October and November 2024, Betsy continued to seek updated records and current treatment information. On November 25, 2024, Betsy asked whether there were updated records she could obtain and requested confirmation of who Amy Mills was currently treating with so that she could request those records directly. In the following exchange on November 26, 2024, Betsy asked, “Who are her providers for PT and who is doing the surgery?”\n\nAaron Whaley replied that he did not know the PT providers or the surgeon, but he did know that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3 (the year is not specified in the notes). The thread shows the ongoing attempt to obtain current medical records and verification of treating providers as part of the case management process.\n\nThroughout these exchanges, the email chain included numerous copies to Sarena Tuttle (two addresses) and Gregg Thornton, reflecting the involved legal teams at Whaley Law Firm and WHT Law. Betsy Catron’s messages also carried her attorney signature and contact information, indicating her affiliation with Vine Center in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nIn summary, between September and November 2024, the office of Betsy Catron repeatedly asked for updated medical records and confirmation of Amy Mills’s current treatment status. Aaron Whaley repeatedly reported that new imaging existed—specifically a September 11 MRI showing a labral tear at the prior surgical suture—and that Amy was in physical therapy again, but he did not provide the PT providers or the surgeon involved. By late November, the latest status indicated that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3, with no disclosed information on the treating PT providers or the surgeon.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank (file labeled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019), the client is Amy Mills. On December 12, 2024, at 12:19:06 p.m. Eastern Time, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm sent an email to Betsy Catron of Vine Center with copies to Sarena Tuttle, Gregg Thornton, and a Filevine project address (AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). In that message, Aaron told Betsy that he had spoken with Amy and that they could provide all information and responses to Betsy’s interrogatories and request for production. This would include identifying whom Amy is currently treating with after January 3, the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery. Amy wanted to wait to reveal the doctor’s identity until after the surgery, because the doctor will not take her as a patient if she is in litigation, and Amy did not want the surgery canceled.\n\nThe email chain shows a sequence of prior exchanges. On Tuesday, November 26, 2024, Betsy asked who Amy Mills was currently seeing for physical therapy and who would perform the shoulder surgery. Aaron responded that he did not have those specifics at that moment but noted that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. The message included a cautionary external email warning. Earlier, on Monday, November 25, 2024, Betsy had written asking for any updated records and for the names of Amy’s current treating providers so she could request those records.\n\nThe thread further reveals that, on Monday, October 21, 2024, Aaron stated that he did not know the exact providers but did know that Amy had undergone a new MRI on her shoulder showing a new tear of the labrum at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again. Betsy had asked for updates on October 17, 2024, about new records and treatment status. Prior to that, on Monday, September 16, 2024, Aaron indicated that he was working on obtaining records and that Amy had a new MRI on September 11, for which he did not yet have the records. Betsy had also noted earlier that discovery had been served on August 2, 2024, but no response had been received, and she asked for an update within a week to avoid a motion to compel. Aaron had replied that he was working on it and that he did not yet have the MRI records from September.\n\nThe correspondence includes standard attorney contact details. Betsy R. Catron is listed with Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, phone 859-422-6000, fax 859-422-6001, and website www.whtlaw.com. Aaron Whaley’s signature identifies Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-583-4022.

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nRe: Amy Mills v Forcht Bank\n\nOn December 12, 2024, Gregg Thornton, a member of WHT Law, sent an email regarding the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank matter to Aaron Whaley and Betsy Catron, with Sarena Tuttle and a Filevine project email address copied on the thread. In his message, Thornton stated that the opposing side could not agree to the proposed arrangement because Amy Mills is in litigation. He explained that the defense team needed to evaluate current films and records so their expert could determine whether anything additional was needed before Amy’s upcoming shoulder surgery in order to render an opinion about whether the surgery is related to the incident. Thornton cautioned that waiting until after the surgery to conceal the litigation from the surgeon was unacceptable. He signed as MEM BER at the Vine Center, Lexington, KY, and included standard confidentiality language warning that the email and any attachments are privileged and confidential and should be deleted if received in error.\n\nEarlier that same day, Aaron Whaley replied to Betsy Catron and copied the same recipients. His external-email notice appeared at the top of the message. Whaley reported that he had spoken with Amy and that they could agree to provide Betsy Catron with all information and responses to interrogatories and requests for production, including who Amy is treating with after January 3 (the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery). He stated that Amy would like to wait to reveal the doctor’s identity until after the surgery because the doctor has indicated he will not take her as a patient if she is in litigation, and Amy does not want her surgery canceled.\n\nThis email thread sits within a broader discovery and treatment-status narrative dating back to September 2024. On September 16, 2024, Betsy Catron asked Aaron Whaley for an update, noting that written discovery had been served on August 2, 2024, and requesting the plaintiff’s records if there were any treatment updates. Whaley responded later that day that Amy had had a new MRI on September 11, which showed a new tear of her labrum at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was in physical therapy (PT) again, but Whaley did not yet have the records.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy followed up again, asking if there were any new records for Amy Mills and for an update on her treatment status. Whaley replied on October 21, 2024, saying he did not have updated records and that Amy had received a new MRI showing a labral tear located at the sutures from the prior surgery, and that she was in PT again.\n\nThe thread continued with Betsy’s inquiry on November 25, 2024, asking for any updated records and specifically who Amy was currently treating with so those records could be requested. Whaley replied on November 26, 2024, that he did not have updated records; he did know that Amy had completed PT and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. Betsy followed up again on November 26, 2024, asking for the names of Amy’s PT providers and who would be performing the surgery.\n\nIn the same December 12, 2024 exchange, Aaron Whaley stated that he was willing to provide all information and responses to interrogatories and production requests, including the identity of Amy’s current treatment providers after January 3. He reiterated that January 3 marks the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery and that Amy preferred not to disclose the doctor’s identity before that date. He added that the doctor had indicated he would not take a patient who is in litigation, and Amy did not want her surgery canceled.\n\nTaken together, the communications reflect a litigation-centered context for Amy Mills’s medical treatment records related to a shoulder injury and surgery, with contemporaneous concerns about the timing of disclosing treating providers and the potential impact of litigation status on medical care. The messages include multiple external-email warnings and standard confidentiality notices, and they document a sequence of MRI findings (notably a new labral tear at the prior suture site), ongoing physical therapy, a scheduled shoulder surgery on January 3, and the conditional release of treating-provider information after the stated surgery date.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills Premise 04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. This note summarizes an email thread connected to the case Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, involving Amy Mills’s medical treatment status, discovery responses, and the scheduling of her shoulder surgery, as discussed by counsel in December 2024 and in prior months.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Betsy R. Catron of WHT Law wrote to Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm noting that written discovery had been served on the Plaintiff on August 2, 2024 but had not yet been answered. She stated that because the discovery was past due, she wanted to know when she could expect the Plaintiff’s responses, to avoid seeking court intervention to compel. Betsy also requested an update on the Plaintiff’s treatment and asked for records as soon as available. Aaron Whaley replied that he was working on it and that the Plaintiff had a new MRI on September 11, but he did not yet have those records.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Betsy Catron checked in again for an update on whether there were any new records. Aaron’s response on October 21, 2024 stated that he did not have updated records to provide yet but did know that Amy Mills had a new MRI on her shoulder indicating a new tear of the labrum at the suture from her previous surgery, and that she was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nOn October 21, 2024 Betsy followed up to inquire about who Amy Mills was currently treating with and what records could be obtained. Aaron replied that he could not provide those details at that moment but reiterated that Amy had had a new MRI on September 11 and that she was in physical therapy again.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, Betsy asked for any updated records and specifically requested to know who Amy Mills was currently treating so those providers’ records could be requested. Aaron responded on November 26, 2024 that he did not have updated records to provide at that time, but he did confirm that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. Betsy had previously asked for the names of Amy’s providers for physical therapy and the surgeon who would perform the surgery.\n\nOn November 26, 2024, Betsy had previously asked, “Who are her providers for PT and who is doing the surgery?” Aaron had replied that he did not have updated records to share yet but confirmed the PT status and the January 3 surgery date.\n\nIn addition to the above, a December 12, 2024 email thread began with a message from Aaron Whaley to Betsy Catron (and others) stating that he could agree to provide information and responses to interrogatories and requests for production, including who Amy Mills was treating with after January 3. He explained that January 3 was the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery and that Amy would prefer to wait until after the surgery to reveal the doctor’s identity, noting that the doctor had indicated he would not take her as a patient if she remained in litigation and that Amy did not want her surgery canceled.\n\nThat same day, December 12, 2024 at approximately 2:29 PM, Gregg Thornton of WHT Law replied: “Aaron we cannot agree to this. First she is in litigation. We need to evaluate the current films and records because our expert needs to tell us if they need anything else before the surgery is performed to be able to give an opinion if it is related to this incident. Waiting until after the surgery because you want to hide the fact that she is in litigation from the surgeon is not something we can agree to.” Thornton’s message was followed by his standard confidentiality and privilege notice with the WHT Law Firm contact information.\n\nThe December 12, 2024 exchange thus centers on two core issues: (1) whether Amy Mills can disclose the identity of her treating doctor and provide certain medical information before her January 3 shoulder surgery, given that she is in litigation; and (2) whether the defense team will review current imaging and records and defer any dependent actions until after the surgery to avoid exposing litigation status to the surgeon. The parties reiterate the tension between timely discovery and the implications of litigation status on medical treatment and record sharing, with Amy Mills’s upcoming January 3 shoulder surgery a focal point of the discussion.",

      "natural_language": "In the case Amy Mills v Forcht Bank (Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019; Client: Amy Mills), the following email communications occurred between September and December 2024 among Amy Mills’ counsel and opposing counsel. The participants include Gregg Thornton of WHT Law (Vine Center, Lexington, KY), Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm (Louisville, KY), and Betsy Catron plus Sarena Tuttle on distribution. The notes reference a Filevine project address for Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019.\n\nOn September 16, 2024, Betsy Catron reported that written discovery had been served on the Plaintiff on August 2, 2024, but no responses had yet been received. She asked for a timeline to avoid a court motion to compel and requested any updates on the plaintiff’s treatment and accompanying records. Aaron Whaley replied that he did not have updates yet but was working on obtaining them; he noted that Amy had a new MRI on September 11 and that he did not yet have those records.\n\nA follow-up from Betsy on October 17, 2024, inquired whether Aaron had any new records or information regarding Amy’s treatment status. Aaron responded on October 21, 2024 that he did not have new records to share at that time. He did indicate that Amy’s shoulder MRI showed a new tear of the labrum at the suture from her prior surgery and that she was back in physical therapy.\n\nToward the end of November 2024, Betsy asked for updated records and to identify Amy’s current treatment providers so she could request those records. On November 26, 2024, Aaron replied that he did not have new information on providers, but he did confirm that Amy had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3. Betsy had previously requested information about who was treating Amy for physical therapy and who would perform the surgery.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, the parties exchanged further messages. Aaron Whaley told Betsy that they could provide all information and responses to interrogatories and requests for production, including who Amy would be treating with after January 3. He noted that January 3 is the date of Amy’s upcoming shoulder surgery and that Amy would like to wait until after that date to reveal the doctor’s identity, because the doctor had said he would not take a patient who is in litigation, and Amy did not want her surgery canceled.\n\nGregg Thornton responded later that day, stating, “Aaron we cannot agree to this. First she is in litigation. We need to evaluate the current films and records because our expert needs to tell us if they need anything else before the surgery is performed to be able to give an opinion if it is related to this incident. Waiting until after the surgery because you want to hide the fact that she is in litigation from the surgeon is not something we can agree to.”\n\nIn reply, Aaron Whaley asked, “Gregg, are you asserting that you have the right to dictate when my client can receive medical care that has been ordered by her treating physician?” Gregg Thornton later clarified, “Absolutely not I would never do that. However my client is only responsible for what is causally related and since you said this is a new tear we need to look at it.”",

      "natural_language": "This note summarizes a sequence of email communications in the case Amy Mills v Forcht Bank, associated with the file Amy Mills Premise 04-26-2019 and the client Amy Mills. The exchanges occurred primarily in December 2024, with earlier context notes dating back to September through November 2024.\n\nOn December 12, 2024, Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm wrote to Gregg Thornton of Vine Center, copying Betsy Catron, Sarena Tuttle, and the Amy Mills Filevine project address. Whaley stated that no one was saying Thornton could not obtain records or copies of all of Amy Mills’s MRIs and other scans; those records could be reviewed to determine whether a tear is related to the incident. He added that whether Amy Mills undergoes surgery on January 3 would not affect that analysis. Whaley indicated that January 3 is in three weeks, and that shortly after that date he would be able to provide Thornton with the names of all new providers as well as an executed medical authorization. He also asserted that there is nothing the court will do that would be faster than that timeline. Whaley signed as with Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, with the phone number 502-583-4022.\n\nLater on December 12, 2024, Gregg Thornton replied, stating, “Absolutely not I would never do that. However my client is only responsible for what is causally related and since you said this is a new tear we need to look at it.” Thornton’s signature block followed, showing his firm Vine Center at 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with the phone number 859-422-6000, fax 859-422-6001, and email gthornton@whtlaw.com.\n\nAlso on December 12, 2024, a separate message from Aaron Whaley appeared at 3:19 PM, prefaced with an external email warning. In that note, Whaley asked Thornton whether he was asserting the right to dictate when the client could receive medical care ordered by her treating physician, given that Amy Mills is in litigation and the surgeon had been instructed to act in accordance with her physician’s orders.\n\nEarlier that same day, at 2:29 PM, Thornton wrote that he could not agree to the proposed arrangement. He explained that because Amy Mills is in litigation, they needed to evaluate the current films and records so that their expert could determine whether anything else was needed before the surgery to be able to opine on whether the surgery is related to the incident. He added that waiting until after the surgery in order to “hide” the litigation from the surgeon is not something they could agree to.\n\nAt 12:19 PM, Whaley had written a prior message to Betsy Catron (with Betsy Catron copied on the thread and to other recipients) indicating that he and Amy Mills could agree to provide all information and responses to Betsy Catron’s interrogatories and requests for production. This included disclosing who Amy Mills was treating with after January 3. Whaley noted that January 3 was the date of her upcoming shoulder surgery, and Amy Mills would prefer to wait until after that surgery to reveal the doctor’s identity. He explained that the doctor had stated he would not take a patient if the patient were in litigation, and Amy Mills did not want her surgery canceled.\n\nThis December 12 sequence followed earlier communications in the same case. On November 26, 2024, Betsy Catron had written asking for updated records and, specifically, who Amy Mills was currently treating with so those records could be requested. Aaron Whaley replied that he did not have the requested providers for physical therapy or the surgeon’s identity, but he did know that Amy Mills had completed physical therapy and was scheduled for shoulder surgery on January 3.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, Betsy Catron had requested updated records and the identity of Amy Mills’s current treating providers so she could request those records. On October 21, 2024, Betsy Catron stated that she did not have the providers but knew there had been a new MRI showing a new tear in Amy Mills’s shoulder labrum, located at the suture from her previous surgery, and that Amy Mills was currently in physical therapy again.\n\nBetsy Catron had previously written on October 17, 2024, checking in for any new records and the status of Amy Mills’s treatment. On September 16, 2024, Betsy Catron sent two messages: at 11:18 AM she asked for an update, noting that Amy Mills had a new MRI on September 11 and that she did not yet have those records; at 11:17 AM she mentioned that written discovery on Amy Mills had been served on August 2, 2024, and, noting some garbled content, asked to be informed within the next week when responses could be expected to avoid court compulsion, and requested any available updates on treatment and records if treatment existed.\n\nIn sum, the December 12, 2024 communications built on a longer thread about the management of medical records, the timing and conditions of treatment and surgery (notably a shoulder surgery scheduled for January 3), and the curricular need to identify treating providers—while balancing the plaintiff’s litigation status and the desire to protect the treating physician(s) from appearing to tailor care around litigation. The parties repeatedly discussed whether records could be supplied now and how the identities of treating providers would be disclosed, with the surgeon reportedly not accepting patients who are in litigation and with Amy Mills’s counsel indicating a willingness to provide information after the January 3 surgery and to share the medical authorization and provider list shortly thereafter.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nRe: August interrogatories. On December 17, 2024, at 12:21:40 PM (GMT-05:00), an email was sent from Sarena Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm to Aaron Whaley, with a copy to the Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 Filevine project email address. The subject line indicated the matter concerned the August interrogatories. In the body of the message, Sarena explained that the list included every provider listed in Amy Mills’s file, noting that most of the firm’s most recent CMRs (case medical reports) were from 2023 through March 2024. She added that this did not necessarily mean Amy had seen those providers in 2023 or 2024, and asked whether Aaron would like her to review Amy’s records and narrow the list.\n\nSarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, provided her contact details and signature, including the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971 and office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104. She noted a new email address: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nEarlier in the thread, Aaron Whaley had replied on December 17, 2024, at 12:12? PM, asking: “That looks good. The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?”\n\nPrior to that, on December 17, 2024, at 11:51? AM, Sarena sent a draft message to AW. She wrote that she had prepared the draft you requested, listing all known providers and any related objections, and asked AW to review for approval before submitting to the DC. She also stated that she would send updated CRRs to all known providers since most were over a year old.\n\nThe chain also shows an email from Aaron Whaley on December 16, 2024 at 12:00? PM, requesting: “Please prepare a draft response with what we have in the file that is responsive to the request.” The thread then closes with Aaron’s signature block repeating his contact information at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nIn sum, the correspondence from mid-December 2024 centers on preparing a draft response to the August interrogatories, with a comprehensive list of providers drawn from Amy Mills’s file (noting that most current medical reports were dated 2023 through March 2024), a plan to review and potentially narrow the list, and a plan to issue updated CRRs to providers given that many are over a year old. The exchange includes confirmations of the draft provider list, discussion of any objections, and the intent to move forward with submission to the district court, along with acknowledgement of the new email address for Sarena.",

Tuttle of The Whaley Law Firm, with Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 listed in the Filevine project email CC as AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, concerning a draft response to the August interrogatories.\n\nThe thread begins with Aaron Whaley replying to a prior thread on December 17, 2024 at 12:38:11 PM GMT-05:00, writing simply, “Yes, please do.” Earlier that day, at 12:21 PM (time shown as 12:21?PM in the thread), Sarena M. Tuttle sent a message explaining that the list of providers under consideration includes every provider listed in Amy Mills’ file, and that most of the latest CMRs are from 2023 through March 2024. She cautioned, however, that this does not necessarily mean Amy Mills saw those providers in 2023 or 2024, and she asked whether Aaron would like her to review the records and narrow the list down.\n\nPrior to that, at 12:12 PM on December 17, 2024 (time shown as 12:12?PM), Aaron asked, “That looks good. The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?” In an earlier message from 11:51 AM on December 17, 2024 (time shown as 11:51?AM), Sarena sent the draft Aaron had requested. She stated that she had listed all known providers and any related objections, and asked for approval before submitting to the DC. She also noted that she would send updated CRRs to all known providers since most are over a year old.\n\nThe chain traces back to an initial instruction on December 16, 2024 at 12:00 PM (time shown as 12:00?PM), when Aaron instructed Sarena to prepare a draft response with what they have in the file that is responsive to the request.\n\nThe thread closes with the typical firm signatures from Aaron Whaley and Sarena M. Tuttle, including their contact details. The messages reference The Whaley Law Firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with phone numbers listed as D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104 for Sarena, and 502-583-4022 for Aaron. Sarena notes her role as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager and includes her email, Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, while also indicating a new email address. The overall context is a coordinated effort to prepare a responsive draft regarding the August interrogatories, including consideration of which providers to include and the timing of updated CRRs.",

The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?”\n\n- On December 17, 2024 at 12:21 PM, Sarena responded: “It is every provider listed in her file, most of which our most recent CMRs are from 2023 through March 2024. However, that is not to say she saw the providers in 2023/2024. Would you like me to review her records & narrow it down?” She again signed with her title and contact details and the note about the new email address.\n\n- On December 17, 2024 at 12:38 PM, Aaron replied: “Yes, please do.”\n\n- The thread then includes Sarena’s December 17, 2024 message reiterating that she would compile all known providers and any related objections for the draft, to be submitted to the DC, and that updated CRRs would be sent to all known providers since most are over a year old, followed by her signature with the same contact information and new email note.\n\nThe overall thread shows the team discussing and preparing a draft response to interrogatories, with the main decision points being whether to list all providers, whether to narrow the list to those actually seen in 2023/2024, and the plan to issue current CRRs to providers. The December 19, 2024 email from Sarena confirms the draft list of known providers for 2023 (including DOS) and asks Aaron to indicate any needed changes. The communication repeatedly references that most of the recent CMRs are from 2023 through March 2024, and it notes that listing all providers does not necessarily mean Amy Mills saw all those providers in 2023 or 2024. The tone throughout is one of collaboration and review prior to submitting to the DC, with an emphasis on updating CRRs for providers where they are over a year old.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. Re: August interrogatories. The note details a chain of email exchanges at The Whaley Law Firm concerning the provider list to be used in response to August interrogatories for Amy Mills.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Aaron Whaley emailed Sarena Tuttle regarding the August interrogatories in the Amy Mills file. In his message he noted that in the provider list item a) the entry appears blank and suggested that this could simply be a formatting issue. The email was sent from Aaron Whaley of the Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle, with the case’s Filevine project email address cc’d: Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 - Filevine Project Email Address AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com. The message thread also shows the case context and subject line “Re: August interrogatories.”\n\nIn a prior message, dated December 19, 2024, Sarena Tuttle replied to Aaron with the draft provider information. She wrote, “Here you go. :) I listed the known providers for 2023 per the records we have. I also included DOS which I do not normally do. Let me know if there are any changes needed.” Her signature identified her as Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal & Workers' Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, and the contact numbers D: (502) 357-9971 and O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104, plus the note that the email address is Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and an indication to note the new email address.\n\nEarlier in the thread, on December 17, 2024, Aaron Whaley replied, “Yes, please do.” In a contemporaneous message, Sarena asked whether she should review Amy Mills’s records to narrow the provider list, noting that the list includes every provider listed in the file and that most of their most recent CMRs are from 2023 through March 2024, while cautioning that this does not necessarily mean the patient saw those providers in 2023 or 2024. Her message, like the others, was signed with her department title and contact information.\n\nAlso on December 17, 2024, at 12:12 PM, Aaron Whaley commented, “That looks good. The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?” The thread also contains an earlier message from December 17, 2024, at 11:51 AM from Sarena, titled “Good afternoon AW,” which stated: “Here is the draft you requested. I listed all known providers and any related objections, please review for approval before submitting to the DC. I will get updated CRRs out to all known providers as well since most are over a year old.” The signatures in these messages again identified Sarena M. Tuttle and provided her contact details at The Whaley Law Firm.\n\nThe chain begins with a December 16, 2024, 12:00 PM message from Aaron Whaley requesting the preparation of a draft response with what is in the file that is responsive to the request, followed by the subsequent December 17–20 exchanges in which the provider list and related considerations were discussed and drafted for submission to the DC. Throughout, the correspondence lists the firm’s standard contact details for Sarena Tuttle, including the firm address, phone numbers, and her email, and includes the case’s Filevine project email address in the cc field for tracking and project management purposes.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills — Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019\nClient: Amy Mills\n\nThis note summarizes a December 2024 email thread about the August interrogatories and the provider list for the case of Amy Mills. The primary correspondence ran among Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and Aaron Whaley, with Amy Mills Premise in copy, related to preparing a draft response and compiling a list of providers.\n\nThe thread began with an email from Sarena on December 16, 2024, in which Aaron Whaley urged her to prepare a draft response using the information already in the file that would be responsive to the August interrogatories. The message asked for a draft to address the request directly. This exchange was part of a broader effort to respond to the district court’s (DC) inquiry and to ensure that the file would be properly supported by updated or corrected records.\n\nOn December 17, 2024, Sarena sent a draft in response to Aaron’s request. She stated that she had listed all known providers and noted any related objections, adding that she would also obtain updated CRRs for all known providers since most CRRs were over a year old. She stated that the draft was intended for approval before submission to the district court.\n\nLater on December 17, 2024, Aaron replied, asking for clarification: “That looks good. The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?” A few minutes later, at 12:12 PM, Aaron again weighed in, and Sarena responded at 12:21 PM, explaining that the draft included every provider listed in the client’s file, most of whose CMRs dated from 2023 through March 2024. She cautioned that this did not necessarily mean the client saw those providers in 2023 or 2024 and offered to review the records to narrow the list if needed.\n\nAt 12:38 PM on December 17, 2024, Aaron replied, “Yes, please do.” In response, Sarena indicated that she would proceed with reviewing the records to narrow the list to those actually seen by the client, while continuing to list all known providers and any objections.\n\nOn December 19, 2024, Sarena sent an updated version. She wrote, “Here you go. :) I listed the known providers for 2023 per the records we have. I also included DOS which I do not normally do. Let me know if there are any changes needed.” This message included her standard professional signature with her title, firm, address, telephone numbers, and her note about a new email address.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Aaron commented that in the provider list item “a” it looked blank and suggested it could be a formatting issue. He again referenced the formatting concern in his message.\n\nShortly after, at 12:05:01 PM on December 20, 2024 (GMT-05:00), Sarena replied that she had observed the same formatting issue. She explained that the blank appeared due to a formatting error and stated that when she opens the PDF on her computer the item is not missing. She said she would verify proper formatting on the PDF version upon approval. Sarena again included her contact information and noted her new email address.\n\nThe CC for the primary message included Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 with the Filevine project email address AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com, indicating that Amy Mills was kept in the loop for these communications. The correspondence illustrates a collaborative effort to finalize the August interrogatories response and ensure an accurate, properly formatted provider list, with ongoing checks for formatting accuracy in the PDF version before final submission to the district court.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills.\n\nThis note records correspondence regarding the August interrogatories in the Amy Mills Premise case. The thread begins with an email from Aaron Whaley of Whaley Law Firm to Sarena Tuttle, dated December 20, 2024 at 03:59:13 GMT-05:00. In the message, with Amy Mills’ Filevine project email address CC’d (Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 - Filevine Project Email Address: AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com), Aaron states: “Ok, then good to go. File them on December 26.”\n\nThe preceding exchange began earlier that week and spanned several days of drafting and review. On December 16, 2024 at 12:00 PM, Aaron Whaley asked Sarena to prepare a draft response that would address the August interrogatories using the materials currently in the file. Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, replied on December 17, 2024 at 11:51 AM. She explained that the draft would list all known providers and any related objections, and that she would obtain approval before submitting to the district agency (DC). She noted that most of the known provider records’ CRRs would need updating, given that many were over a year old. Her signature block identified her as Sarena M. Tuttle and provided her contact information.\n\nOn December 17, 2024 at 12:12 PM, Aaron responded that the draft looked good and asked whether the provider list covered all providers since January 1, 2023. Sarena confirmed in another message later that day (12:21 PM) that the draft indeed covered every provider listed in Amy Mills’ file, with most recent CMRs from 2023 through March 2024, while acknowledging that this did not necessarily mean Amy Mills saw those providers in 2023 or 2024. She asked whether Aaron would like her to review the records further and narrow the list accordingly. Aaron agreed that the list seemed to cover all providers since 01/01/2023, as reflected in his earlier inquiry.\n\nIn a December 19, 2024 email, Sarena delivered a draft for review. She stated she had listed all known providers and any related objections, and requested Aaron’s review for approval before submitting to the DC. She also noted that she would issue updated CRRs to all known providers, recognizing that most CRRs were over a year old. Her message again included her standard signature with her title and contact information.\n\nThe thread continued with a December 20, 2024 message from Sarena noting a formatting error she observed: “I saw that. It is a formatting error. When I open on my computer it is not there, I will verify proper formatting on the PDF version upon Approval.” Later that day, Aaron replied with a succinct directive: “Ok, then good to go. File them on December 26.”\n\nAccompanying the chain were the standard email footers and signatures for both counsel, repeatedly showing their professional titles, the Whaley Law Firm address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), multiple phone numbers (D: 502-357-9971; O: 502-583-4022 ext 104; general line 502-583-4022), and email contact details (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com and agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com). The messages also circulated the case’s Filevine-related CC address for Amy Mills Premise, underscoring that the matter centers on the August interrogatories for the Amy Mills Premise case, with a file designation of Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019 and the client listed as Amy Mills. The correspondence confirms that the plan was to file the related documents on December 26.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. Client: Amy Mills. The matter under discussion was the August interrogatories.\n\nOn December 23, 2024, in a message titled “Re: August interrogatories,” Sarena M. Tuttle, the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email from sarena@whaleylawfirm.com to Aaron Whaley at agwhaley@whaleylawfirm.com. The message CC’d Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 – Filevine Project Email Address (AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com). The header showed the date as Mon Dec 23 2024 10:20:34 GMT-05:00, and the body simply stated, “Will do.” Her signature block followed, detailing her position, The Whaley Law Firm’s address (712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222), and contact numbers (D: 502-357-9971, O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), along with her new email address (Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com).\n\nEarlier in the thread, there were several back-and-forth exchanges. On December 20, 2024, at about 3:59 PM (timestamp shown as 3:59?PM), Aaron Whaley replied, “Ok, then good to go. File them on December 26.” Before that, at 12:05 PM (timestamp shown as 12:05?PM), Sarena Tuttle explained that a formatting error had occurred with a document she opened on her computer and that she would verify proper formatting on the PDF version upon approval. She signed again with her Whaley Law Firm credentials and new email address.\n\nOn December 20, 2024 at about 11:58 AM, Aaron commented that in the provider list, item a) looked blank and suggested it could be a formatting issue. The previous message from Sarena, at 12:24 PM, had provided the draft: “Here you go. :) I listed the known providers for 2023 per the records we have. I also included DOS which I do not normally do. Let me know if there are any changes needed.” This message included Sarena’s full signature block.\n\nOn December 17, 2024, at 12:21 PM, Sarena stated: “It is every provider listed in her file, most of which our most recent CMRs are from 2023 through March 2024. However, that is not to say she saw the providers in 2023/2024. Would you like me to review her records & narrow it down?” Aaron replied at 12:12 PM: “That looks good. The list of providers is all provider since 01/01/2023?” Earlier, at 12:38 PM, Aaron requested confirmation, and Sarena affirmed with her signature.\n\nThe thread began on December 16, 2024, with Aaron Whaley directing: “Please prepare a draft response with what we have in the file that is responsive to the request.” The subsequent messages show Sarena and Aaron refining the draft: Sarena compiled a comprehensive list of known providers with any related objections, asked for approval before submission to the District Court (DC), and noted that updated CRRs would be sent to all known providers since many were over a year old.\n\nAcross the exchanges, the participants repeatedly referenced the August interrogatories and the need to align the provider list with records in Amy Mills’s file, including whether to include dates of service (DOS) and whether to broaden or narrow the provider list based on the records from 2023 through early 2024. The communications also included standard administrative details such as signatures, office addresses, and contact information for Sarena, with emphasis on her new personal email address. The overall plan culminated in the December 20–23 exchange, with Aaron indicating readiness to file the interrogatories on December 26.",

In the body, Sarena wrote: “Good afternoon Counsel, We hope that you all had a wonderful holiday. Please find attached the Plaintiff's Response to the Defendant Forcht Bank's 3rd set of Interrogatories and 4th set of Requests for Production of Documents. Our Notice of Service was filed moments ago via CourtNet Envelope 9457257. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us directly to discuss them in further detail.” Sarena signed as Litigation Paralegal & Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, providing the firm’s address at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with direct line (502) 357-9971, office line (502) 583-4022 ext 104, and the note “PLEASE NOTE NEW EMAIL ADDRESS.” The signature also includes her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com.\n\nThe following day, December 27, 2024, Betsy R. Catron, Attorney at WHT Law, sent a reply to Aaron Whaley, with copies to Sarena Tuttle and Gregg Thornton, and cc’ed the Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 file. In the body of Betsy’s message, she stated that Aaron’s responses are deficient. She noted there are no new medical providers identified, including who Amy Mills has been treating with throughout the past year and who is performing her upcoming surgery. Betsy explained that they cannot subpoena records if they do not know who Amy Mills has been treating with. She added that if Amy Mills is claiming this upcoming surgery as related to her 2019 fall, they are entitled to this information. Betsy signed as Attorney for WHT Law, and provided her firm’s contact details and location at Vine Center, 333 West Vine Street, Suite 1100, Lexington, KY 40507, with phone number 859.422.6000, fax 859.422.6001, and the firm’s website www.whtlaw.com.\n\nIn summary, the case note documents two sequential communications regarding the Plaintiff’s Response to the Defendant’s third set of interrogatories and fourth set of requests for production of documents, including notice of service filed via CourtNet envelope 9457257, and a subsequent attorney-to-attorney exchange critiquing the sufficiency of the medical-provider information and the related subpoena needs for records concerning Amy Mills’ medical treatment and upcoming surgery related to the 2019 fall.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills – Premise, file name Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019. The client is Amy Mills.\n\nRe: Record requests. On January 13, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager for The Whaley Law Firm, sent an email regarding record requests. The message was addressed to Aaron Whaley and CC’d to the Filevine project email for Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019. The subject indicates a focus on record requests. In the body of the note, Tuttle records that a DC authentication was sent to the client via DocuSign, that a request for records (CRR) was sent to Dr. Magone via fax (covering 2014 to present), and that a CRR was sent to PT Pros London via email (covering 2014 to present, all locations). Tuttle’s signature block identifies her as a Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, with the firm’s Louisville address, phone numbers, and her email, noting in parentheses to please note the new email address.\n\nThat same day, in a reply dated January 13, 2025, at about 9:30 a.m., Aaron Whaley wrote back. He stated that the client is treating with Dr. Magone in London, Kentucky, who is an orthopedic doctor, and that the client is also treated with PT Pros in London. He requested all records from Dr. Magone for the last five years. He believed they had previously requested records from PT Pros in Corbin, so he asked for records from PT Pros London that extend from the earliest date they have on file from that provider. He also requested the bills. He emphasized urgency, noting that the court gave them 45 days to obtain the records and to provide them in their answers to interrogatories. He mentioned that last month they listed some treatment dates, but did not provide any records or bills. He directed that the records and bills be gathered and provided, and that a supplement be prepared for defense counsel. He also asked defense counsel again for the medical authorization to give to the client for the client to sign.\n\nAaron Whaley’s signature block follows, with his contact information for Whaley Law Firm at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, including the phone numbers 502-583-4022 and 502-357-9971.\n\nNote: Sarena M.

On February 27, 2025, the matter was referenced in an email chain labeled Re: Amy Mills v Forcht Bank - PL Supp Resp to DC Forcht Disc Req. The email thread involved Sarena Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and Aaron Whaley, with Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 CC’d on the exchanges.\n\nIn an email sent on the morning of February 27, 2025, at 9:44 AM, Sarena Tuttle wrote to Mrs. Catron that Mrs. Mills’s Supplemental Responses to the Defendant’s 3rd and 4th Discovery Requests were attached, and she invited any questions or discussions to address the matter in further detail. The message included Sarena’s contact information and noted that there was a new email address for her: Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com. Her signature identified her as the Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager for The Whaley Law Firm, located at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with D: (502) 357-9971, O: (502) 583-4022 ext 104.\n\nEarlier in the day, at 1:22 PM, Aaron Whaley replied, noting, “Make sure the actual records and bills are attached to them that we have received.” His signature followed, showing his affiliation with The Whaley Law Firm and listing the firm’s address—712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222—and the contact number 502-583-4022.\n\nLater still, at 1:27 PM, Sarena responded with the line, “The packet was 72 pages, I assume all pages were attached correctly.” This message carried her standard signature block, reiterating her role at The Whaley Law Firm and including the firm’s address, direct line (D: 502-357-9971), main line (O: 502-583-4022 ext 104), and her email address Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com, again noting the parenthetical reminder to please note the new email address. The message also reflected the same case context and the subject matter regarding supplemental discovery responses.\n\nThe email chain also shows that the message to Mrs. Catron included the attachment of Mrs. Mills’s Supplemental Responses to the Defendant’s 3rd and 4th Discovery Requests, with Sarena’s note that if there were questions, they should be discussed directly. The CC for the correspondence included Amy Mills Premise 04/26/2019 at the email AmyMillsPremiseZ995806@louisvilleaccidentlawyer.filevineapp.com.\n\nFor completeness, Aaron Whaley’s signature appeared with the Whaley Law Firm details: 712 Lyndon Ln, Louisville, KY 40222, 502-583-4022, following his reply.",

In Betsy’s 3:49 PM message to Aaron, she wrote: “I appreciate it, Aaron. Please keep me informed should any surgery be scheduled.” Aaron replied to Betsy on February 27, 2025 at 1:33 PM: “Betsy, we have sent you everything we have.

The primary objective stated in the March 20 message was to copy and forward the materials to defense counsel.",

      "natural_language": "In the Mills matter, the file labeled Amy-Mills-Premise-04-26-2019 involves client Amy Mills. The thread titled “Re: FW: Mills,” dated March 21, 2025, shows a series of internal actions and communications among The Whaley Law Firm staff. On March 21, 2025, Sarena M. Tuttle, a litigation paralegal and workers’ compensation case manager at The Whaley Law Firm, created a Dropbox folder and shared it with DC and the assistant; the assistant acknowledged the link; she drafted a NOS; she replied to the assistant’s acknowledgment with the NOS; and she created a hard CD which FG will mail out with a copy of the NOS and the Certification Pages. Sarena’s contact information is: The Whaley Law Firm, 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222; direct line 502-357-9971; office line 502-583-4022 ext 104; email Sarena@WhaleyLawFirm.com (noting the new email address).\n\nThe surrounding email activity shows a sequence of communications from mid-February to March 2025 regarding imaging and records. On February 27, 2025, Betsy Catron emailed Aaron Whaley to say, “Betsy, we have sent you everything we have. I will continue to send you anything we get in,” and she added that she would appreciate being kept informed should any surgery be scheduled. Earlier that day, Aaron had replied to Betsy saying that all available materials had been sent and that he would continue to forward anything received. Betsy had previously asked on February 27, 2025, at 3:49 PM to be kept informed about any surgery. On March 12, 2025, at 10:48 AM, Betsy sent a forwarded message asking Aaron where his client had her September 11, 2024 MRI done. Later that same day, at 12:19 PM, Aaron asked, “Do we have this?” and at 1:05 PM, Sarena responded that the results were in the CHI St. Joseph Orthopedics Records (Pages 25–30), appeared completed in-house, and that the results were attached. The thread shows that on March 14, 2025, at 3:49 PM, Aaron requested the actual films for all MRI/CT/X-ray studies. On March 17, 2025, at 3:25 PM, Sarena wrote that she had called Radiology, obtained a direct fax number, and sent the CRR. On March 20, 2025, at 11:55 AM, Sarena noted that she received an imaging CD and had placed it in Aaron’s chair; later, at 2:01 PM, Aaron asked if a copy could be made and forwarded to defense counsel. On March 21, 2025, Sarena finalized the earlier steps by confirming the Dropbox folder creation, sharing, and related administrative tasks (as described above), including drafting and signing off on the NOS and arranging a hard CD distribution.\n\nAll individuals referenced in the thread and the key participants include Sarena M. Tuttle, Litigation Paralegal and Workers’ Compensation Case Manager at The Whaley Law Firm, and Aaron Whaley. Their communications originate from The Whaley Law Firm’s Louisville, Kentucky office at 712 Lyndon Lane, Louisville, KY 40222, with the contact details cited above for Sarena. The chain also includes Betsy Catron, who appears to be communicating with Aaron regarding MRI history and potential surgery timing. The thread confirms the following documented actions: creation of a Dropbox folder and sharing with the defense and assistant; acknowledgment of the shared link; drafting of the NOS; correspondence acknowledging the NOS; creation of a hard CD containing the NOS and Certification Pages; and ongoing handling of imaging CDs, radiology communications, and requests for actual film copies, as well as the location of prior MRI work and related records.",

      "natural_language": "Case: Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank, Knox Circuit Court. Client: Amy Mills. The file note describes a chain of emails in September through October 2025 in which Amy Mills’ counsel sought to retain David Johnson of Johnson Health and Safety as a consulting expert for the matter, with coordination of an upcoming site inspection and related terms.\n\nThe initial contact occurred on September 10, 2025, when Adam Redden of DECAMILLIS & MATTINGLY, PLLC, wrote to David Johnson to discuss retaining him as a consulting expert for the case Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank. Adam asked if David had time today or tomorrow for a discussion about the retention. He included his firm’s contact details: DECAMILLIS & MATTINGLY, PLLC, 138 S. 3rd Street, Louisville, Kentucky 40202, with phone 502-589-2822 and fax 502-589-2826, and he also noted at the end that the message contained a confidentiality and privilege notice.\n\nOver the next day, there was ongoing scheduling dialogue. Adam indicated that an afternoon meeting would work for him, and David Johnson proposed a 3:00 PM time in EST for the conversation. There were further exchanges about possible times, with Adam replying that the afternoon would work and David trying to reach him by phone. The thread shows multiple correspondents being cc’d, including Robert Mattingly, Lauren Byrn, Taylor Brown, and Aaron Whaley.\n\nOn September 12, 2025, David Johnson wrote again to Adam Redden, noting that he could discuss either that day or the next afternoon and offering a concrete time window. In parallel, David attached a retainer consulting agreement, a CV, a Litigation Summary, and a 2025 Fee Schedule to the thread (the attachment notes indicate that fee information was contained in Section 5). Adam’s responses and the ongoing exchange continued, with references to the confidentiality and privilege notices typical of these communications.\n\nLater in September, there was a discussion about sending and executing the retainer agreement and related case materials. On September 30, 2025, David asked Adam whether the retainer consulting agreement had been executed and whether it had been mailed along with any case information, or if it had already been sent. Adam replied later that day that he planned to send the retainer check and the executed agreement within the week, and he noted that he was waiting on some dates for an inspection.\n\nOn October 1, 2025, Adam informed David that he expected to have the retainer check and executed agreement out to him that week. The thread also reiterates the standard confidential notices included in each email.\n\nThe matter then moved toward scheduling an inspection. On October 15, 2025, Adam asked David whether he had availability on October 27 or October 29 to perform an inspection at the bank in Corbin, Kentucky, noting that it would be about a three-hour drive for Adam and proposing around 12:00 p.m. ET on either day. David replied the same day that he could do October 29 at 12:30 p.m. EST and requested a confirmation plus a good time to discuss the scope of the inspection beforehand.\n\nOn October 16, 2025, Adam confirmed that they were set for October 29 and indicated he was fairly open on October 24, 27, or 28 for a phone call to discuss the scope. David responded that he would attempt to reach Adam in the early afternoon on the 24th and would try again on the 27th if he missed him. Adam followed up on October 17, 2025, providing his cell phone number (502-905-4700) in case he could not be reached at the office, and restated his firm’s contact details: DECAMILLIS & MATTINGLY, PLLC, 138 S. 3rd Street, Louisville, KY 40202, with the same phone and fax numbers. The email also reiterates the confidentiality and privilege notices standard to the correspondence.\n\nThroughout the thread, the communications include the usual professional signatures with firm addresses and phone numbers, and each message contains confidentiality notices indicating the information is privileged and intended for the recipient only. There is also mention of scheduled communications and potential in-person inspection logistics related to the Amy Mills v. Forcht Bank matter, including the anticipated inspection in Corbin, Kentucky, and the planned discussion of the scope of that inspection prior to the visit.",
