According to Tennessee state law, the terms \\u201cproviders or the provider's third-party release of information providers\\u201d are specified in TN Code 63-2-101. ChartSwap does not fall under these categories, as it acts as an agent for the requestor, not as a \\u201cprovider\\u201d or a \\u201cthird-party release of information provider.\\u201d Therefore, the statute and associated fee limits do not apply to ChartSwap. Consequently, the Digital Delivery fee and other charges are considered to be within acceptable limits and will remain the same., 2024.09.30 Recvd CMR/CMB w/Certification - Billing Show TN & KY Medicaid\",\n   157\t    \"date_treatment_completed\": \"2022-12-04\",\n   158\t    \"medical_bills_received_date\": \"45565.0\",\n   159\t    \"date_medical_bills_requested\": null,\n   160\t    \"medical_bills_follow_up_date\": null,\n   161\t    \"date_medical_records_received\": \"45565.0\",\n   162\t    \"date_medical_records_requested\": null\n   163\t  },\n   164\t  {\n   165\t    \"id\": 466,\n   166\t    \"created_at\": \"2025-08-02T19:48:21.029589+00:00\",\n   167\t    \"updated_at\": \"2025-08-02T19:48:21.029589+00:00\",\n   168\t    \"project_name\": \"Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022\",\n   169\t    \"billed_amount\": 72568.5,\n   170\t    \"number_of_visits\": null,\n   171\t    \"provider_full_name\": \"Air Evac EMS Inc Prestonsburg\",\n   172\t    \"settlement_payment\": 0,\n   173\t    \"date_treatment_started\": \"2022-12-03\",\n   174\t    \"medical_provider_notes\": \"2024.04.01 CRR Sent via Fax -

12/13/2023: Summons \u2013 Return of Service\n- 01/01/2024: Answer\n- 01/23/2024: **Calendar Order**; **Order to Consolidate** (listed in the docket JSON \u201cdocuments\u201d section)\n- 04/11/2024: Notice of Service\n- 04/29/2024: Answer (appears to correspond to the filed answers/response set)\n- 10/10/2024: Notice of Hearing; Motion to Compel; Exhibit; Tendered Document\n- 10/14/2024: Notice \u2013 Other\n- 10/17/2024: Interrogatories; and multiple \u201cAnswer to Interrogatory/Response to RFP\u201d PDFs\n- 01/17/2025 and 02/06/2025: Notices to Take Deposition\n- **Events:** the scraper returned `events: []` (no future-dated events captured)\n\n## 2) What we already had in the Litigation folder\nBefore today, the case already had a lot of pleadings/discovery correspondence plus a **partial** set of downloaded KYeCourts PDFs (4 items) in:\n- `projects/Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022/Litigation/KYeCourts_Downloads/`\n\n## 3) What was missing vs. the docket, and what I did\n### A) Docket items that *are downloadable as PDFs* (Images)  \nThose were not all present in our case folder initially, so I **downloaded the missing KYeCourts PDFs** into the case\u2019s folder:\n\n**Now located here:**\n- `projects/Debra-Marshall-MVA-12-3-2022/Litigation/KYeCourts_Downloads/`\n\n**Key additions obtained from KYeCourts and saved to that folder include:**\n- `2023-12-13_SUMMONS_-_RETURN_OF_SERVICE.pdf`\n- `2024-01-01_ANSWER.pdf`\n- `2024-04-11_NOTICE_OF_SERVICE.pdf`\n- `2024-04-29_ANSWER.pdf`\n- `2024-10-10_NOTICE_OF_HEARING.pdf`\n- `2024-10-10_MOTION_TO_COMPEL.pdf`\n- `2024-10-10_EXHIBIT.pdf`\n- `2024-10-10_TENDERED_DOCUMENT.pdf`\n- `2024-10-14_NOTICE_-_OTHER.pdf`\n- `2024-10-17_INTERROGATORIES.pdf`\n- `2024-10-17_ANSWER_TO_INTERROGATORY_RESPONSE_TO_REQUEST_FOR_PRODUCTION_OF_DOCUMENTS.pdf` (+ `_1` and `_2`)\n- `2025-01-17_NOTICE_TO_TAKE_DEPOSITION.pdf`\n- `2025-02-06_NOTICE_TO_TAKE_DEPOSITION.pdf`\n\nSo as to **everything KYeCourts makes available as downloadable PDFs for this case**, we now have them saved in the Litigation folder.\n\n### B) Docket items listed that were **NOT available via the download tool**\nThe docket JSON lists:\n- **CALENDAR ORDER (01/23/2024)**\n- **ORDER TO CONSOLIDATE (01/23/2024)**\n\nHowever, the KYeCourts download tool\u2019s \u201cImages\u201d list (which is what it can actually download) does **not** include these two items, and I also do **not** see them elsewhere in the Litigation folder by filename/content search.\n\n**Action item:** if you want those two documents in-file, we likely need to pull them manually from KYeCourts (if accessible outside the Images area) or request copies from the clerk / opposing counsel.\n\n## 4) Future dates\nFrom the scraper outputs:\n- **No future-dated events were returned** (events array is empty).\n- The latest docket document dates shown are **01/17/2025** and **02/06/2025**, which are in the past as of today (12/12/2025).\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a quick \u201cDocket-to-File Crosswalk\u201d table (docket item \u2192 exact saved PDF filename/path) and drop it into `Reports/` for a clean audit trail.", "index": 0, "id": "msg_0f6397229e11d25d00693c8dcfd6188194bb0b6bdb6aaecb56"}], "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata":
