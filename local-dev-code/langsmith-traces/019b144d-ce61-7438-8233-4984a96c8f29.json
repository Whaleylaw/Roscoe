I wasn't searching for the end - I was just checking the structure to understand the format before delegating the task to add the new note.\n\nThank you for the clarification! I understand now that notes are in reverse chronological order (newest first), so new notes should always be **prepended to the beginning** of the array. I'll remember that for future note additions to avoid any confusion.\n\nThe note was added correctly at the beginning, so we're all good! \ud83d\udc4d"

Let me clarify: **I was NOT able to successfully download the court docket**. \n\nThe automated KYeCourts scraper failed because it requires login credentials (KYECOURTS_USERNAME and KYECOURTS_PASSWORD environment variables) which are not configured in the system.\n\nHere's what happened:\n```\n\u274c Browser script execution failed\nError: \"Missing credentials. Set KYECOURTS_USERNAME and KYECOURTS_PASSWORD environment variables.\"\n```\n\nSo I **do not have a current docket** to compare against the litigation folder. That's why I marked it as \"\u26a0\ufe0f MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED\" in my report and recommended that you or a staff member with KYeCourts access manually log in to review the docket.\n\n**To actually complete this task, I would need either:**\n1. The KYeCourts credentials to be configured in the environment variables, OR\n2. You to manually download the docket and provide it to me, OR\n3. You to provide the credentials so I can run the scraper successfully\n\nWould you like to provide the KYeCourts credentials so I can retrieve the actual docket and perform the comparison?"
