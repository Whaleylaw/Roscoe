## Risk Assessment

### LOW RISK ✅
- Starting with free tools (PubMed, Semantic Scholar, Playwright)
- Using open-source infrastructure (PostgreSQL)
- Phased deployment with pilot testing
- Most tools have free tiers or trial periods

### MEDIUM RISK ⚠️
- Integration complexity (mitigated by Composio platform)
- Staff learning curve (mitigated by phased rollout + training)
- Cost management (mitigated by free tiers and usage monitoring)

### HIGH RISK ❌ (All Mitigated)
- **Data breach** → Use HIPAA-compliant tools with BAA
- **Privilege waiver** → Configure encryption and access controls
- **Bar ethics violation** → Disclose AI use, maintain attorney oversight
- **Web scraping legal issues** → Use legitimate credentials, avoid circumvention

## Decision Framework

### Deploy Phase 1 If...
✅ You handle personal injury cases with medical records
✅ You have 1+ paralegals spending 20+ hours/case on medical review
✅ You want 35-45% efficiency improvement
✅ You can invest $0-2,370/month

### Wait on Phase 1 If...
❌ You're a solo attorney with no paralegals
❌ You don't handle PI cases with medical records
❌ You can't allocate time for implementation
❌ You need ROI in <2 months (though payback can be 2-4 months)

### Deploy Phase 2 If...
✅ Phase 1 ROI is proven
✅ You have 5+ paralegals
✅ You need case management integration
✅ You want 75-85% capability improvement
✅ You can invest $1,910-9,275/month additional

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I start with just the free tools?
**A: Absolutely!** Deploy PubMed, Semantic Scholar, Playwright, PostgreSQL, and HuggingFace models at $0/month. Prove value before investing in paid tools.

### Q: Do I need all 13 Tier 1 tools immediately?
**A: No.** Prioritize based on your biggest pain points:
- Medical research → PubMed + Semantic Scholar
- Document processing → Azure DI + Upstage
- Data management → PostgreSQL + Vectara
- Web automation → Playwright + AgentQL
- Batch analysis → E2B

### Q: What if my firm already uses Clio/MyCase/PracticePanther?
**A: Great!** Use Composio to integrate your existing case management system instead of deploying Office 365/Salesforce.

### Q: How do I handle HIPAA compliance?
**A: Use tools with BAA:** Azure DI, Office 365, Salesforce, Vectara all offer HIPAA compliance with Business Associate Agreements.

### Q: Will this replace my paralegals?
**A: No.** This makes paralegals 2-3x more productive, allowing them to handle more cases or provide higher-quality work on existing cases.

### Q: What about attorney oversight?
**A: Critical.** Deploy Lemon Agent (Tier 2) for human-in-the-loop workflows. All AI analysis should be reviewed by paralegals, with attorney supervision for critical decisions.
