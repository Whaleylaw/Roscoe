User: Estate of Betty Prince 3:24:13 PM
Roscoe: I have the context loaded for the Estate of Betty Prince case (Client: Robert Prince).

I see the case is currently in the Litigation phase. I also note a critical alert regarding the Statute of Limitations (SOL) deadline of July 14, 2022, which appears to have passed.

How can I assist you with this file today?

User: We've just implemented the workflow system. The workflow status I think is still on the onboarding phase. Obviously we're not in that phase, but I want to progress through all of the workflows systematically to test them. So can you check and see what phase and what the workflow status is?

Roscoe: The workflow status for the Estate of Betty Prince case is currently set to the Litigation phase.

While you suspected it might still be in the onboarding phase, the internal data shows that all landmarks for the Onboarding, File Setup, Treatment, and Demand phases are already marked as Complete.

The "0/11 landmarks complete" you likely saw refers specifically to the checkpoints within the current Litigation phase. Since this case has been active for some time, many of these "not started" landmarks can be updated immediately based on the documents I see in the file (like the Complaint and Discovery responses).

Current Workflow Status
Current Phase: Litigation
Track Progress:
Onboarding: 100% Complete
File Setup: 100% Complete
Treatment: 100% Complete
Demand/Negotiation: 100% Complete
Litigation: 0% Complete (0/11 landmarks)
Litigation Landmarks (To Be Updated)
Based on a quick scan of the case folder, I can see we have already completed several of these. For example:

Complaint Filed: I found Complaint-PL-Med-Neg.docx in the root folder.
Written Discovery: I see multiple discovery documents, including 2023-06-26-Prince-NOS-Resp-to-DC-2nd-Disc-Req.docx and RFA-with-responses.docx.
Would you like me to go through and systematically mark these Litigation landmarks as complete to bring the workflow status in line with the actual progress of the case?
