Tools for the Coding Agent.

Shell tool is now provided via ShellToolMiddleware (see agent.py).
Additional coding-specific tools can be added here as needed.

Examples of potential future tools:
- Code linter/formatter integration
- Test runner integration
- Git operations (commit, push, branch)
- Package manager operations (install dependencies)
- CI/CD integration tools
"""

# Tools will be defined here when needed
# Import required libraries at the top
# Define tool functions following LangChain tool patterns
